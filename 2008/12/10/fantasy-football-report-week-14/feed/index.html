		<description><![CDATA[The discrepancy in scoring in this league is much higher than other H2H leagues...so that&#039;s why the standings generally reflect the scoring.

SoB league: 608.14 points separates the league leader (me :D) from the bottom-feeder (X in this case).

So in a higher scoring league, H2H is a bit more accurate. In a lower scoring league, the &quot;flaws&quot; of H2H are revealed, but I like that I can win when having a bad week. I guarantee owners doing poorly in roto would definitely stop paying attention. Once you get down by 300 points, it&#039;s almost impossible to come back. In H2H, the impossible becomes possible...
