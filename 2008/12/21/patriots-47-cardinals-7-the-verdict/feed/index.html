		<description><![CDATA[Haha i highly doubt the Jets game will end before the Pats game. The NFL switched the times in a brilliant move...

Pats-Bills will be at 1 pm EST
Jets-Dolphins, Ravens-Jaguars will be at 4

If the Patriots win, the Jets can still get in if the Ravens lose, so they will have everything to play for regardless of the Pats&#039; result. And besides....why would they want Chad Pennington to goto the playoffs at their expense? J-E-T-S, JETS JETS JETS!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am not saying that a 40 point victory is unimpressive but, the Cardinals weren&#039;t trying and haven&#039;t been trying since they locked up their division.

Arizona hasn&#039;t cared for weeks and weren&#039;t going to risk injuring any of their starters before the playoffs. If they were still playing for something, then you would have seen a different game on Sunday.

As for Week 17...I hope the Jets game ends before ours. IF we beat Buffalo this week before the Dolphins/Jets game ends then Mangina will see that there is no point in playing and he will just throw in the towel and let Miami win. It&#039;s petty yes but, you know it is true.

To ease the mind, lets pray that Baltimore loses.]]></description>
