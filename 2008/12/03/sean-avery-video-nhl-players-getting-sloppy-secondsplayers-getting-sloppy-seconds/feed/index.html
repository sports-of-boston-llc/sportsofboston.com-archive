If you ever have the opportunity to catch a game with Carell, be wary of the many sexual innuendos hockey entails (&#8221;So-and-so tries to ram it home&#8221;, &#8220;So-and-so pulls it out, but loses it&#8221;) and the “That’s what she said” quotes which are sure to follow.

		<description><![CDATA[I think Bettman needs Sean Avery. The Bruins are hot in Boston now (at least in my eyes), but if you&#039;re in an NHL city with a losing team, chances are that you&#039;re not caring unless you&#039;re a huge hockey fan.

I agree though, a suspension of more than three games would be ridiculous.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This should have been left to the Stars to deal with.  Not the league.  If his suspension is more than 3 games, then it should be paifully obvious that the NHL cares more about it&#039;s image than player safety.  Kudos to Mr. Gary Dickman on making Sean Avery news again.]]></description>
