		<description><![CDATA[Arizona would have won 10 games if they hadn&#039;t decided to slack off in recent weeks. Cardinals have a great offense and only dogged it becasue they didn&#039;t have to win.

As for Favre, I can&#039;t wait to have him as a Patriot next season along with Isaac Bruce and Fred Taylor.

		<description><![CDATA[It just can&#039;t be over already, the playoffs won&#039;t be the same without the Pats in the mix.  Arizona, Chicago, San Diego??? Borrring.  Bret Favre stinks.  I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if he shows up with his arm in a sling, blaming his performance on his shoulder.  Another example of ego pushing someone to play beyond their productive years - go home Brett!]]></description>
