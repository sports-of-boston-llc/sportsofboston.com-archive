		<description><![CDATA[BKH - This is fun isn&#039;t it? haha

Ken, these are all valid points. 

Ray Allen has seriously elevated his game. I think a lot of it is the rest of the team finding the right shots for Ray. He seems to be more comfortable with the offense and it&#039;s made the team that much better.

Kevin Garnett has had a lot to do with Perk&#039;s improved play. He&#039;s always played hard and tough, but he&#039;s never seemed to play this smart. Perk is choosing the right times to be aggressive, and it&#039;s really paid off for him.

And Rajon Rondo...he just gets better and better. He now is playing to his strengths (his speed and ball handling) and is blowing away some older and slower point guards. Chris Paul may be the best point guard in the NBA, but Rondo is probably one of the best in the Eastern Conference.

I could argue that the Celtics should have four players in the All-Star Game (KG, Pierce, Ray Allen, Rondo) much like the Pistons did a few years ago.

An improved bench will make this team nearly unbeatable (even more so than they already are).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seems to me that the winning streak - and the whole season so far - is the result of 3 major changes this year.  First, the amazing Ray Allen performance.  He&#039;s returned to his pre-Celtic form (with the addition of some fine defensive efforts), and operates like a well oiled machine.  I was more than ready to trade him after his dismal performance in the second part of last year.  Boy am I glad no one listened to me!

Second, is the stunning improvement in Kendrick Perkins.  Suddenly, he&#039;s not fouling out.  Suddenly, he&#039;s learned to go right up with the basketball to score.  And his defensive presence cannot be denied.  A remarkable turnaround.

Third, Rajon Rondo&#039;s continued development.  He&#039;s not the best point guard in the NBA, but he&#039;s certainly capable of terrific games, and his floor generalship is in the top echelon.  If he can ever give us 15 points a game in addition to his fantastic passing, the sky is his limit.

So, the above combined with the balanced attack of Pierce and Garnett has made for one hell of a season.  The big question mark is the bench, which can&#039;t seem to be consistent.  If Rivers ever gets that straightened out, nobody&#039;s going to beat this team.]]></description>
