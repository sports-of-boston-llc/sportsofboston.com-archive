		<description><![CDATA[I definitely agree on Varitek.  It would be ok to bring him back for a year or so, however, with Boras as his agent my assumption is, it&#039;s going to be prohibitive, primarily in terms of length.  I like the rotation: Beckett, Dice-K, Lester, Wakefield are a great three and solid four.  Masterson would be a great five, but he seems destined for the bullpen.  I don&#039;t want to spend huge dollars for a four or five as it seems to be overkill.  The risk-reward seems out of whack there.  I heard a Lugo-Willis deal was being bandied about, and that would seme worthwhile to take a chance on Willis, since, as you mentioned, losing Lugo seems to be a priority.  The bullpen was a little lacking this season and Timlin is gone, though he wasn&#039;t great and won&#039;t be a huge loss at this point in his career.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tex is better because he&#039;s at least just as good offensively as Adam Dunn but also has gold glove defense.

He&#039;s a perfect 1st baseman, with no holes, and when you want the best team in baseball you don&#039;t want to settle with players with holes.

Oh and Boston isn&#039;t looking for another relief pitcher. Papelbon, Okajima, Delcarmen, Ramirez, Lopez, Masterson?, Bard?, all will play prominent roles. Boston needs to focus on looking for another starter though.

And the Red Sox are looking for a 4th outfielder after the loss of Crisp. 

The Julio Lugo-Eric Byrnes talks broke down, but getting rid of Lugo&#039;s contract is a huge part of this off-season it seems.

The Rangers are holding out on trading a catcher. Right now it won&#039;t take any less than Masterson+. 

Right now Varitek and Boras seem to be negotiating for a multi-year deal. The years seem to be the sticking point not the money. As the Red Sox offered Varitek salary arbitration which would have got him 10 million+.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with KC, he strikes out way too much.  If we get Dunn, like Tex, we have to move someone and I&#039;d rather have all the guys in place over a Dunn.  Tex, on the other hand, is worth moving guys for.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[He is so poor at putting the ball in play. If he were good at that...his OBP would be like .500

The Red Sox do not like his massive amount of strikeouts, which kills rallies. When you strikeout, you are not giving yourself a chance to reach base unless it&#039;s a rare wild pitch.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If we can&#039;t get Teixeira, then why not Adam Dunn?

Dunn has the power we need with at least 40 HR in every season since 2004. He has driven in at least 100 RBI in 4 of the last 5 seasons and has scored 99+ runs in 4 of the last 5 season as well.

People in Boston will hate him for his batting average (.247 career) but he gets on base (.381 career OBP). Even if he can&#039;t hit, he still reaches base and scores.

He can play 1st base or he can play the OF. 

Dunn is so unappreciated.]]></description>
