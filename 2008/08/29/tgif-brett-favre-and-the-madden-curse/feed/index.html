If that isn&#039;t bad karma, I don&#039;t know what is.

Not to mention, Favre&#039;s terrible offensive peformance got Mangini fired. No other player who has graced the cover of Madden created unemployment for their head coach.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While I believe there may be something to the curse, I&#039;ll have to disagree with you on Marshall Faulk. That year, he did rush for less than 1000 yards, but he also still had 80 catches for 537 yards. He steadily got worse because once a RB hits 30, their career is basically over (unless you&#039;re Curtis Martin).

I&#039;m willing to guarantee that if Faulk was on the cover after winning the Super Bowl with the Rams, he still would&#039;ve been good the following two years.

The problem with the Madden Curse is that we reach for it to work. Like if Favre plays well and plays every game but the Jets miss the playoffs, that&#039;s not the curse at work. If he retires after missing the playoffs...that&#039;s not the curse at work. The only way to prove it is to take football&#039;s iron man down and out for one game. If that happens...i&#039;m a believer!]]></description>
