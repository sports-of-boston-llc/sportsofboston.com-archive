		<description><![CDATA[At least one thing hasn&#039;t changed and that&#039;s Belichick&#039;s way with words. After the game he had this to say:

&quot;Belichick shed little light on when Brady might play.

Asked if he would have played had the game been during the regular season, Belichick said Sunday night, &quot;Well, it&#039;s not a regular-season game.&quot;

When asked if he would characterize Brady&#039;s absence as precautionary, he said, &quot;I wouldn&#039;t characterize it.&quot;

Classic Belichick !]]></description>
