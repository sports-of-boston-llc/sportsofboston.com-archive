		<description><![CDATA[Nothing will happen to Pierce as a part of this.  The police said they handcuffed him because he was upset (visibly) and he&#039;s a big guy.  After he calmed down and they probably figured out who he was,....he was let go.  Sad what cops will do in Vegas at 3am to get an autograph.  LOL.]]></description>
