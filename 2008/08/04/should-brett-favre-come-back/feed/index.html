		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Ken for the agreement. I understand why the Packers are doing what they&#039;re doing, but they could&#039;ve done it in a much quieter manner. Like KC said, though, the media doesn&#039;t help.

And KC you got your answer on the hang up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ken - I totally agree. I think the Packers have created this problem just as much as Favre has. ESPN and the media escalated it to new heights...I say just trade him and get it over with. What could be the hang up?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for an article that actually makes freaking sense! I can&#039;t believe that there was such a controversy about this whole situation. If Brett can play well why not welcome him back? The media is the one that made this a circus! Why the Packers didn&#039;t jump to bring Brett back is beyond me. I love the Packers but it doesn&#039;t mean I agree with the management&#039;s decisions. Why would you want to bench the guy who gives you the best shot at a Superbowl?]]></description>
