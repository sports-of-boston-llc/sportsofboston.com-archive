		<description><![CDATA[Oh Dev, Dev, come on man...that is just so WRONG!  They got married before he was famous, but now that he&#039;s a big shot and can get any chick he wants, that makes it okay for him to dump his wife?!?  Typical, but I have to say I was shocked by this.  I thought Tek was one of the good guys, guess not!  Maybe the personal life accounts for his slump.  He&#039;s always been my favorite player, so I hope he gets his sh#*t together!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jean,

I&#039;d like to say all you women are alike too! I think that a man AND woman should be attracted to their spouse. And let&#039;s be honest, if you&#039;re famous and want to get married, forget love, the reason you&#039;re with that person is simply because you&#039;re rich and famous and they want a piece of it. Maybe she was there before he was famous. But maybe it&#039;s time Tek cashed in and moved up. He&#039;s GOT to be jealous of his teammates. Honestly, you look at the other ladies of the Sox, she doesn&#039;t compare. Sure, she could be a nice person and all that but anyone can be nice, it&#039;s how good-looking you are that people judge first. Shallow and terrible as it may be, it&#039;s just the society we&#039;re born into. 

It&#039;s the same reason you women read endless magazines filled with images and articles telling you what&#039;s wrong with you and what mold to fit. I always do find it ironic that women go out of their way to doll themselves up, but if a guy pays &quot;too much&quot; attention to looks he&#039;s an ass, it&#039;s great logic. The new thing is saying a woman is supposed to make herself pretty &quot;for herself&quot;, when really that&#039;s the media trying to make themselves look angelic. The truth is people want to look good because attention is what makes them feel good. 

If you&#039;ve got a problem with my little blurb, you&#039;ve got a bigger problem with society as a whole. If you don&#039;t like it, stop wearing makeup and see where that gets you.
