		<description><![CDATA[Only VC, MJ, and Dwight Howard could do that with such intensity. Seriously it wasn&#039;t that bad. KG didn&#039;t jump high and Lebron had already achieved maximum altitude. Thank God KG didn&#039;t fall or the media would rip him apart]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This &quot;losing away&quot; seems a bit one-sided. Let us also not forget that since the Celtics are un-defeated at home, that also means its opponents are also winless on the road. Maybe the home court advantage is really that significant. Good thing they have home court throughout.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d say Kobe can do that dunk...and maybe Vince Carter. 

But anyway...until the Celtics can prove they can win one road game, I&#039;m predicting they wont win on the road this entire playoffs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t really know what to say.

-Doc taking Rondo out for the first seven minutes of the fourth is questionable at best considering Sam Cassell was horrid from the field and Rondo was the only one making plays for much of the game

-Paul Pierce played something like 41 minutes but it seemed to me like he was never really in control while on the floor.

-I thought the defense as a whole played pretty well for the game, the Cavs made some good plays and hit the big shots when needed

-Lebron&#039;s dunk at the end is something MAYBE two or three other guys on the planet could do. Incredible ups.

-I wasn&#039;t even that pissed after the game last night, because at this point I don&#039;t really go into a road game feeling like they are going to pull it out. 

-I&#039;m very afraid that we could drop Game 5 and home and that&#039;s probly the ball game.

-I hope these guys realize that this year might be their best chance to win an NBA title. They played a Hawks team who is only going to improve, they are playing a Cavs team which will sooner or later get some big help for Lebron and they aren&#039;t getting any younger. Eddie House, Posey, Cassell and PJ Brown all probly won&#039;t re-sign for the veteran minimum next year either.]]></description>
