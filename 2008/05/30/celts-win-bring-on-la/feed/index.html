		<description><![CDATA[Gutsy!  That&#039;s what it was, as the Celts came roaring back in the fourth quarter.  Congratulations to all the players, especially Paul Pierce who I can still picture just shaking his head and laughing after being victimized by what is perhaps the worst foul call in the history of professional basketball.  He would have been justified if he&#039;d thrown the ball in Bennett Salvatore&#039;s face, but he kept his cool and set an example for the whole team (if not the entire NBA) when he just walked away without getting a technical after being knocked down and denied a possible 4 point play by that indefensible call at a critical juncture.

It seemed like the whole team just said &quot;Okay, that&#039;s how it&#039;s going to be.  Let&#039;s just win this thing.&quot;  And oh did they.  Bring on L.A.  Just like old times, huh?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a nice stat to read: The Celtics are the fourth Boston team (out of five major pro sports teams) to appear in the league&#039;s most recent championship.

The others:
Red Sox vs. Rockies (World Series) - WIN
Revolution vs. Dynamo (MLS Cup) - LOSS
Patriots vs. Giants (Super Bowl) - LOSS
Celtics vs. Lakers (NBA Finals) - ???

For right now, before any analysis, and even though the Celtics can now win on the road, I have the C&#039;s beating LA in 7 games.]]></description>
