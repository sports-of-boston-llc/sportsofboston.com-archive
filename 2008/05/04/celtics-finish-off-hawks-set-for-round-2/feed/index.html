		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comments Ken and I completely agree with everything you said here. I think Perk did a great job the other day and hopefully this will transition to the Cleavland series, Zaza really just ran into KG, Eddie House needs more time and I think he may get it as well as Tony Allen against Cleavland, and it was great to see them win so convincingly. It showed how fed up the Celtics were with that series that they were going to end it and end it with style.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A few final thoughts on game 7:

1. Kudos to Kendrick Perkins for playing his finest playoff game.  I don&#039;t like Kendrick&#039;s game usually (dumb pick fouls and wasted scoring opportunities), but early in game 7, he was THE MAN, scoring and grabbing rebounds and supplying an air of menace that set the tone for the game.
2. Garnett&#039;s take down of Zaza was a thing of epic (and perfectly legal) beauty.
3. The Celts better give some more time to Eddie House, and soon.  His shooting is so far off right now, that it&#039;s hard to see how he can be much help against Cleveland.  Let the man play, Doc, he&#039;s earned that right during the regular season, and that holds for Tony Allen as well.
4.  Thank you Celtics for winning that damned game so convincingly!]]></description>
