		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s how I see it:
Celtics over Cavs in 6: LeBron will win a game by himself, but the C&#039;s will get it done.  The Cavs remind me a little of young Jordan&#039;s Bulls where they&#039;d all watch him score 50 and lose a playoff series.  LeBron will do well, but he needs some help.
Pistons over Magic in 7: The Pistons aren&#039;t playing their championship defense of a few years ago, but they&#039;re still pretty good and good enough to get by Dwight Howard and Co.  I second Matt&#039;s opinion on Stan van Gundy.
Lakers over Utah in 5: This is just talent difference.  The Lakers can score from anywhere on the floor and the Jazz look lost offensively sometimes.
Spurs over Hornets in 7: The Spurs have no answer for Chris Paul, but he can&#039;t win it himself.  Popovich, Duncan, Parker, Ginobli and the rest know their roles and know how to win games this time of year.  This is the truest &quot;team&quot; in the sport right now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And now for the  &lt;a href=&quot;http://jaajoe.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;JaaJoe.com&lt;/a&gt; foolish predictions for the second round of the 07/08 NBA Play Offs.
 1.Jazz/Lakers. I think that Jerry Sloan is a slightly superior coach, but his slight superiority is due to the fact that, even though Phil Jackson is old enough to know better, at times he still falls into the trap of believing that he is more important than his players. In addition, I think that Utah is more mentally determined, and will take this series in seven games.
2. Magic/Pistons. Flip Saunders is a worthless coach. Stan Van Gundy is the hardest working coach in the NBA. Based solely on the coaching inequity, I pick the Magic to win in six.
3.Celtics/Cavaliers. Mike Brown is a better coach than Doc Rivers, but LeBron is still a distraction. Celtics in six.
4. Spurs/Hornets. Spurs in six.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[haha Joe Johnson proved that in Game 4, not in all of their wins. 

I say Celtics in 7 only because they can&#039;t be beaten at home in the playoffs and and they can&#039;t win on the road.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah thats right, I got the Cavs beating Boston. It&#039;s not that I want Cleveland to win, it is just that I think LeBron will dominate us as usual. We have proven that we can&#039;t win on the road in the playoffs, so if the Cavs win one game in Boston then they are set. 

Joe Johnson proved that one dominating player can take us out, so I think King James has our number.

Sorry.]]></description>
