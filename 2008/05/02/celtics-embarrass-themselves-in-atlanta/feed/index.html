		<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t agree more with both KC and Jeff concerning game 6. The really bizarre part of it all is that EVERYONE can see exactly what&#039;s going on here, with the exception, evidently, of Doc Rivers.  The sight of Sam Cassell once again starting the fourth quarter by walking the ball up the court had me screaming at the television set.  Once again, Doc allowed it to continue for half the quarter while Rondo sat on the bench. If you must give Rondo an extended rest (for God knows what reason) in every fourth quarter, at least put Eddie House in (yes, Jeff, you&#039;re absolutely right) and attempt to get some semblance of attack in your heralded &quot;attack&quot; offense.  
     I might also ask why players who make millions of dollars a year can&#039;t play more minutes in a critical game.  Are these guys just showing their age, or what?  What is Doc saving them for - next year?  
     Even should they win on Sunday, the Celtics are now in the unenviable position of having shown themselves to be totally vulnerable to any aggressive, athletic team. Remember how the Celts looked against Washington and Orlando in the regular season?  Evidently Atlanta sure remembers, and they&#039;re so confident now that they could easily grab a game in Boston.
   It&#039;s suddenly looking like Doc Rivers losing Coach of the Year was actually the correct decision.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[thoughts...

1.) WHERE IS EDDIE HOUSE?

2.) Embarrassing

3.) Free throw discrpency has nothing to do with refs, wayyyy too much jump shooting

4.) WHERE IS EDDIE HOUSE??

5.) Sam Cassell playing in the stretch is okay in some situations, but Rondo NEEDS to be in the game because of his slashing ability

6.) The sixth foul call on Pierce was BS, but he lost his cool yet again in a playoff game

7.) WHERE IS EDDIE HOUSE?

8.) Though they don&#039;t show up usually, the crowd in Atlanta seemed more frenzied than any NBA crowd I&#039;ve seen in a long time

9.) They&#039;ll take care of the Hawks in Game 7 and probly win by 20, but three road losses is very disconcerting

10.) The lack of composure on the floor in the fourth quarter was staggering last night

11.) WHERE THE HELL IS EDDIE HOUSE?!?!?

12.) Doc&#039;s job is and should be on the line Sunday afternoon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ack...no excuses, the Celtics deserved to lose tonight. Where are the points in the paint? This isn&#039;t the three-point shooting contest. The Celtics seemed to lose their composure in the 4th. 

We are in a tough spot for Sunday.]]></description>
