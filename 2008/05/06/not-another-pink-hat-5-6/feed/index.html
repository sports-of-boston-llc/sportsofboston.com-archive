		<description><![CDATA[chrsitian- it was words both sides say the same thing about each team. Nothing more.

jennfier- really look up video of a red sox fan walking in Yankee stadium getting hit with insults. 

they are words. you all saying only red sox fan take it to far really? yet this women took it beyond far.

		<description><![CDATA[Jennifer,
I went to see Guster last April at the Boston Opera house. Ryan Miller, the lead singer, was really happy to announce that they were responsible for bringing sunshine and good weather (it had rained for like 10 straight day) when they got to boston, and a sweep of whoever it was they just finished playing at home. mark this, it was not the yankees (i don&#039;t think but I could be wrong). 

The crowd went NUTS like he said &quot;i&#039;m giving each and every one of you 10 million dollars just for being here tonight...&quot; and then they started chanting Yankees Suck.

Um. okay. has nothing to do with guster, the weather, or whoever it was the sox just played. But the fans had to get &quot;Yankees Suck&quot; in somewhere in the concert. It totally wouldn&#039;t be boston without it. 

i just shook my head. dude. can we just get back to the music please?]]></description>

A striking irony is that just a few feet from there is a mural of Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe, who broke the color barrier in baseball by joining a Nashua minor-league team.

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the comment. I totally agree that Red Sox fans take the &quot;Yankees Suck&quot; chant too far. I mean, even when we lose we still chant it everywhere and anywhere, regardless of how inappropriate it may be. 

Also, what I forgot to mention is that this isn&#039;t only a Red Sox/Yankees thing. I almost got beat up once just for saying &quot;I don&#039;t like the Eagles&quot; in front of an Eagles fan. In general, alcohol, crowds, and sports just don&#039;t mix with some people and it&#039;s unfortunate for the rest of us who just love sports and love our teams.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I grew up on Long Island, and was raised a Red Sox Fan. For years and years i suffered taunts and got my ass beat for loving Fred Lynn, Carl Yastrzemski, and Pudge. 

I moved up here to Massachusetts for college and luckily have escaped the slings and arrows of Yankee fans for most of my adult life.

Ivonne was probably taunted for years because, well, Red Sox fans honestly take it a lil&#039;too far with the yankees suck chants anymore ... and she&#039;d probably had it up to her metaphorical eybrows with all that noise. I feel bad that she was so incredibly stupid as to think drunk people can reflex move out of the way of a speeding vehicle. 

i agree with you that clearly the yankees issue wasn&#039;t her only major malfunction... Overall, this was on all accounts completely unnecessary and the only ones who are going to suffer now are any kids who have lost a parent, either to death (not sure if the victim had any...) or to jail. 

just plain a waste all around.
