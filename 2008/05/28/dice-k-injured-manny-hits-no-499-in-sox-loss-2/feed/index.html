		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the praise. Yea maybe his loss wouldn&#039;t be catastrophic considering my previous post that said the Sox are stacked with starting pitching. 

I mean, I&#039;d rather him go and get 100% before he comes back, but I also don&#039;t want him vacationing to rehab during the season or something.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Are the Red Sox in trouble without Dice-K?  I don&#039;t think so.  Of course the injury doesn&#039;t appear to be serious, but if they were to lose him for a start or two, is the world going to end?  Probably not.  Don&#039;t get me wrong Dice has been our ace this year, but without him (as you mentioned in your previous post) we do have amazing depth at starting pitcher.  

Even though Timmy Wakefield struggled against the A&#039;s he&#039;s gonna get it together and we&#039;re going to get a W.  Only question left is will Manny hit 500 tonight!!!

Great blog!!!]]></description>
