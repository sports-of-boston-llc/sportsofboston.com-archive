		<description><![CDATA[Could the Celtics make it anymore interesting?  Oh my fault, could the refs have made it anymore interesting?  Of course they could have, they could&#039;ve put Billups on the line at the end of the game instead of Stuckey.  Hey genius, if you miss the front end of two, you&#039;re supposed to miss the second one too.  Your boy is wicked smaht.

		<description><![CDATA[Ray and Perk really had good games. I don&#039;t like Perk&#039;s attitude much of the time but when he isn&#039;t in foul trouble he can be a real asset. 

Ray might be out of his shooting slump but I won&#039;t get too excited until he has back to back games where he shoots well.

Great stat: Celts are 29-0 when leading 3 games to 2, so that bodes well.

Reffing was atrocious. Just atrocious.

In the playoffs, a win is a win, though they better close out better or the Pistons/lakers will nip one at the end.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A stunning performance by Kendrick Perkins....Ray Allen&#039;s best playoff game....clutch shots by KG, including a ridiculous 3 pointer off the backboard....hitting free throws in critical moments.....it took all of that to eke out a win over the Pistons, who just never give up.  I only hope that the Celts can somehow do it two straight games and get out of this series intact.  If they pull their every-other-game intensity stuff on Friday night, and stink up the Palace in Detroit, that 7th game is going to be a doozy.  Expect blood all over the court.

By the way, that crew of officials led by Kenny and Ed ought to be shot.  I imagine Tommy Heinsohn had to be resuscitated several times.]]></description>
