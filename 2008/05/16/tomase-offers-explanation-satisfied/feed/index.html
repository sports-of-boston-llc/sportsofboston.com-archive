		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s huge debates on WEEI about this same issue. They had Tony Massarotti (a Herald writer) on the Big Show and began arguing whether the Herald has an agenda against the Patriots or not. 

I wonder how an unchecked, low-sourced article about the Rams walk-through made it to print.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Boston Herald continues to pour gas on the fire. In todays Herald Tony Massarotti pretty much alienates any Patriots and possibly sports fans that the Herald may have had left. You can read the whole pathetic commentary at: http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/football/patriots/view.bg?&#038;articleid=1094171&#038;format=&#038;page=1&#038;listingType=pats#articleFull

I would suggest if you are a Pats fan you digest your supper before reading!
Here is an out take of some of the outrageous things he had to say: 
&quot;As you are a member of the public, we strongly urge you to review all media stories (particularly this continuously developing one) with a cynical and skeptical eye. Try to discern which members of the media show up to work wearing Patriots Super Bowl jackets, and which of your pathetic, repressed middle-aged neighbors wear their Tedy Bruschi [stats] jerseys on Sundays.&quot;

Ouch!]]></description>
