		<description><![CDATA[The offensive foul against Pierce was AWFUL! LeBron was running over to flop and also tried to steal the ball. How can you do both at once? 

I&#039;m really beginning to think that the only reason home teams are dominating is because the officiating is so one-sided. It&#039;s just not fair at all.

Maybe instead of Spygate...Congress should investigate NBA referees who cheat (LIKE TIM DONAGHY). That&#039;s much more of an issue of the &quot;integrity of the game&quot; than spying on the sidelines. Ugh.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[frustrating. short thoughts

-Leon Powe must be hurt

-EDDIE FREAKIN HOUSE! He&#039;s the reason the Celts were in it, great spark off the bench

-Allen needs to shoot well from the outside or he&#039;s useless on the court

-The call on Pierce was a travesty, that was the ball game right there. One of many suspicious calls on the night, but that was the biggest

-Wally&#039;s 3 with two minutes left was unbelievable, he was at least three feet behind the arc and that put the game outta reach

-Game 7. Woohoo.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Celtic&#039;s had their chances tonight, but failed to capitalize. Clearly the call on Pierce wasn&#039;t correct, but frankly the Celtics should never even be in such a position and it would be an insult to Cavaliers to say that was why they won the game. Let&#039;s count the stars on Cleveland......Lebron. Celtics...KG, Pierce, Allen. Is this one man that much better than all three of them combined? It&#039;s almost embarrassing at this point to see how far the Celtics have fallen from their regular season prowess.]]></description>
