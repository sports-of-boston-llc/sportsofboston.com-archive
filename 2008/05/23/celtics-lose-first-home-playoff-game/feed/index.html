		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Geoff completely.  It&#039;s unrealistic to expect that the Celts would go all the way through the playoffs and never lose a home game.  Now is the time to show us what they&#039;re really made of by winning at least one of the games in Detroit.  I also think the Celts match up better with Detroit than they did with Cleveland, but Detroit made every shot they needed last night, and they showed excellent poise when the Celts made their runs.  Give them credit - they just played a little bit better than the C&#039;s on that particular night.
     A big sigh of relief to see Ray Allen sink some baskets again.  Now let&#039;s hope it wasn&#039;t just a fluke.  Has it really been two months since he scored 25 points?  And I sure wish Rondo would take some of those wide open shots.  He&#039;s certainly capable of hitting them, and he&#039;s improved dramatically at the foul line.]]></description>
