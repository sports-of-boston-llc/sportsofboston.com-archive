		<description><![CDATA[I wonder what all the Paul Pierce naysayers are saying this morning.  Can we finally just admit that he&#039;s a great player, right up there with the Celtic legends?  I hope so, and I stand in awe of his performance when it really, really mattered.  This was surely an amazing duel between two great players, and let&#039;s face it, it was the &quot;Big One&quot; last night not the &quot;Big Three&quot;.  Had it been up to Garnett to save the day, it wouldn&#039;t have happened.  As analyst Kenny Smith so aptly said when talking about Garnett &quot;Can you think of another superstar in the past 20 years who wasn&#039;t capable of a 40 point plus game when it was needed&quot;?  Yeah, I love Garnett&#039;s intensity, but when the chips were down, it was Pierce who carried the load.
 As for Ray Allen, is there anyone out there who thinks that Seattle didn&#039;t know what it was doing when they let him go?  Is there anyone who wouldn&#039;t trade him right now - even up - for Delonte West?  Sorry Ray, but I&#039;ve felt you were semi-shot all year, and now you&#039;re really showing just how absurd the mention of you as a member of the Big Three is.  I&#039;m afraid age has caught up to the great shooter that once was.  Even if you finally manage to sink a few shots in the Detroit series, the question will always be asked &quot;Where were you in the first two series when Doc gave you every chance to prove your worth?&quot;

Special kudos to P.J. Brown for some terrific clutch plays, and to Eddie House for his intensity. Go Celts!  Beat Detroit!  Win a road game!!!!]]></description>
