		<description><![CDATA[The thing about Ray Allen is that he&#039;s the third option for the first time in his career. He&#039;s used to driving to the hoop and handling the scoring load.

He&#039;s just slumping now...a lot of times when shooters can&#039;t find their shot, they drive the lane. He&#039;s not supposed to do that because it&#039;s not his job. He&#039;s supposed to be lethal from three-point land. Ray started to drive more in Game 3, which will help him eventually.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Finally, a road win!!  Congrats to the Celts, especially that great defensive effort, and to the bench players who really were the stars of the game (besides Garnett, who played brilliantly).

So here&#039;s my plan:  Assuming Ray Allen is still on the team next year, wait until he has two good games in a row (if that&#039;s actually possible) and trade him immediately to anyone dumb enough to think he&#039;s still the old Ray Allen.  Don&#039;t be too picky - just get someone at least 6&#039;3&#039;&#039; who can hit at least 35% from the three point line and can dribble well enough not to hit his feet with the ball while he&#039;s moving outside the circle, and is also capable of guarding Wally Sczcerbiac. Got to be an improvement.  Whadda ya think?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This was a great game for the Celtics and I guess I was right about them being due for a road win. Hopefully this momentum carries over to game 4 and the Celts take that. Who knows...maybe they can get out of this in 5? (I knocked on wood after typing that)]]></description>
