		<description><![CDATA[I for one am very much looking forward to Friday night&#039;s game in Cleveland. As much as I may think I will jinx the Celtics by saying they might win I&#039;m going to say it anyway. Look at game 4 and 5 to help prove my point. Besides the fourth quarter in game 4 the Celtics remained in the game and it was close the whole way through which started to prove the Celtics might come through on the road at some point. Also, Doc Rivers is finally realizing some of the coaching mistakes he has made in some of the other playoff games I&#039;ve noticed. Game 5 he actually let Rajon Rondo start the fourth quarter and I believe he played all if not most of it. The last few games Cassell had been out there starting the fourth and getting nothing done. Doc also mentioned in his post game interview on Wednesday that he knew Sam was struggling and will give the ball to Eddie House in the future more. Good idea here I think. So I might be crazy but I think the Celtics might snap their road woes and take one in Cleveland on Friday. It&#039;s got to happen at some point, so lets just hope it happen on Friday.]]></description>
