		<description><![CDATA[John Tomase should be fired, period!!  His false story was a distraction to Patriot team officials and coach Belichick and may have influenced Super Bowl preparations.  He bears responsibility for the team&#039;s lack of focus and eventual loss.  Fire him, fire him, fire him!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think he&#039;ll be fired, mostly because he&#039;ll stick to his source (and we&#039;ll probably never know who that was). At most, he can write a correction note IF he feels he was in the wrong. 

Again, if he went on one source&#039;s word and that person was not Matt Walsh, then he should be held accountable. 

As far as the Herald goes, they can deny the media credential if they want, but probably won&#039;t. The organization should and will take the high ground and not punish the Herald as a whole, but best of luck to &quot;Big John&quot; getting an exclusive with anyone on the team next season.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Belichick has already admitted to taping since 2000 including &#039;03, &#039;04 and &#039;05. I beleive the confusion is that he said that he had not kept any of the tapes prior to 2006. The only ones that seem to exist are the ones the washed up golf pro Walsh has.
From ESPN:
NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said in a statement:
&quot;There are tapes of five opponents in six games between the 2000 and 2002 seasons,&quot; the statement said. &quot;The tapes are consistent with the findings of our prior investigation. There are no tapes of any opponent walk-throughs, no Super Bowl tapes, none of that. 

&quot;So, again, these are tapes of opponents&#039; coaching signals. It&#039;s what we already knew and, as [ESPN] reported back in September, Belichick admitted to the commissioner [Roger Goodell] that he had engaged in this practice dating back to 2000.&quot; 
There is nothing that Walsh claims to have to warrant any further punishment. This looks like a done deal !]]></description>
