		<description><![CDATA[THAT was some playoff basketball. Back and forth, good defense, solid offense, big shot by Eddie House. Great performance.

I did lose it once though on one of our players. When the Celts were up 9 in the third and we had those two or three steals in a row, Rondo came down court and found Ray Allen WIDE OPEN on the break on the corner behind the arc and I think everyone in the building was ready to lose it and he clanks the shot, Detroit comes down and Rip scores two for a big five point swing.

I kicked around a few things because he MAKES that shot in the regular season but now one of &#039;the greatest shooters in NBA history&#039; can&#039;t make a wide open 3 on the break which would have given his team a HUGE lead? Gimme a break. If he&#039;s not hitting shots he needs to take a Sam Cassell like break!

Other than that, solid performance. Though I predicted the Pistons winning in 6, I really truly believe that if the Celts win Game 2, they are gonna be very tough to beat because A) Chances are they will win a road game and B) Paul Pierce looks possessed right now!]]></description>
