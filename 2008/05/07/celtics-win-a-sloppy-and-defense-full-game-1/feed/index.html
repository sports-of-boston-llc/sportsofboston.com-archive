		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sure there&#039;s worse than LeBron..he did finish with 9 board and 9 assists.

As far as three potential hall-of-famers with a horrible combined game....yeah that has to be some sort of record]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can anyone think of a worse single game playoff performance than LeBron&#039;s (2-18 FG, 10 turnovers, and blown layup in the waning seconds)? 

Or a worse combined playoff performance than LeBron, Pierce, and Ray Ray (4-36 FG, more turnovers than point [19-16])?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well Jeff I hope you&#039;re right about it going six games instead of seven. I know that&#039;s only one more game but you just feel better when it doesn&#039;t have to go to seven, but we&#039;ll see what the Celtics can do on the road since I&#039;m not too worried about them at home. Ken I completely agree with you and I&#039;m a little nervous of how Lebron is going to retaliate in the rest of the games after such a poor performance last night. Ray will hopefully find his groove tomorrow night and I&#039;m sure he will be fine. Remember he only took four shots total it wasn&#039;t like he was 0-20 from the floor or anything. Also, I would like to know where Eddie House has been as well. It&#039;s very strange to not see him in the games anymore.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Man, was that an ugly game!!  Neither team deserved to win, and it came down to a case of which team was slightly worse than the other. Does this mean that Pierce must sacrifice himself in every game in order to try to control James?  I could accept that tradeoff, except that Ray Allen seems to be on one of his &quot;pathetic scoring ability compared to the old days&quot; streaks.  This happened several times during the regular season, but nobody wanted to talk it about very much as the team kept winning anyway.  Hopefully, he&#039;ll pull himself together and not look as pathetic as a shooter, driver and ball passer as he did in that first game.
Glad to see that Tony Allen got a few minutes of meaningful playing time, but does anybody know what Eddie House did to piss off Doc Rivers?  What a slap in the face for a guy who did so much during the regular season.  With Ray Allen unable to hit the broad side of a barn, it wouldn&#039;t have killed Doc to give House at least a chance to hit some himself.  Hard to see how it could have been any worse.
Let&#039;s hope it was just opening night jitters.  You certainly can&#039;t expect James to have a night like that again.  As for Ray Allen, well the jury is still out. Please, Ray, make me eat my words!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Talk about stealing one. Ray with 0 and Pierce with 4.

I think this was the best chance for the Cavs to win a game in Boston. I&#039;m liking my Celtics in 6 pick, I don&#039;t see the Cavs having an answer to Kevin Garnett as Atlanta did with Al Horford.

Let&#039;s blow them out tomorrow and put any doubt to rest on who owns home court advantage.]]></description>
