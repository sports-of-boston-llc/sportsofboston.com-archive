		<description><![CDATA[Well after Game 2 I predicted that the Celts would lose Game 3 and then take Game 4 and 5. It still didn&#039;t make it any better to see your team down 43-16 and for all intents and purposes the game is over. 

The defensive intensity definitely wasn&#039;t there but the Celts made a decision that LeBron and Big Z weren&#039;t going to beat them so they left guys like Ben Wallace, Delonte and Wally open on the weak side and they just hit their shots.

One thing that was VERY disconcerting was that the Celts didn&#039;t shoot a single free throw until there was about 3 minutes to go in the FIRST HALF. You gotta take it to the rim boys!

One side note, that &quot;charge&quot; call called on KG when he nudged the flopper Delonte was an ATROCIOUS call. No wonder Doc was hot.

LeBron wants to be an actor I think. Yes, it was a flagrent, but he didn&#039;t have to lie motionless on the floor for 2 minutes then pop up and take the ball out of bounds. Who does he think he is? Christiano Ronaldo!?? (soccer reference)

Bottom line is, I can see them taking Game 4. If not, they&#039;ll come back home having a 6-0 record at home and 0-5 on the road and they would be very vulnerable to losing the series.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is really getting old.  I&#039;m thoroughly disgusted by this inability to win, or even look like winners, on the road.  How can you possibly be the best team in the NBA in road wins for the regular season, yet look so helpless in postseason on the other team&#039;s court?  It&#039;s downright embarassing, and a total mystery to me.

And wasn&#039;t it great to see Wally sinking all those shots he couldn&#039;t hit when he was a Celtic as he completely outplayed Ray Allen? And wasn&#039;t it great to see Rondo look helpless against Delonte and completely disappear in that game?  And what happened to the vaunted shooting skills of &quot;Old Sam&quot; when the chips were down?  Many questions, no answers.

All during the regular season, the Celtic broadcasters assured us that there was a playoff atmosphere every time we played in somebody else&#039;s arena.  We were always getting the opposing team&#039;s &quot;best shot&quot; because we had &quot;targets on our back&quot; but we usually managed to win anyway, because we were so damned &quot;intense&quot; (is everybody else sick of that word too?). Seems that was just so much hyperbole, huh?  I guess we better just hope that the Celts never lose at home, because as soon as they head into the enemy camp, they simply collapse.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just don&#039;t get it. Why do they just not show up on the road in the playoffs? I&#039;d say its do or die in Game 4 in Cleveland...because the Cavs could definitely take a game from the Celtics in Boston.]]></description>
