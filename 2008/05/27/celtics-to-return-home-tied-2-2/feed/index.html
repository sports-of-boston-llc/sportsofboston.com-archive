		<description><![CDATA[A pretty sorry display of basketball from the Celts.  If it weren&#039;t for their surprising efficiency from the free throw line, the C&#039;s probably would have lost by 30.  KG&#039;s worst performance of the playoffs, a largely ineffective Paul Pierce, total floundering around from all the Celt guards, and a new low (if that&#039;s possible) for Ray Allen who added to his inability to shoot jumpers by clunking two free throws late in the game.

You&#039;ve got to hope that Eddie House took Doc aside after the game and said something like &quot;Hey, boss, would it really kill you to give me a shot at shooting guard with Rondo on the floor?  I mean, could I be any worse than Ray Allen out there?  I&#039;m sure I could hit one or two shots, which makes me far superior to anyone else at that position.  Huh, boss&quot;?

Let&#039;s hope the home court magic is there again for the Celts.

By the way, does anyone know what that boxlike &quot;thing&quot; is on Garnett&#039;s right hand(the finger thing)?  Looks somewhat lethal - I&#039;m surprised he&#039;s allowed to wear it.  What is it?]]></description>
