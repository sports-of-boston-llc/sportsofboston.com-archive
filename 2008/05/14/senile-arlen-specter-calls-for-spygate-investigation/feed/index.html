		<description><![CDATA[Interesting pont of view about Specter and spygate from Specter&#039;s own back yard. It&#039;s worth it&#039;s &quot;weight in wildcats&quot; (whatever that means) !

SO, LET ME SEE if I have this right. The reason Sen. Arlen Specter refuses to let Spygate die has nothing to do with the Eagles&#039; three-point loss to the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXIX, or that pile of money that the NFL&#039;s archenemy, Comcast, contributed to his last re-election campaign, or the fact that NFL commissioner Roger Goodell won&#039;t get down on bended knee and kiss his senatorial ring or anything else of Specter&#039;s.
No, the real reason Specter won&#039;t let it go is because of little Johnny and all of the little Johnnys in this country, who, even as we speak, are seriously considering bringing cheat sheets with them to their next fourth-grade math quiz.

&quot;People raise a question why [I want to] look into this,&quot; the Pennsylvania Republican said. &quot;Well, the sports leagues, including the NFL, have a very preferred status in our society. They have an antitrust exemption. And that antitrust exemption is worth its weight in wildcats. Without the antitrust exemption, they wouldn&#039;t be able to pool their revenues and control the schedule.

&quot;They are enormous role models for everybody. But if you can cheat in the NFL, you can cheat in college and you can cheat in high school. You can cheat on your grade-school math test. There&#039;s no limit as to what you can do.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ok so correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but isn&#039;t there a war going on? Isn&#039;t our planet dying and oil running out and people dying of preventable starvation and disease? Clearly, the senate has more important things to be doing with their time and money. Someone needs to explain to this moron (who I didn&#039;t like before this crap anyway) that Philly has one of the worst public school systems in the country and perhaps that might be a better place to focus his attention. Stupid.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I want an independent investigation on how stupid the people of Pennsylvania are for electing Specter to the Senate.

Seriously, there are so many more important matters out there to fix. What a joke. 

I think it&#039;s interesting the Specter has basically said Goodell is full of crap and doesn&#039;t have integrity to do a fair investigation.

It feels nice to have the NFL on our side now!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To answer KC&#039;s questions:
Why does everyone outside of New England still care so much about Spygate? 

Three reasons: 
1) Because they are winners. Example, the Yankees spend a lot of money on players and other teams tend to whine about it. Yes, it makes a difference but the Yankees aren&#039;t winning every year because of it. I feel the same about this Spygate scandal.  Yes, the taping probably gave the an advantage but not to the extent of their championship run.  

2) Getting caught and then saying everyone else does it just doesn&#039;t cut it in the real world.  When you cheat on an exam/significant other/etc., there will be trust issues. People will wonder if this was an one time thing or consistent problem in the past. There will also be more eyes on you in the future.

3) NFL destroying the tapes and notes after the investigation. This gives all the conspiracy theorists and the average fan some fuel to add to the flame.


Personally, I think Goodell punished the Pats enough and their legacy has already been tainted. What they did was WRONG but if stealing some football signals is all it takes to win, then WHY aren&#039;t other teams doing it? Arlen is WRONG to open another investigation and waste my tax money for something so trivial.]]></description>
