		<description><![CDATA[Agreed, but Cassel isn&#039;t a young quarterback, the guy has been in the league four years, that makes him what, 26? 

Young in terms of experience, yes. 

The pass rush was abysmal, Rivers didn&#039;t hit the ground ONCE (and that&#039;s more than sacks, he wasn&#039;t even HIT once)]]></description>

What really concerns me is the lack of a swagger or identity on this team. Our pass rush was bad, our linebackers were confused, and our secondary was bombed on numerous occasions. This defense just can&#039;t stop anyone good. I don&#039;t see how they&#039;ll stop the Broncos, even at home...]]></description>
