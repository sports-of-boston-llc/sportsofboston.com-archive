		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s really sad how bad the defense is. Were they really this bad last year when the offense was blowing everyone out of the water? Now that the offense is mediocre, the defense is exposed to be just plain bad.

This team is going nowhere in the playoffs if the defense continues to not have much of a pass rush. With no pass rush, the bad secondary has almost no chance and will most likely get beat deep many times in a game.

The only consolation is that if there&#039;s any year for Brady to get injured, its 2008 due to the ridiculous amount of parody in the NFL. I mean...is Tennessee really the best team? Yikes...]]></description>

That is the funniest thing I&#039;ve read in a long time. I actually laughed out loud when I read that. Awesome. (Except for the fact that it&#039;s true, dammit. :-P)]]></description>
