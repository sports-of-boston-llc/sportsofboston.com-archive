		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re a very greedy fantasy owner to demand more than 7.4 points from all your players. Jones did have two huge weeks...but I wouldn&#039;t consider him a top-10 back at all.

Look at Ladainian Tomlinson: 12 carries, 35 yards...5 catches, 22 yards for a grand total of 5.7 points. I&#039;d say he was expected to perform better than Jones...and he didnt. In fact, I&#039;m sure he hurt many owners out there. He didn&#039;t help or hurt Mike since you demolished him haha]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have to disagree Kenneth. Jones had two amazing games before Week 5 and then only got 7.40 points on Sunday. He was a dud.

As for the trade, I say there was very little risk for Dev. As a Colston woner in another league, I have been keeping up with his status and everyone knew he would be back before season&#039;s end. In fact, he may be back for Week 7. Dev knew this as well and knew he wouldn&#039;t have to wait long for Colston to be back on the field.

Another screwjob!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wouldn&#039;t agree that Julius Jones was necessarily &quot;a dud.&quot; He still got over 6 points, which is close to probably what he normally earns in our scoring system (maybe 10ish).

The trade you&#039;re referring to is the classic quick fix for KJ and the wait-and-see approach for Dev. Colston could be risky only because Brees throws to anyone he wants, and Colston is coming back from injury. Dev definitely has the edge in the trade either way though...]]></description>
