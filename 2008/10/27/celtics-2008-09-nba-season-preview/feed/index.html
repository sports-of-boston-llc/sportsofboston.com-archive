		<description><![CDATA[I wouldnt go so far as having the Hawks beat out the Magic for the division, but I think they have a shot at the 8th seed again. Miami didn&#039;t look that good against the Knicks, but it is only one game. We&#039;ll see.

ps - Josh Smith is a beast!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Haha. Thanks for the love KC.

Unlike many of the &quot;experts,&quot; I too believe my Hawks will be back in the playoffs. They still have the ability to surprise some folks this season with all of the doubters, and I think they will do just that.

They are deeper than they were last season (despite losing Josh Childress to another continent), and I expect a breakout year from Marvin Williams (go ahead and be ready to quote me on that one).

They may even be &quot;good enough&quot; to be the kings of the Southeast, depending on how well Orlando plays (probably not, but it&#039;s a possibility).

The team I don&#039;t see making the playoffs (with the Heat making it) is Washington. They are missing both Arenas and Haywood. I think they will struggle for the first couple of months, and inevitably miss out.]]></description>
