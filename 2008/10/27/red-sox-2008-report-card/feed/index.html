		<description><![CDATA[Dan, great comments.  I do agree on Crisp, I think he played his best ball when it counted most (how awesome was that at-bat against the Rays).  I think I was a bit down on them because the Manny drama took the whole team down for a week or two and Drew carried the team in the first half and then disappeared and was of course hurt, as you noted.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the outfield I&#039;m suprised it&#039;s a B+ with JD Drew being the star. JD only had one good production month in  June. Yes he did carry the team then. The rest of the time though he just used his OBP to stay valuable. Also he only managed 368 AB&#039;s this year.

The best asset in the outfield was our LF&#039;ers who combined had 29 HRs, 105 RBI. Also Bay finished well in the playoffs by hitting .341 with .471 OBP and .634 SLG. While no one here could of counted on Manny to hit .520 in the playoffs like he did for the Dodgers.

Finally, Coco Crisp needs respect. This was his best offensive year in three years in Boston and he did it seamlessly in a back-up role. Not to mention, he hit .417 in the playoffs when and where no else could.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Josh, thanks for the feedback, glad yoy enjoyed it.  At the bottom of the column, I named Lester as the MVP, so you can see my reasoning there.  As for the flop, Mike Timlin maybe, he had a huge dropoff.  Injuries really limited Papi&#039;s production, so he&#039;s a choice as well.  Lugo might qualify, but he did miss half the season (not sure that helps or hurts his case).  What do you think?]]></description>
