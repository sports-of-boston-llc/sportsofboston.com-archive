		<description><![CDATA[He was 6th in the NBA in double-doubles last season with 51 (5 off of second place).  He was one of 4 20 PPG/10RPG players last season (21.1/10.4).  The others were Jamison (21.4/10.2), Jefferson (21.0/11.1), and Howard (20.7/14.2).  Tim Duncan was not a member of this club at 19.3/11.3.  Boozer and Jamison had about .5 Steal/G more than Howard and Jefferson, but have about 1 Block/G fewer.  Howard led the group with .559 FG%, but kills FT% at .590.  Boozer was second in both categories .547/.738; Jefferson was third in each at .500/.721; Jamison was .436/.760 (his FG% is lower because he gives you 3s).  20-10 with good %s is first round material.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think Boozer was a great pick there.  He&#039;s a 20-10 guy who gives you great FG% and is the rare big man that won&#039;t kill your FT% (75ish).

I didn&#039;t want to take Wade, but you&#039;re right on that I couldn&#039;t ignore him there.  At #11, I felt I had to go with the risk/reward thing with all the elite players off the board.]]></description>
