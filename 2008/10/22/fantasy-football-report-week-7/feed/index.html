		<description><![CDATA[Shotgun you make a good case...you still go lucky though. 

And pete - no need to worry about being 3-4. With one more win, you&#039;re in 4th place (where you should be), so it&#039;s not a big deal yet. If you were two games back, then that would be bush league.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would like to state that I would have had more than 74 points if a substitution I attempted would have worked (or if I would have made sure it did at 4 in the morning).

I picked up Mewelde Moore when I heard about Larry Johnson going to be inactive and thought I had put him into the lineup Thursday night. However, I was incorrect and Moore ended up with 3 TDs and 31.4 fantasy points on the bench while I got 0.0 from Johnson.

If I would have lost, I would have been extremely pissed off, but against Jeff and his 2 hurt QBs and 3 bye weeks for players in the starting lineup, it made no difference.
