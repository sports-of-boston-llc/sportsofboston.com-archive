		<description><![CDATA[Yeah. If Josh Beckett is healthy (which it looks like he is) then the Sox can definitely win this in 3. Their top 3 matches or is better than the Angels top 3.

The Angels are just big chokers in the playoffs, none of their pitchers bring confidence to the hill in October. As vulnerable as the Sox are they simply own the Angels in the playoffs.
