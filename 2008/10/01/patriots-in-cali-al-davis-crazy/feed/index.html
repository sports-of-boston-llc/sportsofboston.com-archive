		<description><![CDATA[GreenN Gold. Put the bong down or in GB should I say the 24 pack since you are a bunch of hunting hicks. The Pats are retooling but continue to win the AFC East. Please tell us about the aging team or possibly signing players like Holt for one season until we use our 4 picks in the first two rounds next season, one being a Raiders pick that should be a top 5 if not a #1 Jake Locker trade. Our run was over last year when we knew it wasn&#039;t going to be a SB season. Too bad your legend kicked your ass LY and will probably do it again. I doubt Bob Kraft will kick TB to the curb like Ted T did to your hero. PS Enjoying another one of our team kicking ass!! Celtics baby !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!! Enjoy your cheese. Wisconsin, what a joke.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;As bad as the superbow loss ... &quot; No , that&#039;s where it ends. It&#039;s pointless bringing up a team that&#039;s no good. How sad! Trying to cover that superbowl hangover with a cheap shot to an already bad team. Ha! after what had seem to be a perfect season you guys lost when it matter the most. I&#039;ll take an average 10-6 season even a subpar 9-7 season with a superbowl win, instead of your &quot;beat on my chest 16-0 season&quot; What a waste of perfection... almost perfect! lol
Go Tuck Brady lol lol lol]]></description>
