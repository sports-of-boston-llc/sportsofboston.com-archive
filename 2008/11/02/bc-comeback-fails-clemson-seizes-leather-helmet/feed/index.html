		<description><![CDATA[I like the idea of a trophy game since it&#039;s now an annual game.  We have had all great games since the ACC rivalry began, so that helps as well.  I think it&#039;ll help BC fit into the ACC, having a bona fide rival now.

I think I was too harsh on Texas especially.  USC always loses a conference game for no apparent reason and OSU was it.  Their defense has looked pretty good for the balance of the season.  With no one challenging them in the Pac-10, they should make the BCS.  Unfortunately for the superior Big 12, they won&#039;t get 4 teams in and depending how they beat each other up (TTU-OSU, TTU-UO, championship game, etc), they might only get one team into the BCS.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, I don&#039;t really like the idea of adding a trophy to a series that has played only 18 times in 60+ years. What&#039;s your opinion?

And there&#039;s no way a team that lost to a previously hapless Oregon State (note their thorough dismantling by Penn State) should rank above teams whose only loss are to teams that are still ranked in the Top 10.

It might be different if USC had actually looked really good against any team not from Washington (who are absolutely terrible) or Ohio.]]></description>
