		<description><![CDATA[KC (and others), what do you think now that the 2009 season is over? Would you bring Tek back? Or, at what cost? Surely, the V-Mart deal changed things as he wasn&#039;t even in the mix last winter. I stick to my guns, that his age/wear and tear has ended the productive phase of his career. I think V-Mart will spend more time at 1B eventually, so he certainly isn&#039;t the long term answer (even if he stays beyond this season).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think a two-year deal is suitable for Tek. I&#039;ve never been divorced (or married for that matter) so I can&#039;t say that he wasn&#039;t affected.

Now he&#039;s single, can get any girl he wants, and he&#039;s going to hit better. He has to, right?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keep the Captain here for at least one more year.  A lot of his offensive problems can probably be tied to the major distraction of going through a divorce.  Cannot minimize the impact that must have had.  It would be a shame to go to camp with who we have right now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[let&#039;s not forget that a big reason for varitek&#039;s drop in offensive numbers came after Magadan changed his batting stance because he thought JV was too twitchy at the plate. After Tek went back to his old double tapping standard he started to hit better again. That said I think boras is spending so much time knuckling teams under for big contracts that having him represent you is starting to become a liability. Varitek should come back to the sox!]]></description>
