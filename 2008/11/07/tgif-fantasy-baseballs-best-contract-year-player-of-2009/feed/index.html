		<description><![CDATA[With all due respect sir, I wrote this piece back in November which was long before Beltre was connected to steroids.

If he was clean, then I would still stand by my statment that he would be an excellent pick for the 2009 season. In fact, I think the Mariners&#039; offense is going to surprise a lot of people this season.

If it turns out that he did that well in 2004 because of steroids or other performance enhancers and not because it was a contract year like I have theorized, then he will not be an offensive powerhouse this year as I have predicted.]]></description>
