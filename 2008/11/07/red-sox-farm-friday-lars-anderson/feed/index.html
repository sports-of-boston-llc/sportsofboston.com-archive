		<description><![CDATA[I foresee the Sox keeping Anderson in Pawtucket for all of 2009, and moving Youkilis to 3B (Youk showed he can still handle third quite capably this post-season) to make room for Lars in 2010. 

His is an interesting story, to be sure. It&#039;s very rare for any player demanding $1 million+ to see that type of bonus outside of the top 3 rounds, and for it to happen in the 18th is almost unheard of. Its has obviously worked out quite well for the Sox thus far.]]></description>
