		<description><![CDATA[I have to give the Hawks credit...but it&#039;s not like i didn&#039;t see this coming. Shotgun and I were one of the 10 people on Earth that had the Hawks making the playoffs this year. 

Well..I will admit that I didn&#039;t see a 6-0 start coming though...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What an incredible game! Even though my Hawks got up early, I knew Boston would make a run (everyone makes a run in the NBA).

And then even when Marvin hit the three to give the Hawks the lead, I knew either Pierce or Garnett was going to have the chance for at least one more shot. The Hawks defended Pierce well enough with Joe Johnson switching with Al Horford, but Pierce just hit a hell of a shot.

Can&#039;t complain too much about losing to a good team on a great game-winner.

And I believe I mentioned before that Marvin Williams was going to have a breakout year this season. Thus far, (from the last I saw) he is leading the NBA in 3-point percentage.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What a game and what a finish. This game reminded me a lot of the game KC and I went to last year where the Raptors were something like 15-23 from 3 and beat us. I haven&#039;t been watching a ton of Celtics yet this year, haven&#039;t gotten into it yet, but  man I was on the edge of my seat for the fourth and exploded when he hit that shot.]]></description>
