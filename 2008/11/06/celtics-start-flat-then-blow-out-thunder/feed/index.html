		<description><![CDATA[Does ANYONE have any idea why NBA League Pass has blacked out EVERY Celtics game so far?  I get the national games being blacked out but I live in Albany, NY and the Celtics are not my home market.  I paid $150 to watch the C&#039;s and so far it&#039;s been money wasted!  When I called Time Warner Cable I was told it was because the game was on NESN and they didn&#039;t have a contract with them.  First, we know it is Comcast and not NESN for the C&#039;s.  Second, if they don&#039;t have an agreement with Comcast then we won&#039;t be able to watch ANY Celtics games this year and I want a refund!]]></description>
