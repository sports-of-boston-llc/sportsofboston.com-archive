		<description><![CDATA[Here are my East\West first team All Star picks. Forwards for West are Devin Setoguchi, Jarome Iginla, and Patrick Marleau. Defenseman are Dan Boyle and Patrick Kane. Goaltender Niklas Backstrom. East would be Marc Savard, Evgeni Malkin, and Simon Gagne. Defense would be Zdeno Chara, and Andrei Markov. Goaltender Tim &quot;frickin&quot; Thomas. Now I call that a fair pecking order. It is so sad when people vote for players because of popularity and the region where the game is being held. I based my picks on all criteria combined. for forwards and defensemen, I went by goals assists +\- and least time in the box. And for goalies, it was all stats combined and who remained closest to the top of all statistical categories of wins, GAA, saves% and shutouts. I think I got them all pretty much right. I am not bias but yes, I am from Boston.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[...] Quite the performance from the goaltenders this week, as Tim Thomas and Manny Fernandez both posted strong showings in their respective outings. Thomas recorded a .958 save percentage in his games, stopping 69/72 shots in wins against Toronto and Dallas. Fernandez turned away 32 of 33 shots in a victory over the Buffalo Sabres last night, for a .970 save percentage. Not bad for two guys not on the All-Star ballot. [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tim Thomas has been underrated for far too long. So underrated, that Bruins management thought they needed Manny Fernandez before last season.

I thought Thomas being underrated was over when he was named to the All-star team last year...but I guess it continues once again.]]></description>
