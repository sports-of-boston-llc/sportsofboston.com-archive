		<description><![CDATA[What I don&#039;t get is why are the Jets one of the premiere teams in the AFC now? If we came back and beat them last Thursday...are they now worse team? A dominating victory over the Pats would have me convinced the Jets were the real deal...but I don&#039;t see it. If they hang tough against the Titans and somehow win, that would also help convince me.

As for the Pats/Dolphins, I always like the Patriots the second time around against an opponent. There&#039;s no way Ronnie Brown&#039;s rushing for four touchdowns again, but he can be awfully hard to stop.

Patriots 27, Dolphins 24]]></description>
