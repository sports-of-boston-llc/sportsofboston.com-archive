		<description><![CDATA[I broke the record with 170.08 but I forgot to set my lineups for Thursday and missed Kellen Winslow&#039;s day (111 yards, 2 TDs). 

Winslow would have brought the total to  191.18.

Not an acceptable mistake with the playoffs around the corner.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I now officially hate Larry Johnson. Not only did he suck in all but one game to begin this year, but then he loses his ability not to hit and spit on women, thus forcing me to search for scrap heap RBs during bye weeks.

And now he comes back, and he&#039;ll probably have like 312 yards and 7 TDs or something ridiculous this week.

So F*** you Larry!]]></description>
