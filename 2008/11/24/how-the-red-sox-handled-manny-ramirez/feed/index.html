		<description><![CDATA[Now that the marriage is over There shouldnt be bitter feelings  and awful things said all the time about Manny.He left his own legacy and will always be a part of redsox from what he contributed the two rings.The organization should not complain or bring up stories all the time to try and show the world the bad side of Manny.He did a splendid job in LA and am sure if Manny were still a redsox we would be having another ring.So lets zip it especially those collegues that have run their mouths about Manny.Please we have heard enough try and focus on 2009 and bring the best of your bat.Gongraculation to Pedroia he tried so much to carry the team across.We need more of those characters in our team.And to the organization or the management please try and show some love to your out going players because we dont know about the future.To all baseball players leave a good name when it is time to leave.GO SOS 2009!]]></description>
