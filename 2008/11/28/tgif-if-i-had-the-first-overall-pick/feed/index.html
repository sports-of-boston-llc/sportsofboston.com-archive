		<description><![CDATA[the thing about pujols is his elbow, its been said that surgery is inevitable, so its only a matter of time. He played through the whole of 2008 with discomfort, so the surgery may happen sooner than later.

Arod might definitely be worth the pick given that his worst seasons happen to be 35-36 hrs and 100odd rbi]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You see, you can&#039;t draft the first overall pick based on a &quot;probable&quot; outcome. You need a borderline guarantee.

Pujols is close to it but, I have a thing for Hanley. Picking Pujols or Hanley is strictly based on preference.

Hanley had that 2008 season while battling a shoulder problem. He had surgery after the 2007 season to repair his shoulder and a lot of people put his production in doubt. Well, he just had the biggest power year of his young career in 2008.

Just imagine him at 100% coming into the 2009 season.

I&#039;m going to need the first pick in your league KC.]]></description>
