		<description><![CDATA[I think the Steelers are a very strong team...but you have to admit if Randy Moss catches that touchdown at the end of the first half, and the Pats go into halftime up 17-10, the game is TOTALLY different.

Also take into account that the Steelers had nothing to do with the critical play of the game: Matthew Slater&#039;s fumble on the kickoff following a Steelers go ahead field goal. The Steelers struck for a touchdown and went up 20-10. Game over.

I&#039;ll give James Harrison credit for manhandling Matt Light, tho Light did a horrible job of blocking on both sacks. And to back up my point...the Steelers only converted both turnovers into three points.

As far as the turnovers, I&#039;ll give the Steelers credit for three of the five...one of Cassel&#039;s INT&#039;s was tipped and the Slater fumble was certainly weather-related.

Hey, the Steelers did outplay the Patriots, but really not until the wheels fell off the NE bus in the third quarter...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This article is giving way to much credit to the Patriots and the weather.  The Patriots didn&#039;t shoot themselves in the foot; they got punched in the mouth by an outstanding defensive line who revealed them to be what they are....average at best.  It wasn&#039;t the weather that disrupted Randy Moss&#039;s game, it was the fear of being de-cleated and knocked unconscious by the Steel Curtain of the new millennium.  Don&#039;t sugar-coat the loss KC, tell it like it is.  The Pats were overmatched, outplayed, and outcoached.]]></description>
