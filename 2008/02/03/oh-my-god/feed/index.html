		<description><![CDATA[The offensive line was totally outplayed all game long. I dont think I&#039;ve ever seen a QB take so many hard hits...playing that poorly how did the Pats even have a lead with 2:35 to go? Hats off to the Giants...they just played better when it mattered.

Oh, and Eli should not have been the MVP. Any of the defensive linemen or Tyree would be better choices.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The offensive line was solid but the Giants defensive line was just more hungry.

Also Belichick was pretty much outcoached (gasp!) by Coughlin.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gentlemen, as a Giants fan, I am truly honored to have beaten a team like  the Patriots.

I also believe if you guys played us 100 times, you would probably win 99 of those times....

Just not today.

Congrats on a historic season.]]></description>
