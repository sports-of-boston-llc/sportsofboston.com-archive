		<description><![CDATA[Yea I think the Suns were just stuck at 55 wins and out in the second or third round. While the basketball is exciting, the goal is to win a title. If Shaq is healthy that can happen! (unless the Suns are facing the Celtics)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[KC- Thanks for the comments. The further away from it i get, the more i can see some reasons behind the trade that make some sense. As the radio guys here have said, if nothing else this makes the Suns relevant again. There has been a malaise about the team this season, and this will fix that. It will be interesting to see what happens...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Haha ok I stand corrected. That was an absolutely amazing block. He sucks otherwise, but that block was the best I&#039;ve ever ever seen.

Marion was jealous of Stoudemire and sick of being the &quot;third wheel.&quot;

I forgot to mention that Steve Kerr is the rookie-GM for the Suns, so maybe the move isn&#039;t so good...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The trade kinda makes sense because the Suns really weren&#039;t going to do anything without a true center, but is Shaq really a true center anymore? I&#039;m not sure.

I&#039;m not sure either why Sean Marion wanted out of Phoenix so bad?

I think the Heat are going to still struggle to make the playoffs because they&#039;ll have to live with Udonnis Haslem at center and Dwayne Wade&#039;s shoulder still isn&#039;t 100% IMHO.

Oh, and Marcus Banks was an &quot;awful&quot; celtic. Sure, he didn&#039;t live up to the first round pick status, but his block against Phoenix on Stoudamire a few years ago I believe is the best block I&#039;ve ever seen.]]></description>
