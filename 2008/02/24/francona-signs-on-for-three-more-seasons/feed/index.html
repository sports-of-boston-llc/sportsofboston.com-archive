		<description><![CDATA[I think the Red Sox made a great move here. Its about time they got this deal done. This morning on WEEI&#039;s  Dale &#038; Holley, they also expressed their appriciation towards the Red Sox organization in signing Tito. Later in the show, they had Tito LIVE on air to talk about the Sox workouts and his extension. His contract is though 2011 with a club option for 2012-2013. He&#039;s said to make between $3-$3.5 Mil. Tito&#039;s happy to have this over with and excited to be here for the long run.  Side Note: Bruce Hurst is now part of the Sox Organization once again as a Player Developmental Insructor.]]></description>
