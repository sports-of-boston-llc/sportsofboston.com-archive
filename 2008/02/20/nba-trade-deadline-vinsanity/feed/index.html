		<description><![CDATA[No offense, I don&#039;t like anything the Knicks are doing. They might as well get Vince Carter, he&#039;s way better than Eddy Curry. They paid Anucha Browne-Sanders like $50 million in that sexual harassment lawsuit, maybe they could&#039;ve used that money in buying out Marbury and Curry.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nooo Keep Vince carter out of New York. I was actually starting to like the Knicks with Zach Randolph and Jamal Crawford. 

Best move they could do would be to move Eddy Curry and put in David Lee. 

Second best move throw Stephon Marbury into the East River and let him wash up on some other coast. 

New York would be better without Curry and Marbury.]]></description>
