		<description><![CDATA[Yea I agree. I think they had their minds made up before the hearings. There was one guy who said basically that McNamee is a liar and has trouble believing anything out of his mouth. The one thing I can&#039;t believe is that the hearings are still going on!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This morning/afternoon on WEEI&#039;s Dale and Holley they went back and fourth talking about the hearing on capitol hill. Once the hearing got started they listened in on Clemens licking his chops and McNamee pissing himself. Dale and Holley seem to not know what side they believe. They kept critisizing on how they were asked questions from each of the US Reps from around the nation. Holley thinks that certain US Reps have already made up thier minds on who is telling the truth and who isnt. Cummings, one of the US Reps, seems to be on McNamee side, by way of how he was persisting in asking Clemens, &quot;You do know that you are under oath correct?&quot;. Dale and Holley have just been sitting bac k and listening to the hearing all afternoon and have said little on the topic as they only have 1 minute of speaking until a commercail must play on air. When they do have time to speak they have been saying how dumb Senators questions have been.]]></description>
