		<description><![CDATA[Can&#039;t agree with you. Yesterday, Clemens looked like a rat racing to leave a sinking boat. He look untruthful and was ready to throw under the bus, anyone he could to protect his image. No one, in his right mind, could believed the story about his mother and the B-12 nor that Clemens had answers about the testimony of Pettite.  McNamme is certainly not the best witness ( and he lied as Clemens did ) but his story is confirmed by Pettite and Knockblock. Clemens wanted to be heard by the commitee to clean his name but, at the end of the day, it was Roger against the world. What i saw, yesterday, was a guy who cared more about his EGO then his own wife. Totally pathetic !!!]]></description>
