		<description><![CDATA[Living in Maryland I consider myself neutral. I can tell you there is no way of receiving a fair game against a NY team. Media based in NY. Announcers NY.
Bad officiating ruined the game. Intentional grounding was a 9 pt turn that should have never been called. A bad call when the receiver was clearly out of bounds and then the clock tampering. Always thought football was fixed. Now its apparent.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What about the NE/PIT game that an extra 52 seconds were added to the game in the 4th quarter?  The Pats marched down the field to kick a gw field goal.  Brady had 1:21 left to work with when he should have only had 29 seconds.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well said, Jeff. Patriot fans have even written a protest about this issue to Roger Goodell. Your post emphasizes the falacy of this viewpoint. It is amazing how many Patriot fans can be such poor losers. They couldn&#039;t find any PI calls to complain about, so they had to drum up one officiating call to contest. Why don&#039;t they just focus on the missed INT on the previous play. Joe Buck is just a poor football announcer - he really doesn&#039;t understand the game, but runs his mouth like a beer swilling fan.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There was no problem with the clock, this video has been debunked. Peter King wrote an article in SI basically saying the fan doesn&#039;t know what hes talking about. The clock stops there on 4th down if there is even a possibility of a measurement, even if the measurement is simply an eyeball measurement by the official. It was an officials timeout. There was also a conference to add 6 seconds which unjustly ran off. After the short conference Carey waited for the officials to get back into their positions before he wound the clock (which is standard in the nfl), the Giants as you would expect were already in position to run the next play, as they were in the hurry up

Even if the officials did not stop the clock there (which they should have done by NFL rule), the Giants would not have allowed 35 or more seconds to elapse without running a play, they were in their hurry up offense and had all 3 timeouts. They scored the game winner with 35 seconds left, so if anything it would have only give the Pats LESS time at the end on their final drive]]></description>
