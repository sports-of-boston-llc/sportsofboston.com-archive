		<description><![CDATA[I am a huge female Boston sports fan (make that huge sports fan, average-sized female).  The pink hat/shirt/shoes phenomenon is a bit of an embarrassment to real fans, especially this female one.  It&#039;s sort of a mockery of the real uniforms, like they aren&#039;t fashion worthy enough.  I&#039;m all for a feminine-tailored version of the real thing to assist with fit...my Brady jersey is a Mens and hangs down to my knees on game days. 

In regards to Jennifer loving sports, but picking and choosing which ones she follows or understands on the Boston scene, you have to comprehend that it&#039;s one big sports scene.  For example, I&#039;m guessing you weren&#039;t tuned in for the Celtics game last night...so therefore you missed the Ty Law interview and a crucial piece of breaking news that could have implications to bringing #24 back to New England, and my favorite bobblehead out of mothballs and back on top of the cable box.

Pink hats, like Bud Lite drinkers, and those with artificial Christmas trees, are the great pretenders!]]></description>

You have such a valid point. I know that many real sports fans question the integrity of the pink hat. Even though I wear one, I sometimes catch myself judging other girls. You can definitely expect more thoughts on this subject.

Thank you so much for your comments!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re right KC there are many men and women who fit the &quot;pink hat&quot; mold.

I was just stating that because of the connotations that go along with wearing the actual pink hat a real fan looks less credible than if they were wearing the true Sox colors‚Ä¶. what can I say I‚Äôm a purist. Unfortunately just the mention of the pink hat makes me think of a girl hooked on her boyfriend‚Äôs arm reapplying her lipstick while she should be throwing back beers and screaming along with Sweet Caroline. 

However, I do love the addition of a woman on staff so I like Jen with or without pink hat.

And to Dave...I can assure you I am a true fan however I&#039;m not quite ready to have my picture floating around on the internet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for that clarification KC. It&#039;s not surprising that your definition accidentally got changed a bit in the game of telephone between you, Dev, and myself. I just wanted to make sure you got the credit for it in case any girls are horribly offended by it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just for the record, I&#039;m not trying to label all people who have pink hats as non-fans. Perhaps an unfair label, the &quot;pink-hat&quot; applies to all people who are Red Sox fans of convenience (i.e. when they&#039;re in Boston for college or jobs or when the team is doing really well). If the team sucks, they don&#039;t care.

Pink also has a female connotation, but there are certainly some guys who perfectly fit the &quot;pink hat&quot; mold.

And...welcome aboard Jenn.]]></description>
