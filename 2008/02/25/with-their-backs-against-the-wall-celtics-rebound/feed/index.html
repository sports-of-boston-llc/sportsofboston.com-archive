		<description><![CDATA[Waterboy - I totally agree. The Celtics have looked so flat in the last four games, going 1-3 with KG. Their first real test will be a date with the revamped Cavs on Wednesday. Looking ahead to that next West Coast Trip, I expect the Celtics to go at least 2-2 against the four best teams in the Western Conference. I mean, they swept the Lakers, but that was pre-Gasol trade. It should be interesting down the stretch.

Dev - awesome!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This was just test #1 for the Celtics this year. A west coast swing, without KG to his fullest. Weird to say thta the C&#039;s were 7-2 without KG, but 1-3 with him back in the line up. Need i say, Sit KG and start Leon Powe?! haha. The next test will be 3rd week in march when we have another Western Conf. road trip with the Spurs, Rockets, Mavs and Hornets. If we are going to contend, we need to step it up and play like we did for the first month and a 1/2 of the season.]]></description>
