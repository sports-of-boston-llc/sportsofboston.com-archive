CAREER #&#039;s: 71.2 IP, 6.15 ERA, 1.67 WHIP.

He hasn&#039;t even shown a flash of brilliance at the major league level. If the man ever had a decent ERA over the span of even just half a season then I would shut my mouth. As things stand, Hansen has yet to prove me wrong.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Come on, it&#039;s not like we lost offensive production. Bay and Manny are putting up similar numbers this season. So now we get Bay for this season and next season (at only around 7.5 million). 

Only time will tell if giving up Brandon Moss will hurt us.

Craig Hansen is gone and thank you God for that. 

The only thing we can point at as a problem is that we didnt get a relief pitcher in the deal somewhere. Oh well, that what waivers are for. Anybody is better than Hansen.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t believe the Sox had to give up Manny, Moss (who I like but we have no use for now), and Hansen (hopefully a change of scenery helps him), AND $7M to get Bay...that looks lopsided.  Quite a deal for the Dodgers: Manny (free) for LaRoche and Morris???]]></description>
