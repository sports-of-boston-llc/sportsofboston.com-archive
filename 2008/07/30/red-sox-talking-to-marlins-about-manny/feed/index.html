		<description><![CDATA[Manny doesn&#039;t want to be here and management has had enough. Clearly the two can&#039;t coexist for another two months. 

I say trade him. 

The Yankees are making moves and trying to get better. If we just sit here with our thumb up our butt and sit back and watch the Yankees pass us and watch the Rays get Bay, then we deserve to lose.

Hell, if anybody wants a prospect, then give them Craig Hansen. He sucks.

ERA with RISP: 13.97. 

He can&#039;t pitch in the majors. Period.]]></description>
