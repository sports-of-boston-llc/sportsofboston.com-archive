		<description><![CDATA[The Tigers organization must have lost their mind. Pudge was the best think to ever happen to the Tigers. He still has alot to offer and can play for several more years. Pudge will will be so missed and are still loved. I will still follow your career and root for you always. I hope you have the best year ever and show how wrong the Tigers are. Brandon Inge Ha Ha. Good 3rd baseman not a catcher. Love you always Pudge. Karen]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In 2005, Bay signed a 4 year deal worth $18.25 million

Yes, how could we possibly eat up Bay&#039;s HUGE 2008 salary of $5.75 million. Not to mention the horror of having to pay him $7.5 million in 2009 (his contract year).

Oh and it&#039;s not complaining, it&#039;s just the facts. When Lugo went down we didn&#039;t go shopping for a brand new SS. Instead we just called up a great prospect in Jed Lowrie.

The Yankees can&#039;t call any great prospects up because they don&#039;t have any. What minor league catcher would you have called up anyway? Francisco Cervelli? A career .272 hitter? 

With such a low level of talent in thier minor league system, they had to go out and buy a new catcher.

In the end it won&#039;t amount to anything. I am pushing all my chips in when I say that the New York Yankees will not win a World Series championship in 2008.]]></description>

The Red Sox are willing to eat Manny&#039;s salary AND get Jason Bay&#039;s contract.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hate how the yankees can really just go out and get who they want only because they have the money to eat a player&#039;s contract. 

Pudge is hitting .295,5HR,32RBI. Those are bad numbers for a fantasy team. The fact that he is a catcher is what makes him valuable and that&#039;s it. He is droppable if he played any other position. For God&#039;s sake, the man has walked only 19 times this season.]]></description>
