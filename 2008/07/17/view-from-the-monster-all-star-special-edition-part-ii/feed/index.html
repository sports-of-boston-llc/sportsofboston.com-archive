		<description><![CDATA[Middle relief is definitely the only pressing concern for this team. And even that could be resolved internally.

Ellsbury has only been allowed to run as much as he is because he creates more runs then loses. According to Money Ball and stat heads, if you can steal above 75% you create runs. Ellsbury’s at 83% so you have to let him run.

Youkilis I have NO hope for. For the past four years he&#039;s been a second half bust. Youk was .328/.414/.502 at the break last year, and then he was .238/.356/.391 after. Inevitably he&#039;ll bust again. He&#039;s one player who runs out of energy too early every year.]]></description>
