		<description><![CDATA[Not surprised, always thought he would go to LA, but I didn&#039;t see the Celts giving him a fourth year (could this be similar to the Sox not wanting to give Pedro long term?). Posey is no Pedro, but at 6 mil a year for a team already over the luxury tax, I don&#039;t know.

Maybe this signifies Ainge still looking toward the future. With Scal&#039;s contract (I think $5 mil a year) coming up as well the Celts should be able to pull in some decent free agents for their bench. 

Of course he&#039;s just a rookie but many scouts I&#039;ve read say Giddens can be a dynamic defender, perhaps Ainge and co. felt he or TA if they bring him back will step in and help out.

No doubt they lose a presence on and off the court, but let&#039;s remember that Pose has only been here one year and already has his titles, you can&#039;t blame him for wanting the cash (and a chance to play with Chris Paul).]]></description>
