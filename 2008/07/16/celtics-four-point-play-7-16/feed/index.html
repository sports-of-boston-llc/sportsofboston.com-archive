		<description><![CDATA[Posey deserves it and New Orleans is a perfect fit.

Anyways, if the Celtics made his deal 4 years, that would last longer than both Pierce&#039;s and Allen&#039;s contracts. He&#039;d be here even after the Big 3 start losing it.

For New Orleans he gets to help them during there prime years. He&#039;ll gel up the team with his personality, and unite it.]]></description>
