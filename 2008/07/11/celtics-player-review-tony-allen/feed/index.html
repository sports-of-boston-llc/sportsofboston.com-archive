		<description><![CDATA[Tony Allen is a better player than he showed last season, he was still in the recovery mode and I&#039;m sure he will be a much better player next year and could be a starter on some other team.
Allen while not a good enough perimeter shooter he&#039;s an excellent penetrator and is a good passer and a good offensive rebounder. Everyone knows he plays good one on one defense but he plays very good team defense. Personally I would like Ray Allen to spend time with Tony so he could improve his outside shooting, if Tony had a decent outside shot he would be a very good player on anyone&#039;s team.
I would like the C&#039;s to keep him and I feel he will make them glad they kept him, the guy can play and will be a very good investment for them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The C&#039;s need to sign James Posey and Tony Allen.  I know I know it&#039;s some cash, but still, step up to the plate, pay them their due and let&#039;s get on with winning banner #18.  I want to be the thorn in Kobe&#039;s side that forces him to not get another ring...you know, not get one withoout Shaq...hahahaha!!!
