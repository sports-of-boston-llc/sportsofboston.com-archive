		<description><![CDATA[This is an interesting pickup. The guy certainly has been a disappointment so far, and looking at Youtube highlights of him, looks like he still has some growing to do within his own body (looks a little uncoordinated).

However, this is a very low risk, high reward pick. He will make the minimum, and on Mohegan Sun Sports Tonight I believe they said O&#039;Bryant is the only (or is one of two) first round pick from 2006 whose option was not picked up. 

If he can be a servicable backup to Perk it would be a huge steal as we don&#039;t have to rely on guys like Candy Man and Scott Pollard.]]></description>
