		<description><![CDATA[Such a heartbreaking loss. Our league back then had teams play in Week 17 during the championship week...I recall benching Philip Rivers because the Chargers were 13-2 and literally had nothing to play for but pride...so Marty Schottenheimer sent out the boys for the whole game OF COURSE.

I should&#039;ve remembered that Andy Reid coached the Eagles, because he&#039;s a king at screwing me in fantasy. That day, Jeff Garcia was facing a mediocre 7-8 Atlanta Falcons. He was in the same situation as Rivers, but I thought had a better chance of playing the whole time because Garcia was just a fill-in for Donovan McNabb that year, so he only played part of the season and would be in mid-season form during the playoffs. Nope, I was totally wrong and will never forgive myself until I win a football league.]]></description>
