		<description><![CDATA[Every deal is a bad one when it comes to making a run this year.

Manny is the best option for a big bat in this lineup if we plan to go for a World Series.

If this was the off-season and we had one year left of Manny, then Bay or Conor Jackson would have the most value and might have a chance to acclimate themselves.

But to toss a player in Boston in the middle of a possible championship run, you better know he can perform here.

If its an absolute must to get rid of him: Best option- Jason Bay, Second-Best Option- Pat Burrell.

Even though Burrell would be a bad option, because come playoff time a good pitcher can dominate Burrell. Manny, Bay, and even Conor Jackson stand a better chance against a smart pitcher.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How about Texeira?  For the Braves, $20M is probably too steep, so it&#039;ll be swapping one free agent for another I suppose, but if the Sox choose, they could decline Manny&#039;s option and use the money to make a run at Texeira.  He&#039;s got the production like Manny and is younger.  I suppose Youk would have to move to the OF to accommodate Tex at 1B.  Realistic?]]></description>
