		<description><![CDATA[I completely agree with Jennifer.  There is a big difference between being a Red Sox fan and being a baseball fan.  Baseball fans recognize that the point of this post is completely dead on.  Red Sox fans would say F-that Pedroier (Rem-dawgs pronunciation) is the man and should start the game.

		<description><![CDATA[I definitely agree that if this is a fan&#039;s game, that this game also shouldn&#039;t count. But they made it count because it became a joke where the players just hung out instead of tried. All of these All-Star or Pro Bowl games are very tricky because either it doesn&#039;t count and it&#039;s a joke to the players or it does count and players could risk injury in a game that should be a celebration of the season. It&#039;s a very fine line you tread.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The fans never get it wrong.  The All-Star game is the FAN&#039;s game!  They get to choose who they want to see which is not always who is the best.  Does Kinsler deserve it, I would say so, but the fans chose Pedroia.  Teams from Boston, New York, Chicago, LA, etc will always have the advantage over smaller markets like Dallas, Tampa, Minnesota, and KC.  I&#039;m sure part of it has to do with the Red Sox success as well as more people see Pedroia than Kinsler.  I hate that MLB made the ASG &quot;count&quot; since it is the fan&#039;s game and they should vote for who they want.  They should also get one rep per team since everyone wants to see a home team player.  BUT, with it counting, should fans be trusted to put the best players out there?  Should a bad team get to have a player?  Take those away too!  The fans will never put the top 9 players out that, but that&#039;s their choice.  I say it&#039;s fine!]]></description>
