		<description><![CDATA[[...] Jocoby Ellsbury is the starting CF and Coco Crisp is pissed. Why? He thought he defense earned him that. Too bad Coco has to bat too. Coco will be moved in before the trade deadline thats for sure. In the meantime it would help everyone if he stopped complaining and platooned with Ellsbury in the meantime. Until Coco is gone Ellsbury is only a part time player and not worth running out there every day unless you know he&#8217;s starting. After the Coco is traded though, Ellsbury will be a great guy to own. ADVICE:Skip on Ellsbury in the draft. And give it a month into the season for Ellsburys value to drop After he only plays half the games and shows his power isn&#8217;t what it was in 2007, its a great time to jump on him. Expect 99 R, 8 HR, 65 RBI, 35 SBs and a .310 avg. For another insight on Jacoby see AL East Fantasy Preview: Boston Red Sox [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[JD Drew has more upside than any Sox player. If the rookies have draft day targets all over them. JD Drew has a don&#039;t touch with your ten foot... stick mark.

So JD is Mr. Value here.]]></description>

That trade, although controversial, was great for the Sox...the Marlins won&#039;t end up keeping Hanley Ramirez anyway]]></description>
