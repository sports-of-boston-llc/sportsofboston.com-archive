		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s an end of an era.  I&#039;m glad to see Favre walk away from the game on his own.  I was afraid that he would only retire after a career-ending injury.  While Favre made his fair share of stupid mistakes, I&#039;m sure everyone would love to have a quarterback like him on their team.  

In other news, I have no idea who I&#039;m going to draft at QB in fantasy football!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ditto Jeff
I have always been amazed at the free pass this guy got from the media although his likeability is probably the reason why.
No longer will I have to watch a Packers game and hear BFs name repeated adnausium.
Goodbye Brett Favre, Brett Favre, Brett Favre........!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hate Brett Favre. Most overrated QB of the era in my mind. He loved the game yes and his consecutive games played streak is impressive, but he&#039;s not in the top 5 QBs of all time. The guy won just one Super Bowl and only made it there a couple times. Everyone loves him because he&#039;s a gunslinger or what have you but he single handedly blew the game against the Giants in the playoffs and pretty much got a free pass in the media. Siyonara.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hope you&#039;re right &#038; he does come back. Ending his career with an interception is no way for a legend to go out. I said all last season that I wanted a Pats/Packers Super Bowl re-match. I still want it and I want Favre to be there. I&#039;ve always resenting the Packers for beating us, but there&#039;s no denying that Brett is amazing and he shouldn&#039;t go out like this.]]></description>
