		<description><![CDATA[This was a GREAT book.  It does not sugar-coat Bonds instead it challenges the beliefs/charges. It gives very clear and obvious flaws to the &quot;evidence&quot; and &quot;belief&quot; that Bonds cheated.  We will not know if he cheated until he admits it.  The trial will not bear out whether he actually cheated.  Read this book and open your eyes to the possibility that we witnessed one of the most amazing athletes that every played the hardest game every invented.  Under no circumstances should any man, woman or child be &quot;convicted&quot; just because they are the biggest jerks on the planet.  Ted fell into that category and he was not nearly as revered as he should have been.  Unfortunately, once the bell has been rung...it cannot be UNrung.]]></description>
