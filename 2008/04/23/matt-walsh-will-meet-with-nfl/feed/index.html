		<description><![CDATA[I would be shocked if Walsh has any evidence that Belichick authorized taping of the Rams. Not because I would put Belichick above doing it but because of Belichicks adament denials of it.
Belichick has stated &quot;I have never taped a practice, certainly not that one,&quot; . We all know that Belichick keeps his cards and comments close to his vest and as far as I know he has not lied about the Spygate scandal to the league or the media. If he did authorize the taping and there was any chance of evidence then I highly doubt he would have commented on the matter. That being said, if he did, than he should be fired.
But, lets remember that this whole matter of taping the Rams was a story reported by the Herald quoting one unnamed source the day before the Superbowl. As far as I know that source has not been named as Walsh nor has Walsh claimed that he was the source. The whole Rams taping rumor and whatever Walsh may have could be totally unrelated.
My guess (and hope) is that Walsh has nothing any more damaging than what has already been given to Goodell. He is just a washed up jock wanabee looking for fifteen minutes of fame.]]></description>
