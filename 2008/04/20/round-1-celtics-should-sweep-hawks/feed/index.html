		<description><![CDATA[Donnie, relax. It&#039;s called a prediction not a sure-thing. Myself and KC both have written about the Celtics expecting them to sweep as have a lot of people. You have to admit the Hawks were incredible underdogs going into this series since they only managed to win 37 games and Celtics lead the league with 66 wins. Who wouldn&#039;t think there would be a sweep? Instead the series has gotten a lot more interesting and there&#039;s a game seven. Don&#039;t call KC a moron for making the prediction where he even gave the Hawks a game. A lot of people made that prediction and we&#039;re not morons.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Before the series, there&#039;s no way you could say the Hawks would force a Game 7. I gave them a lot of credit for winning one game. 

I said the Celts &quot;should sweep&quot; but instead I said &quot;PREDICTION: Celtics 4, Hawks 1.&quot; I&#039;m wrong, but I didn&#039;t think the Celts would flatten the Hawks. I thought it might be competitive.]]></description>
