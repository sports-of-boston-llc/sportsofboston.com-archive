		<description><![CDATA[How can I blame it on the officials? Did you see the technicals called on Pachulia? He should have been tossed from the game and the fact that the referees didn&#039;t see it to begin with and HAD to watch a replay is disgusting. The other night Horford gets away with taunting Pierce after he gets a shot in. Not just taunting he was in his face and pointing and nothing happens. Paul Pierce makes a little gesture that really meant nothing according to him and he loses $25,000. Seems a lot like some bad calls to me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was at the game Monday night. What an awesome outcome. Why is it whenever a team is performing bad you blame it on the officials? Atlanta had 22 Personal Fouls while Boston had 24. Seems pretty even to me. 

If you look at the starting 5 of Atlanta they match up very well against Boston. It&#039;s not until you go to the bench does Atlanta have problems.

Kudos to Atlanta!]]></description>
