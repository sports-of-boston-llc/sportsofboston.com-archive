		<description><![CDATA[PP is a Piru Blood.  He used to claim it when he was a rookie in the NBA, and just before that.

Ummm....wake up ppl.  PP almost died, remember that stabbing?  You dont think that was gang-related?

If you ever got out of your &quot;wicked&quot; NE bubble, you may learn that evn cold blooded killers are in the NBA, NFL, selling us records, etc.  PP is not the only gangster in NBA.

Having money and a nice house doesnt mean anything, but that is your typical attitude of ppl like you, not knowing anything, but how you live your life.

Jennifer, you are so wrong its wicked funny.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Does anyone know what the hand gesture was supposed to mean or what it&#039;s supposed to represent? Because I think I saw KG do a similar gesture when he was running back up the court after scoring a basket earlier in the series.

Could it just be something similar to the Quentin Richardson, Darius Miles, and fellow Clippers holding up three and banging their foreheads a couple of years back every time they made a 3 pointer?]]></description>
