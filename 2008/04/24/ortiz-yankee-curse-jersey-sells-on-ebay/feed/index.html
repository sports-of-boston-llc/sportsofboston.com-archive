		<description><![CDATA[2004carman is obviously a very experienced ebay buyer. As I was watching the bidding, I was thinking how silly the bidders were for driving up the price. 

Yet, the silliest thing is certainly the fact that someone paid so much money for something so useless. There is no curse. It&#039;s just a huge media frenzy. If this had all come out in 10 years and there had actually had been a curse, this would be a whole different story. Everyone else will realize how useless this jersey is soon. People will forget about this whole ordeal, but 2004carman will still be out $175,100. At least it all went to charity.]]></description>
