		<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s ok. To Jeff, they sold for about $300 a ticket, not $3000....big difference.

The fact is that most &quot;average fans&quot; who ended up with Monster seats sold them to ticket brokers, scalped them themselves, or at the least &#039;traded up&#039; with them. As in, &#039;I&#039;ll trade my Monster seats to a Kansas City game for good seats to a Yankees game.&#039;  What does that all mean? It means the Monster tickets are worth a lot more in the open market.

To be frank, if a bunch of tourists, rich people, and pink hats want to sit 40 feet above left field, good for them! If they get those seats, maybe there will be more of the truly good seats left for schlubs like me. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s neat to sit on the Monster, but it certainly is not the best view of the game. I&#039;d rather sit elsewhere. And I&#039;d rather the Sox get the money than the scalpers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s interesting that the Red Sox are actually doing this. I read an article last year that the NFL was going to officially and exclusively associate itself with an online ticket reseller like Stub Hub. Not sure if they have done it yet but the crux of the article was that in the future all NFL teams would use the auction process to sell their seats effectively eliminating face value tickets. 
It sucks for the fans but it makes a lot of sense for the owners.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I guess my problem with it is the location of the tickets. If they wanted to auction off luxury box suites or front row seats I wouldn&#039;t mind because the &quot;average fan&quot; can&#039;t afford those seats anyway. 

But I thought the Monster Seats were an opportunity to give the average fan one of the most unique views in all of Major League Baseball. It seemed like an addition for the fans, and now they are effectively pricing out people who can&#039;t afford $3,000 a ticket. The question is, where do they go next?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know they have a high payroll, but its now 4th in Major League Baseball and WAY behind the Yankees 200+ million dollar payroll. With a small ballpark of under 40,000, that&#039;s huge considering they could probably fill 50,000 every night.

It doesn&#039;t seem right but its just the same as what would happen anyway: scalpers or StubHub would get the seats at face value and sell them at a huge profit: wouldn&#039;t you rather the team get those profits to spend on the players than some fat angelino who&#039;s gonna screw more people?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Should the Red Sox be allowed? Of course. It&#039;s their park and their seats. They can charge and sell them according to what ever plan they wish.  You, as a fan, have no right to that ticket.

If someone doesn&#039;t like the arrangement, don&#039;t buy a ticket. 

I think the auction is a great idea! It gives fans access to games that in the past they would have had to hunt down a season ticket holder for or buy from a scalper. Speaking from experience, that can be very difficult. This way they actually have a realistic shot at those tickets--if they are willing to pay the fee.  As it should be.

As long as the team continues to put the majority of the money back into the team and thus continues to be a top MLB team, then I don&#039;t have a single complaint.]]></description>
