		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s such a shame that these disorders are kept quiet and ignored. Athletes are heros, so nobody wants to admit that they suffer from the same problems as us. I suffered from post-concussive syndrome. It sucked. I couldn&#039;t get out of bed in the morning, let alone play pro football (not that I&#039;m particularly qualified when I&#039;m well). It&#039;s not fair that players are held to such an unrealistic standard. Yeah, we want to win games, but the player&#039;s health should be the first priority.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ted Johnson said he had over thirty concussive &quot;events&quot;, yet he only reported one, the second within ten days. He had split a helmet at one point because of his tackling style. Most experts say his blows to the crown of the head and pituatary gland damaged from &quot;ehancers&quot; may be the larger cause of his symptoms. He does not have the &quot;classic&quot; pcs symptoms. Key to his condition is the fact that he does not have white spots or as Nowinskie calls them Vaso spasms on the top of his brain in MRI. It has been found in the military and boxing, vaso spasms are precursors to Parkinsons,  Alsheimers and pugilistica dementia.
Leading to the conclusion he does not have a boxers future. Since he wore an intra oral splint developed with Marvin Haggler, he escaped the consequences of concussion from blows to the jaw or a boxers glass jaw.
The Military is now researching the posibility of protecting our soldiers with the same device used on 70% of Patriot players, yet the NFL sits on its hands.
Stating recently at the Liegh Stienberg concussion symposium, mouth guards have no affect on concussion, what a farce. www.mahercor.com]]></description>
