		<description><![CDATA[Loved your April 30 column KC.  Thanks for quoting me - I really needed an outlet for my frustrations, and my basketball hating wife just looks at me strangely when I rant and rave around the house.  Your analysis of the coach of the year farce was right on, and evidently Paul Pierce was more than willing to follow your advice with excellent results.
    It was sad to see how lost Tony Allen looked when he was actually allowed to play for a few minutes.  Keeping T. Allen and E. House out of the games and out of sync is going to cost the Celts down the road, I fear.  Personally, I&#039;m thrilled to see Perkins in early foul trouble.  It gives Powe a chance to play, and he&#039;s so much smarter than Perkins that it usually works out for the best.
     Now let&#039;s see if the Celts can move the show to Atlanta and put those upstarts away once and for all.  Keep up the good work!!]]></description>
