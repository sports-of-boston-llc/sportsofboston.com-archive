		<description><![CDATA[I think KC can vouch for me on this, in 2004 I said the following, &quot;Ortiz is a dominant player right now, but even though he only plays DH, because of his weight and the way his stance is, he won&#039;t be dominant for half a dozen years.&quot;

There&#039;s no doubt he could still jack 40 homers this year, but the guy will not last too much longer unless he takes off some weight/changes his stance]]></description>
