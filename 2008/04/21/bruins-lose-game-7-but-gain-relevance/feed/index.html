		<description><![CDATA[I gotta disagree a little. Yes, forcing a game 7 put them on the sports scene for a moment, hell even I watched the game last night for a little.

But while making the playoffs and losing in 7 may be viewed as a &quot;step in the right direction&quot;, this team is very far away from having anyone other than hockey fans care in Boston. They needed to win this series and knock out the No. 1 seed to gain any real momentum heading into next season. Even if they would have lost in the second round by a sweep, they might have caught the eye of some new fans.

This team proved last night it is still not close to a team like Montreal talent wise. The Bruins need an influx of new talent in order to compete in the NHL. I think they have the right coach in Julien, but without two or three legit scorers and another hearty defender added, plus an elite goaltender (Tim Thomas is a nice story but he&#039;s no Marty Brodeur), we won&#039;t be talkin about the Bruins for another 11.5 months.]]></description>
