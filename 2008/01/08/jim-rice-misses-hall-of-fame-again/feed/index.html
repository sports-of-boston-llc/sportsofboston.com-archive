		<description><![CDATA[It would be shame of the highest magnitude if Jim Ed Rice did not get into the HOF next year (2009). He deserves to have his number 14 retired next to Ted Williams, Yaz, Fisk, Doer and Cronin. He is the only African-American to play his entire professional career on the Boston Red Sox. This is a team that sent so many great HOF&#039;s to NY (Robinson, Mays, Ruth) Yes, Jackie Robinson (Dodgers) instead of playing his career in Beantown and Willie (Say Hey) Mays in center. Imagine 1946-55 instead of NY teams. Jim Rice has a destiny and that is to see his record in Cooperstown. Even Goose Gossage said if there was any hitter he feared it was Rice. Godspeed Jim!
2009 for Rice and Henderson.]]></description>
