		<description><![CDATA[The Sox did drop their offer but they had offered the reported deals. They were definately on the table during the winter meetings. And the Twins GM almost accepted it but said no the last minute.

Reports from them have been a bit unclear but the deal was out there. Shortly after the winter meetings the deal was probably just as strong. 

Then yah the deal got lowered a lot. 

Something in the dynamics of this deal got changed. Boston and the Yankees didn&#039;t want to pay the two fold cost of prospects and money. Dumb if you ask me, because Johan is worth it. All these guys are no guarantee to be much help to any MLB team.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think it was more the fact that the Red Sox never really offered what the reports said they were offering. The Twins obviously don&#039;t think they are contenders if they trade him so keeping him in the AL wouldn&#039;t have been that big of a deal if they in fact were going to receive Ellsbury and Hanson in return. I don&#039;t think the Sox were really in to get him, more to keep him out of the Bronx. So once the Yanks moved on (thankfully), the Sox probly dropped their offer or offered much less.]]></description>
