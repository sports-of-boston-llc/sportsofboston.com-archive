		<description><![CDATA[Yeah I don&#039;t understand what it is about the Bobcats. They just seem caught off guard in the two times they&#039;ve faced em. Jason Richardson is one BIG reason they can beat the Celtics, and maybe a little Michael Jordan is rubbing on the rest of the bunch. I bet he wants to keep 72-10 a record...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not gonna lie, I was so disinterested in this game that I watched DVR&#039;d re-runs of The Office for most of it. Just watchin&#039; the last 8 minutes or so, the refs were terrible but we weren&#039;t going to win with JRich playing like that.

He was phenomenal. Pierce was on him like glue and still he made the shot over him. The Bobcats knew it to, after the game Gerald Wallace even said &quot;Pierce played great defense but JRich was just on fire and couldn&#039;t miss.

I still think they could have won but without Ray Allen and Big Baby they were hurtin&#039;. 

What is it about the Bobcats that gives us so much trouble?]]></description>
