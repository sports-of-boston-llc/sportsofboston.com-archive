		<description><![CDATA[Yes, we went and got there at 8:30 am and I think it really stunk, we are huge patriot fans, and they just kept hipping up the crowd and then nothing would happen, we went there with our kids and family and it was snowing and really cold and the cheerleaders came out and Pat The Patriot and then it was another draw out thing, they kept saying lets see more highlights of the past weeks game, if I wanted to see that I would have watched it at home a million times. So finally we left at 11:00, and there was lot of people leaving and upset. Frozen and didnt even see anything, I should have stayed home and watched the highlights of that on tv.

Go Patriots, but dont forget your frozen fans, and not just Boston! New England too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!]]></description>
