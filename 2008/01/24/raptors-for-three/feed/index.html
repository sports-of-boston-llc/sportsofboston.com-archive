Indeed an interesting idea. They are basically setting up a futures market for ticket sales. It works for the team/ticketing site since your &quot;bet&quot; is non-refundable and only serves to guarantee you the ability to purchase your tickets (at face value). It would be interesting to see if the insurance bet on the ticket changes based on how well/poorly the team does for the remainder of the season. It&#039;s a risk, and you&#039;d need to factor your insurance bet into the price, but on the other hand, you wouldn&#039;t have to end up paying an obscene price to a scalper. Interesting idea! I&#039;d like to follow it to see how the prices change for the different teams.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Raptors may have put up a good show but I think it&#039;s telling that they only squeaked this one out. If the toughest competition in recent memory comes from a team that can only win by ONE BASKET, then I think we&#039;ve got a stellar shot at the playoffs.

Speaking of which, there was a thing in the Globe today; apparently the C&#039;s partnered up with a site called Ticket Reserve to let people buy some playoff tickets if they make it (which shouldn&#039;t really be a doubt in anyone&#039;s mind): &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2008/01/25/celtics_sell_rights_to_buy_tickets_to_playoffs/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;boston.com&lt;/a&gt;

I guess the site calls it &quot;insurance for fans&quot;, and it looks like you spend a tiny bit of money and if your boys make it to the finals you get to buy a ticket at face value instead of paying some ridiculous fee on eBay or whatever. Seems like a sweet deal, especially for a team that&#039;s as sure a bet as the Celts.]]></description>
