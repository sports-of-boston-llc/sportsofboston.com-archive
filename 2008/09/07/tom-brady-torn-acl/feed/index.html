		<description><![CDATA[The patriots are THE BEST TEAM in the league, not just because of Tom Brady.  They have the heart to win every single game that they play, and if it is not in God&#039;s plan for them to go to the superbowl, then so be it.  It is not because Tom Brady is out.  Tom Brady WAS a great asset, but they can still go to the superbowl, and they WILL.  Go New England Patriots!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Liz, I agree. After losing the Super Bowl, are we really going to just hand the AFC East to the Jets? Cassell proved capable of winning a game (aka Sunday against the Chiefs) but how will he do against winning teams? And is Chris Simms really the answer? Simms needs to know the system better before he could ever take over.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Brady came in to play after Bledsoe was injuried. People were saying the same thing about him then as they are now about Cassel. Who says that Cassel can&#039;t pull a winning season off? I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s likely, Tom Brady is a one of a kind QB who is irreplaceble no matter who is stepping up to the plate. I&#039;m only saying that we, the fans, can&#039;t be completely dismayed because of something like this. We are a superior and outstanding team in all respects, not simply our quarterbacking skills. We&#039;ve got great receivers, excellent backs, and a good line. I know I personally survived the hell and disappointment of last year&#039;s superbowl defeat, and I refuse to think that our season is over only 11 minutes into it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that brady could be ok but it didnt look good at all. If they bring in another QB they have Daunte or Chris Simms. Simms is a good quality quarterback and Daunte could reunite with moss. We could win 10 games maybe. Still indisbelief about the injury tho!]]></description>
