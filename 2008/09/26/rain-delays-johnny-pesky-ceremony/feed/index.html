		<description><![CDATA[A well earned tribute to a loyal man.

When I was working on my novel Timely Persuasion, I included a chapter set at the 1946 world series to help vindicate Pesky from his undeserved goat horns.  It ended up getting cut from the final book, but it feels appropriate to re-visit it this weekend to help honor #6.  You can check it out here for free online:

Enjoy!]]></description>
