		<description><![CDATA[Who would have predicted that the September matchup vs the Tampa Rays would loom so large?  Right now it&#039;s the Pedroia show and Ortiz and Jason Bay and company are just along for the ride...  The Sox&#039;s lineup is so much deeper and better than the Rays, but that Rays staff and bullpen is scary good!  Got my $20 tickets in hand for Tuesday game (yeah I&#039;m cheap but whatcha gonna do? I&#039;m a sucka for the bleachers). I can&#039;t wait to see how this shakes out.  The rosters expanded allow Francona the flexibility to make pitching changes and give some breathers in blowouts.  The Wild Card is ours to lose...The Division is OURS TO WIN!
