		<description><![CDATA[Brandon Jacobs injury risk isn&#039;t even the worst thing about him.  With Ward and Bradshaw there, his carries could get split.  Forte is at least a pretty solid #1 guy (I don&#039;t think Kevin Jones will give him much of a push).  Also, Chicago&#039;s QB play should be awful, so he should have plenty of touches.  Time will tell if it was too early.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Last season in 12 games, he completed 58.2% of his passes for 1,911 yds, 9 TD and 12 INT. Those numbers are terrible, especially if you stretch them out over a full season.

He is only owned in 2% of all Yahoo! leagues.

Tavaris Jackson sucks. I&#039;d rather have Tito Jackson as a QB.]]></description>
