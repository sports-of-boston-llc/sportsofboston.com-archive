		<description><![CDATA[If anything, I&#039;d say Belichick played it perfectly, not allowing Brady to play in the pre-season. The risk was too much; if he ever was injured during one of those games, he&#039;d never hear the end of it. Like Jason says, this was just bad lack; I blame it oh chaos theory.

Plus, Belichick&#039;s decision gave Cassel the ability to learn the plays and have more time with the first team. It&#039;s almost as if Belichick saw this coming...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Are you implying that not playing in the preseason is the reason a guy bent Brady&#039;s leg in ways it isn&#039;t designed?  We all know Brady is a statue in the pocket, he always has been.

What&#039;s the excuse for when this happened to Carson Palmer?  It wouldn&#039;t have happened if the Bengals missed the playoffs? C&#039;mon.

This is just not a very smart or well thought out argument.  It&#039;s bad luck. That&#039;s all it is.]]></description>
