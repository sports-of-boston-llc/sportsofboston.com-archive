		<description><![CDATA[@JG:

Hey to make my point, I used any and all evidence that made sense. 

Not saying this applies to you or me, but I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a fair share of guys that bring their wives/kids to the game, and then have to deal with their whining all the way home, ESPECIALLY after a horrible loss. 

Now two hours of kids&#039; whining in traffic is pretty bad, but if you wait until the end of the game and pour out of the stadium with 50,000 other people, have fun dealing with cranky kids and 5 hours of traffic! Catch my drift?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Pats fans pay big bucks for the tickets, and if they&#039;re watching crap on the field they have every right to boo. Does Ellis Hobbs know the absurd traffic leaving the stadium? Why would anyone wanna sit in traffic for five hours to digest a disgusting loss. 

It&#039;s the first thing a Pats player has said that has made me angry in a longgggggggg time.]]></description>
