		<description><![CDATA[I agree.  They have the grading system for this reason.  Your performance is bad, your grade drops; your performance is good, your grade increases.  Good grades earn you higher profile games and playoff appearances (which means extra money).  He&#039;s been a good ref, no reason to dismiss him.  If he continues to be good, he&#039;ll earn his good grades back.  The NFL hung him out to dry to appease the SD fans.  The DeSean Jackson call was correctly overturned on replay, but yes, they blew the initial call.  And, I&#039;m all for more review.  Let the players play through the whistles and get the play right.  Even QBs aren&#039;t made of glass; if they can&#039;t take a hit, they should be on dancing with the stars, not the gridiron!]]></description>
