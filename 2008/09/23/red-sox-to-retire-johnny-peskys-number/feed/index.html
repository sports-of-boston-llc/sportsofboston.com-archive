		<description><![CDATA[I agree it&#039;s about time to get 14 (Rice), 21 (Clemens), 26 (Boggs), 45 (Martinez), etc on the facade.  In the era of free agency, it&#039;ll be hard for Red Sox heroes to meet all the requirements.  The team was just shifting from Rice (who should make the Baseball HOF) to Clemens and Boggs when I was growing up.  They were great Red Sox and part of many good teams, but didn&#039;t get to wrap it up in Boston, but should be retired.  Hopefully, 2009 will be a year to hand out more rings and put some numbers up!]]></description>
