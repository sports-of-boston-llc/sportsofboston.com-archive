		<description><![CDATA[Truly an amazing performance.  It&#039;s a shame you have to stay up until midnight to see something like this.  An awful lot of my friends never got to see the second half of that game.  Sometimes it just pays to be a fanatic!!

I have to eat some crow and take my hat off to Ray Allen.  He&#039;s made a great comeback in this series, and he was absolutely terrific in this monumental win.  Playing every single minute of the game, and playing well, including a ridiculous reverse layup a la Jordan, and that delightful one- on-one at the end that left Vujacic&#039;s jockstrap on the floor.

I wonder if Doc is asking himself why he ignored Eddie House until now.  Considering the rust he must have, he played a helluva game too.  And Pierce.  And Posey.  Just can&#039;t say enough about the whole team.  One more!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Defense really does win championships. The Lakers and Western Conference in general are just too finesse. The Cavs and Pistons were so strong defensively, facing the Lakers must be like a big sigh of relief for the Celtics.

BEAT LA!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#039;I don&#039;t believe...what I just saw!&#039;

There&#039;s really no explaining that game last night. I&#039;ve watched every second of every game in the NBA Finals and nearly every minute of the playoffs, but when Perk left hurt and the Celts deficit went from 12 back to 20 halfway thru the third, I was seconds away from turning it off. Thank God I didn&#039;t.

This is both a great comeback and a great choke. The Celts played incredible defense in the second half and James Posey was integral off the bench.

How sweet was it to to see that European douchebag Vujacic get completely owned by Ray Allen in the waning moments. That was horrendous defense and THEN they inbound the ball and waste a timeout. A complete lack of composure by the Lakers and great poise by the Celts.

We&#039;re one win away....let&#039;s finish it on Sunday!]]></description>
