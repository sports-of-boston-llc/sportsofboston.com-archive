		<description><![CDATA[My guess that Manny was late to the brawl seems right. From the Globe: &quot;I think they were just exchanging some views on things,&quot; he said. &quot;We had a lot of testosterone going tonight. It was kind of a hectic night. Sometimes those things happen. It wasn&#039;t really a big deal, it won&#039;t be a big deal, it happens. We&#039;ll get by that one. In fact, it&#039;s been handled and we&#039;ll move on from that one.&quot;

Ramírez was a bit tardy getting to the bench-clearing brawl, not entering the fray until the bullpen residents had reached the mound, jogging out late with Bartolo Colon a few steps ahead of him.

I bet he didnt charge because of his achy hamstring , but who knows.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Will we look back on this game like we do on the Tek v. A-Rod fight?  I know the Rays aren&#039;t the Yankees, but don&#039;t we still have pride in Coco and want him to stick around for the season?  We can&#039;t trade him now can we?  This is what the Red Sox needed, a shot in the arm and a sweep of the Rays to overtake 1st place.  We&#039;re in it to win it now!!  By the way, what happened between Youk and Manny?
