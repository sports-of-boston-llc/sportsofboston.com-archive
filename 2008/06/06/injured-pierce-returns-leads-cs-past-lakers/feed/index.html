		<description><![CDATA[Quite a thrilling game.  The Celts must be breathing a sigh of relief to be playing a team with such second rate defensive performers.  After facing Detroit&#039;s defense, this must seem like a walk in the park.  The only way I can see LA beating Boston is if the Lakers just go nuts offensively and the Celts have a complete defensive and offensive breakdown.
     
Then again, there is the unsettling memory of the &quot;away game syndrome&quot; against Atlanta and Cleveland.  And if Pierce is not up to par....well then, all bets are off.  Glad to see Pierce finally getting his due from national broadcasting people.  He&#039;s been a well kept secret for far too long.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This was classic Boston Celtics finals action.  You know Larry Bird was in Indiana, with a Miller Lite in one hand and a foam finger on the other hand, proud as a father watching Pierce go down in the third and then get right back up!!  It was Bird-esque and the stuff legends are made of.
