		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I thought it was pretty clever.

Seriously, don&#039;t touch James. I got him in round 2 of last year&#039;s draft and I could have had Tom Brady in that round.

In round 1 I got Rudi Johnson. He played 11 games and averaged 2.9 ypc and 3 TD&#039;s. I could have had Brian Westbrook!!!!!!!

So my first 2 rounds were a complete waste and I didn&#039;t recover with those 2 in my backfield all season.]]></description>
