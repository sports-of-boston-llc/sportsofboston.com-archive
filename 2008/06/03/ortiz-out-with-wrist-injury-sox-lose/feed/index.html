		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not too worried either. Obviously he&#039;s a big loss, but we can pick up the slack while he&#039;s gone.

I also heard rumors about Barry Bonds becoming our DH. Could it be?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have talked with a few people who are worried. I am not. As Timmy pointed out earlier to me, so you move Manny to DH and let him rest for a while. You play Coco and Ellsbury and there are worse things that can happen. Yes, you lose the 1-2 punch in your order, but you still have a pretty nasty offensive machine and wouldn&#039;t we rather have this happen in August then October.

Get Well Soon Papi.
