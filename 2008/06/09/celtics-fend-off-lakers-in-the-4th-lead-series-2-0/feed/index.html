		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s my thought on the game, the Lakers are whiney little bits.  All they did in their post game press conference was complain about the officiating.  Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the Celtics were a little more agressive taking the ball to the hoop then the Lakers were and that&#039;s why they got to the free throw line so many more times then the Lakers did.  Not to mention, the Celtics didn&#039;t have time to foul the Lakers because they turned the ball over before they even got into their offense.

GO CELTS!!

		<description><![CDATA[Right on Jeff.

The lakers are very finesse and it looks like they won&#039;t change that part about them. 

I don&#039;t know anyone on the lakers willing to step up and push the celtics back. The c&#039;s have been pushing them around all series and I don&#039;t see it changing.

Kobe won&#039;t be physical enough, and certainly not pau gasol or radmonavic. Lamar odom may be from New York but he plays like he&#039;s from spain or something.

The lakers really need to foul rondo hard when he blows by derek fisher...thatll make rajon think twice about it.

I say celts can definitely win one game in LA and are capable of wrapping up the series there. If not...games 6 and 7 are in boston.

BEAT LA!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some thoughts:
-Leon Powe is a God

-The Lakers bench is overrated. Anyone else think that Luke Walton looks like a deer in headlights every time he steps on the floor? What happened to him, I thought he was a good player?

-That was nearly heart attack city, I was getting flashbacks of February 3......

-That said, I don&#039;t think the near comeback/collapse will have ANY effect on the rest of the series. Unless the Celts plan on playing no defense and throwing alley oops and the Lakers plan on hitting seven threes every quarter, then it won&#039;t matter.

-This is a race to win four games, at this point it doesn&#039;t matter how you beat a team, it&#039;s all about the Ws

-How great is it to realize that for the Lakers to win the series, they&#039;re going to have to beat the Celts 4 out of 5 times and at least once at home

-I&#039;m trying not to be overconfident but with the way Ray and Pierce are playing, we could finish this thing in LA, but I would take one outta three

-We won last night with KG having an off night and the Lakers shooting very well from behind the arc. Pau Gasol always seems to dominate early then fade down the stretch of games, talk about a finesse team.
