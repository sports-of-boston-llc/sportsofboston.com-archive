		<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s missing from this story is that the New York Mets sent out a press release about the firing at 3:14am eastern time, two hours after the team BEAT the Angels.

It&#039;s a disgraceful act by the Mets who fired their manager and two coaches in the middle of the night on the west coast. Reports are that the Mets basically told them to find their own way home. 

Everyone knew Randolph was probably out the door, so why did the Mets let him travel cross country and fire him anyways? Pathetic statement out the Mets organization and GM Omar Minaya.]]></description>
