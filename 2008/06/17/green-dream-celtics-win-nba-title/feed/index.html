		<description><![CDATA[Hard to imagine a more delightful ending to the playoffs - utter destruction of the Lakers and a huge dose of reality for all those pundits who said the West will kill the East in the end.  An amazing 4 quarter effort by the C&#039;s as they simply dismantled Kobe and his second rate supporting cast.  If I&#039;m not mistaken, L.A. played a total of eight games this season against the Celts, and lost six of them, which pretty much reflects what the Celts did to the West as a whole this year.

It&#039;s been 22 years since I felt this happy at the end of a basketball season, and after watching 110 games on television this year, I plan to celebrate!!  Go Celtics!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Building a dream team doesn&#039;t guarantee a title (see the Lakers adding Karl Malone, for example), but I think we knew we had something special.  There were a lot of question marks opening the season despite the acquisitions (Ronda / PG depth, Perkins, the bench, etc), but this team grew together as a unit over the season.  This team was so hungry for the title, looking better with each series.  After the awful last season, then not getting the #1 or #2 pick in the draft, then not getting KG initially (and being assessed as not even worthy of his talent) to this is just amazing.  Enjoy this sweet victory!]]></description>
