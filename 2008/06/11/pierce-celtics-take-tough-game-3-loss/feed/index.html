		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think you can really start putting blame on Paul Pierce.  What a guy isn&#039;t allowed to have an off night?  I understand it&#039;s the finals and that having an off night in the finals could end your finals run, but Pierce has put us on his back ever since Game #7 against the Hawks and has been steady ever since.  Cut the guy some slack and let him get back into his groove tomorrow night.  If he doesn&#039;t, then you have a case.  

I am with everyone that says we need more from KG.  Get him the ball a hundred times a game if we have to and let&#039;s get #17 done.

		<description><![CDATA[I blame this loss on Pierce. Yes, Garnett didn&#039;t shoot the ball well but at least he did other things (12 boards I think).

Pierce shoots 2-14 from the field and had some CRUCIAL turnovers in the fourth. It&#039;s a possibility that foul trouble kept him from getting a rhythm and his knee may have been sore from the travel, but the captain needs to play better in the NBA Finals, plain and simple.

The other thing which ticked me off was late in the fourth where the Celts decided to trap Kobe in the middle of the court near half court, he dished easily to Odom who found a wide open Vujacic for another dagger three. They didn&#039;t trap all game and left a hot shooter wide open. I understand you&#039;d rather have Vujacic beat you but they trapped in a bad position and suffered the consequences.

Seeing a game like last night makes me nervous about the other games in LA. Yes, you can say we were lucky to be in the game, but Gasol, Odom and Fischer all didn&#039;t show up AND the Lakers missed a ton of free throws and they still won. We&#039;ll see if KG and the truth show up in Game 4 or the pressure is gonna build real fast]]></description>
