		<description><![CDATA[Wicked Pissa Dude, you&#039;re right. It was a reach in foul, especially from behind, but the refs will never ever call that on the road in the closing seconds of an NBA finals game. 

liz - You make a good point too. Dick Bavetta was reffing the game and he&#039;s known to be a Lakers-friendly official. This will be one long offseason for David Stern in dealing with Donaghy&#039;s allegations.

		<description><![CDATA[Anybody that watched last night’s game can see that disgraced ref, Tim Donaghy was NOT lying with regards to favorable or no calls for the so-called star players.  KG’s third and fourth fouls called against him were truly unbelievable.  The no-calls for traveling and fouling favoring the Lakers are too numerous to laugh off anymore.  It is beyond doubt scandalous.  Stern can lie or deny what he wants but if it looks, smells and sounds like a duck….Quack Quack Mr. Stern.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Paul Pierce is unstoppable, just ask Kobe Bryant who could only stop him by fouling him and ending up with a dunk down the other end on a terrible no call.  That said, you never once heard any of the Celtics bitch about it, you just move on and play another day.  That&#039;s because the Boston Celtics are a classy organization.

Game 6 is OUR GAME!!

Go Celts!!
