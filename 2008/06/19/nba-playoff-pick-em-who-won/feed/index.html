I think I picked too many upsets at KC&#039;s urging haha (I think that was his plan to force me out of contention).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YEAH!! I didn&#039;t actually expect to win this thing when I picked Garnett as the mvp, but cool anyways. This years playoffs were a great run and not just because of the Celtics winning it all but there were just some good basketball games played throughout. Now the NBA draft is headed our way. I&#039;ll be watching for Gary Forbes outta my UMass. The NBA is still exciting for another week or so haha.]]></description>
