		<description><![CDATA[haahhaahahhaahh too classic. And it makes you wonder why one of the announcers said earlier in the series &quot;he&#039;s a guy opposing fans love to hate but I don&#039;t see why&quot;. 

Not only is he hot tempered and a crybaby (he said basically &#039;the reason i let Ray go by me was because they were calling fouls every time i touched him!&#039; btw, he was only called for THREE fouls during the game), not only that but he&#039;s TERRIBLE AT DEFENSE. I coulda played better D than him on that final Allen drive. In that situation there&#039;s no way you let him by you for an easy bucket. terrible, just terrible]]></description>
