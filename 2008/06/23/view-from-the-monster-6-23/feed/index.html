		<description><![CDATA[WPD-- Thanks for the comment!  You raise a great point that we are maintaining first despite a number of key contributors on the shelf.  As I mentioned, Drew has really stepped up.  I don&#039;t want to overlook the Rays because they have the potential to go deep IF they make additions, however, with the rumors being shot down of acquiring Griffey due to cost, I wonder if they&#039;ll get the commitment at the deadline.  The Yankees will come around, so if the Rays do fade, we have a five game lead, enough to let our guys coalesce :)  We really haven&#039;t fired on all cylinders yet, so you&#039;re right, post All-Star break could be fun!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tough weekend for the Sox.  I agree, they definately should&#039;ve taken 2-3 from the Cards, but the fact that we still lead in the AL East with some injuries and people just returning from injuries gives me great hope about our club after the all star break.
