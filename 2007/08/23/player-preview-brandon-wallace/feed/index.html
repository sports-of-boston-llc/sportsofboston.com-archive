		<description><![CDATA[Noone can get through our B-Wall!

B-Wall will be a force to be reckoned with. Albeit a very thin easily moved force that could prove to be a definitely valuable 14th or 15th man on a 12 man roster. 

Just wait til he&#039;s 26 and in his prime!

BTW - Perk rocks! He has shown that he has the best attitude for dealing with sub mediocrity and foot pain. What a publicly great guy. He needs to be invited over for a bbq.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK, I&#039;ll admit the projection is a little rough. I should have run the numbers out a little more. But, for example, let me dissect Kendrick Perkins&#039;s first season (03-04), in which he averaged just 3.5 minutes per game. He had 2.2 points and 1.4 boards per game...which if stretched to 20 minutes is 12.6 points and 8 boards. If stretched to 40 minutes, Perk would win the MVP with averages of 25.1 points and 16 rebounds per game....in his rookie season. I&#039;m just saying that playing a few minutes in a few games can lead to inflated averages. And Wallace should have a season like Perk&#039;s first season (10 games, 3.5 mpg, 2.2 ppg, 1.4 rpg).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[that projection is retarded.  he&#039;s going to average 2 boards and 1 block in two minutes a game?  We should play him twenty minutes a game and enjoy his average game of fourteen points, twenty boards, ten blocks and five assists!  Imagine if we play him forty minutes a game?  The Brandon Wallace Era has begun!]]></description>
