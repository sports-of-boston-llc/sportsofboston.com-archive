		<description><![CDATA[Beating your chest and cursing when you walk down the floor after making a layup over a much smaller defender doesn&#039;t make you a leader. KG is heralded as a great player when he consitently disappears during crunch time. Kevin plays hard every game. He is a great defender, but not a great offensive player. With all of KG&#039;s skills along with his height, he doesn&#039;t dominate on the offensive end the way that he should. Nevertheless in my opinion, KG is overrated; a good player that is too inconsistent to be considered great.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is absolutely right. KG hasn&#039;t convinced me that he is in fact a franchise player due to the fact that he has never shown or done anything to put himself on the same level of many greatest forwards who ever played this game.

I remember when he had Cassell and Sprewell to compelement him with and they made it all the way to the Western Conference. I noticed that KG never stepped his game up and relied most on the outside shots and passing to teammates instead of taking it to the paint and posting up against defenders. Unlike Kobe Bryant and Lebron James, they knew the importance of being aggressive and taking more shots more than their teammates since they knew that it the primary way to win big games ---stepping up to the next level and not being afraid to take shots.  

KG didn&#039;t show me that drive and never has, sure he was a great all-around player, but he was more like Scottie Pippen, a good complement player but not a big factor to carry the whole team on his shoulder. 

To me a good rebounder must always be consistent with the numbers regardless of what team he plays on. I do think he is an exceptional rebounder but I realized that he is not on the same level of Olujawons, Barkleys, and Duncans since with the Boston his stats had dramatically gone done. This proves that when was playing for Wolves he was the only player who can rebound well while on Boston he was in the competition among his teammates. I don&#039;t care if he had good players around him who can grab boards, there is still no excuse that his scoring and rebounding stats are down since he is still at his prime. (If you notice Rodman, Malone, Barkley, Olajuwon, Ewing, at their primes they brought big numbers on the boards despite of having good rebounder teammates around them)

If you ever notice that his assists stats over the years were remarkably high, but his scoring numbers were never really that impressive for his height and athleticsm(with his height, lenght, quickness, athletcism he could easily increase is average points per game higher yearly). If he had just learned to become more agressive offensively and stop trying to be like Scottie Pippen, then maybe his team would have won more wins because of his domination on the scoring end.

Just watch the Celtics-Hawks game, see how much time he&#039;s on the court and cannot consistently produce high numbers. He should be scoring 30 point a nite and about 10 rebounds per game, since this is the playoffs where it all counts. If you watch Tim Duncan play on all his playoff games, you would see why he is far better than Kevin Garnett.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yep he&#039;s right KG is overrated. He doesn&#039;t do enough for his teammates. The one thing he can do that nobody else on his team ever could was play in the post and he has refused to do so consistently throughout his career. 

He&#039;s a very good player but he&#039;s not top 10. He&#039;s probably not top 15 either.

Skip is on point. KG has time to turn this around and re-establish himself he still has years left.]]></description>
