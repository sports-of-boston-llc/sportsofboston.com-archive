		<description><![CDATA[The question is:  how long will Moss stay interested, and not distracted?  Maybe for a year or two, after all it is cool in New England to be focused on the field, not as cool to be seen at strip club, or bouncing in the mosh pit.  About the only Pat for which off-field antics are worshipped is QB Tom - because he just appears to be so darn wholesome.  Randy must stay in shape and not get hurt, but with any luck, with youth comes good health.
Like Terry Glenn, and like Corey Dillon, we can probably hold Randy&#039;s attention long enough to bring another banner or two to Foxboro.]]></description>
