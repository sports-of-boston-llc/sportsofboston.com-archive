		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think the punishment should be take a draft pick away. Especially a first round pick. We got Moss for a 4th round pick. Taking away a 1st would be MUCH more serious. It should just be a fine. Maybe just from Bill Belichick or from the organization, meaning Bob Kraft. How about 50,000 from Belichick? 

And getting extra tape on a team is just getting a competitive advantage on a team, still cheating but its not that bad. Most teams change their signals anyway between games with one opponent. Especially by year they must be completely different. The Pats didn&#039;t beat the Jets because of this.

This story I think is really overblown. There is more cheating going on during a game with players then with this incident.

But still the Pats should be punished. They cheated. And whatever the punishment is, the Pats should take it.]]></description>
