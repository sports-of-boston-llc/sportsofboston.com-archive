		<description><![CDATA[dockevoc, thanks. I agree if we were going to wait more with Durant and Oden...we wouldn&#039;t have the chance to grab the gold like we do now. 

bobby, I assume you give Danny an A+ for his offseason? I will admit it&#039;s been pretty impressive; it&#039;s a great time to be a celtics fan.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Getting a 10 time allstar and former MVP Kevin Garnett and 7 time allstar and been 2nd team all-nba Ray allen paired with our 5time allstar Paul Pierce (each of the 3 has led teams to the conference finals and had their best seasons numbers-wise and efficiency rating and wins produced on their best/most succesful/talented teams)......

getting them 2 acquired out of the team ith the 2nd worst record in the NBA while keeping pierce is very impressive. Those 3 seem to complement each other beautifully on the court and be a perfect fit in all ways (character, goals, leadership, phase of career, humility, hunger, drive, team players, highly efficient, loyalty, versatile) ........... and landing Posey, House, and Pollard (three proven veteran roleplayers that have done the job for contenders in the past) to fill out the rotation late offseason was very good as well.......... No bad contracts, no panic moves, we&#039;re all set to make an impact next offseason and make a BIGTIME run at the ring for 08/09 but we also did enough to not hurt our chances and have a legitimate chance if things go right to win the ring this year......... should be a special team and a powerhouse for hte next 4 or 5 years. This team would be among the best with phoenix and them out west, in the east they should dominate. And they will be even better next season when ainge has the offseason to fill out the building around the 3 core A+ all-nba superstars............... GO CELTICS!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great article...Celts probably have a better shot over the next 3 years to win it all than they maybe ever would with Durant or Oden...obviously you never know, but the East is prime for the taking and with a player or two added to this roster over the next 1-3 years, I really like their chances]]></description>
