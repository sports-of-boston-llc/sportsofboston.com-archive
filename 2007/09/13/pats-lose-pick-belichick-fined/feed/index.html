		<description><![CDATA[We may have deserved it...but it least it makes the NFL an even playing field from the &quot;video camera on the sidelines&quot; standpoint. No other team (if they were doing it) will use a camera on the sidelines anymore, but that doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;ll try something else. This is a severe slap of the wrist, but with the offseason that Goodell just went through (Vick, Pacman Jones, Chris Henry, among others), I think he had to make this choice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The pick thing is BS. Come on Commish! The money seems right because it hurts the people who cheated.  Who does taking a pick hurt? The people who cheated. The people who didn&#039;t. And most importantly the fans! Thats what gets me. Why take out the Patriots cheating on the fans too. What if the Pats were a bad team? Why hold us back?

He needs to rethink things. Suspend Belichick. Fine the team and coach. Just leave the fans out of it. We just want to see our team compete.]]></description>
