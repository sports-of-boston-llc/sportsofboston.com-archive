		<description><![CDATA[I do not think there should be an age limit and you bring up some very good points. I also wrote a blog on this but I when at it in a different way. Instead, I talked about how the NBA has the age limit because it is good for their business and not for the players. You can read my blog at http://askinf1.blogspot.com/2009/12/nba-is-smart.html Leave a comment if possible. Thank You!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nope, college is a waste of time for many.

I&#039;d say that in many ways, a lot of people could start their first &#039;white collar&#039; stint, straight out of h.s. What college does is provide that extra adolescence plus a bit of the old resume polish but that&#039;s about it except for perhaps a six year BA-MD program where the end result is being in a top profession.

Likewise, for b-ball, it provides a framework to extend adolescence but w/ a full scholarship and some coaching. Now, here&#039;s the problem, an NBA career is really a under 35 years old game. One really can&#039;t waste those years between 18 and 22, playing for free, esp if a monied position is in the wings. So now, we&#039;re looking at an alternate world where the career starts at 18 but has the potential for a full 17 to 20 year run which is more than enough, for most people. Afterwards, it&#039;s probably not a bad idea to try something different (i.e. coaching or media announcer) for some variety in one&#039;s career or ride the pine at veteran&#039;s minimum till 46 like Parish for the &#039;97 Bulls.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On the flip side to Oden&#039;s injury...look at Shaun Livingston.  

It&#039;s hard to see the effects of the age limit since it has only been around for 2 years now(?).  

You can compare it to the policies of other sports such as football and see how that goes.]]></description>
