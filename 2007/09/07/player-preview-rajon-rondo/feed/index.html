		<description><![CDATA[For all you haters a few years ago...let&#039;s see how accurate I was.

His final numbers:

29.9 MIN, 10.6 PTS, 5.1 AST, 4.2 REB, 1.7 STL

So, I was a little low on points and rebounds...but I definitely nailed it on the head. Just thought I&#039;d say I told ya so!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I also must say I think Rondo can be like a Tony parker-type...not a Jason Kidd-type. Wake me up when 6&#039;1&quot; Rondo grabs 6.5 rebounds... what about Pierce, KG, Perk and any big man?

FYI Tony Parker had just 5.5 assists and he&#039;s a seasoned veteran. While I agree the Spurts offense is run different, I don&#039;t believe that Rondo is going to be the focal point of the C&#039;s offense. That would be way too much pressure, and why would they put it on him? they have THREE superstars to shoulder the load. His job is to just carry the ball up, set the offense initially, and pass the ball. Some shooting, little rebounding required (any extra is a bonus).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK. Rondo is not Jason Kidd. maybe I was a little off with the rebound total...but I wouldn&#039;t expect more than four. and steals? so he&#039;s the next Baron Davis, huh? i think 1.75 may be a little low...but fine how about 1.9? what&#039;s the difference? More than 5.3 assists? So you guys think that Rondo will score 10-12? Why would he need to score? He can&#039;t shoot so well.

I&#039;m not a Rondo-hater, i&#039;m just a realist. I&#039;d love for him to score 10-12 and dish out 6 or more assists...and if he does its an auto-NBA Finals berth for the Celtics.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Look for rondo to go all 90 ft enough to average 10-12 pts pergame with assist around 6-8 pergame Oposing teams will have to play strong defense on the 3 all-stars thus romdo to the Rim. his man can layback if he wants but rondo has the speed and skills to get past him to to have a shot at the rim or to dish to an open player downlow or outside. He is going to make this season a fun Celtic season. Tommy will love him more than walter.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No way Rondo has that bad of numbers this year after playing 32 minutes a game!! Look at what he started doing at the end of the year. You can&#039;t factor in what he did in the very beginning as a rookie who got very little playing time. Just looking post ASB he scored 8 pt, got 4.9 rebounds, 4.5 assists, averaged 2.06 steals, and had a FG% of 43% in about 30 minutes a game. And in the very last month where the job was all his, he played 36.9 minutes a game and got 13.6 pts, 5.8 rebounds, 5.5 assists, 2.5 steals, had a FG% of .55 and shot .72 from the free-throw line.

I say look for more minutes played, more points, more steals, and more rebounds then your projections. And probably more assists because assist totals go up a lot with experience and better players around you. Rondo has both.]]></description>
