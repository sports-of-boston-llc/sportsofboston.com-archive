		<description><![CDATA[if you look at kg ray and pierce all 3 had their best/most productive (efficiency, PER, player wins produced, best numbers)seasons on the best team they were on. (honestly looking most at wins produced stat for them, and Player efficiency rating, and WP48)

KG in 2004 (won mvp led team to confernece finals), Ray in 2001 (allnba 3rd, led team to conference finals), and pierce in 02 (allnba 3rd, led team to conference finals).... so I think this year may be their best year yet considering it is the best and most talented team they are on. and like the man said they complement each other so perfectly on the court,and are team players that dominate within the flow of the team and the game, dont force nothing and make the right plays.... theyre gonna be AMAZING

ps- I know ray got 2nd team allnba in 05 but he was actually much more productive in those numbers (per, player wins produced) in 01. And I know some people say different years were the best numbers for Ray and Paul (kevins mvp is undisputed his best numbers across the board), but really their most productive and best years were CLEARLY on their most successful/best teams (ray  in 01, paul in 02) and were most efficient  and they produced their most wins by far.


For the fg% i agree with you Dan they could each get career highs in FG% this year, they take good shots and make the right plays on top of opening the floor for each other so much.... complement each others games so well from their positions. Theyre gonna be great, its a fair prediction/hypothesis as well that all 3 could have career years this year in terms of production overall. (not saying most points scored, just saying their best year this year)....... gonna be a SPECIAL team around these core 3 star players for the next 4 or 5 years. I cant wait for this season!!! Green 17 baby, go celts!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you need some shot% in these projections. Pierce from 2005 to 2007 has had a .455, .471, and .439 FG%. Now .471% was the highest of his career and .455 was the second highest. And his .439 is the 7th, if you break down the % even more. How will the new guys effect his shot selection?
And his .389% from 3PT range was the 3rd highest of his career. Will he get more open shots from outside? Less? And will his 3PT% go up?

I wanna know.]]></description>
