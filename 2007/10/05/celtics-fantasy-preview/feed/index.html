		<description><![CDATA[First off let me say I HATE BOSTON and the celtics (hate the sox more but still), but Honestly if you dont think this team is gonna dominate you are either lying to yourself or know NOTHING about basketball. I hate Boston but they would be an elite team out west up there among phx and utah and them, theyre gonna be a POWER in the east. You couldnt get another combo of 3 superstars that fit together so perfect in every way on the court and in terms of character selflessness and leadership.


People severely underrate their depth . Not to mention Rondo and Perkins that are legit 1 and 5&#039;s and are much better than people make them out to be and a perfect fit in their lineup around the core 3 superstars. They got the defensive coach as their assistant that guy thibodeau that organized the old knicks defense and more recently the rockets defense of the past 3 seasons and great defensive players so you already knew theyd be scoring bigtime but their defense is also gonna be powerful. Not only that but on their depth the great teams in this league are 8-10 men deep in their rotation, the Celtics HAVE that. They have proven veteran roleplayers like James Posey, Eddie House, Scalabrine, Dante Jones and Pollard, and also have very good young guys like Tony Allen, Leon Powe, Rondo and Kendrick Perkins. People say injuries but look at any team even the spurs would be killed by an injured star player when it comes to title hopes. The suns have been a 7 man rotation for 3 years and theyve been a powerhouse. The heat in the first year with shaq had MUCH WORSE DEPTH and had the equivalent to eddie house as their STARTING pointguard in Damon Jones, they had holes in 3/5th&#039;s of their lineup and no good bench guys(unless you consider michael doleac and rasual butler good bench guys) and they won 59 games and were 1 win from the finals (and a wade injury away from winning the title in my opinon).  The celtics are SET for a rotation which seemed impossible after the very late garnett trade, but its the truth, they are loaded with one of the best starting 5s in the nba (and thee best trio)and do have depth for a very good rotation overall.


Their GM did a very good job of filling out the roster with proven veteran roleplayers and some good young talent around the core 3 A+ all-nba guys in limited time for a great run with a possible title if things go right. But more importantly he made all the right moves and didnt make any panic/stupid moves which set himself up perfect to fill out the roster in his first full summer next offseason to LOAD UP for a SERIOIUS title run. 

I hate boston, but I am happy for Ray Allen and KG and even Pierce. And this team is the nearly sole reason that I have purchased league pass for the first time EVER in over 25 years of diehard NBA fandom. Theyre gonna be a POWERHOUSE this year and a special team for the next 3 or 4 years and may win the whole thing not just the east.]]></description>
