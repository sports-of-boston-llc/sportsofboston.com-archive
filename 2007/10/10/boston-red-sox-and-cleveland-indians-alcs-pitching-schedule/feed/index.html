		<description><![CDATA[True that Valentine. Considering how much better Matsuzaka does after 5 days rest you could argue for the schedule to be changed.

After 5 days rest Dice-K is 9-4 with a 3.83 ERA and with 4 days rest he&#039;s 5-7 with a 5.29 ERA.

My main goal in making the schedule was to avoid allowing Wakefield to start, getting Beckett in three times, and getting pitchers rest. Wakefield scares me because if he&#039;s not on his game he can blow it all up. 

Wakefield has had a bad second half with a 5.77 ERA and in the month of September he had a 8.20 ERA. But refering back to how a pitcher does after rest, after 6  days rest career wise Wakefield has a 3.94 ERA in 55 games. I still wouldn&#039;t be optimistic about his start. 

The Red Sox got Dice-K because he was a big game pitcher. So he needs a chance to be one. I&#039;d fit Dice in for two start. 

I&#039;m still sticking with:
Beckett, Schilling, Matsuzaka, Beckett, Schilling, Matsuzaka, Beckett]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two thoughts to add...

(1) If Beckett pitches game 4 on short rest, he will need to be restricted in both games 1 and 4.  Recent history is filled with excellent pitchers who were not able to bounce back effectively.  Very few lasted more than five innings in the second game.

(2) Matsuzaka has pitched poorly on normal rest this year (what you are calling &quot;five days rest&quot; is commonly referred to as &quot;four days rest&quot; in the pitching splits -- see baseball-reference.com).  He has pitched very well when he gets an extra day between starts, as he did in Japan.  Pitching him in games 3/7 allows that extra day of rest.  Pitching him in games 3/6 does not.

One alternative would be to pitch:
Beckett, Schilling, Matsuzaka, Beckett, Schilling, Wakefield, Beckett
