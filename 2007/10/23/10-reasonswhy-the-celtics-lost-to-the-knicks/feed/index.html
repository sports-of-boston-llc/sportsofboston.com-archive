		<description><![CDATA[Steve - nice enthusiasm. I agree with just about everything you said

Frankie G - Yeah that&#039;s as big as we got that game. We were missing Perk (6&#039;10&quot;) and Pollard (6&#039;11&quot;), but I really think this team could get taller by adding a backup big man (PJ Brown anybody?). Only problem is that adding another player would have to be a veteran minimum deal because we are at or right near the salary cap for the season.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The only problem and only reason we lost to the knicks was the lack of perk (besides of course that the knicks were out for revenge playing like a playoff game and the celts werent trying until midway thru the third quarter). KG can only lock down on one of those 300 pounders, perk or at least pollard is NEEDED to lock down on the other.On offense it doesnt matter much because KG dominates down low anyways, but having Perk to pass to for a dunk when his man leaves him is much better than scal at the 3 point line, although scal does pull the big out and give more room to work, kind of. Kind of because Perk is running around setting screens and doesnt get in the way of KG operating down low, in a single coverage KG scores 9 out of 10 times, and if the double comes he finds the open man every time. Seriously though, The knicks played for revenge, and went up by as much as 20 points, and then the Celtics began trying and cut it down to a 2 point lead in less than 12 minutes.



All in all its preseason, and the team is a GREAT team, theyre basically a western powerhouse dropped out east into the titanic division. (Im not a boston fan, I dont like boston, but I did get league pass to watch this team), Theyre gonna be a powerhouse, its hilarious that some of you are actually nervous. I will admit that the only reason there would be to be nervous is if indeed Perk and Pollard both are out. Otherwise the Knicks have no chance even if they do play twice as hard. Prepare to win the East, at least Boston. And jeesh, be happy for once. This is the celtics, the winningest franchise in NBA history, the quintessential champion, and they just landed the best 7 footer in the league besides Tim Duncan and put the best team around him that he has ever had, with a core of 2 superstars and he&#039;s never even had 1 to play with. They are LOADED, and they are BACK, as they should be, its the celtics. Not the redsox, be happy and be a CELTIC fan, that means arrogant and knowing its a matter of time til youre in the finals. Which IS the truth, look at your team and then look at the east, you know its the truth.]]></description>
