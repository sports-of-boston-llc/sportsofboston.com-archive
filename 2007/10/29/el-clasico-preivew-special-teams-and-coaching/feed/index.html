		<description><![CDATA[I agree with everything, except I&#039;d have to say that Dungy is rated. He&#039;s been held in high regard for his good natured self for years. As far as coaching, he&#039;s very good and I don&#039;t think he flies under the radar. I think the Bucs underrated him when they fired him, but there is a reason the Colts snagged him right away. (probably because of Jim Mora too...Playoffs!?!??!)]]></description>
