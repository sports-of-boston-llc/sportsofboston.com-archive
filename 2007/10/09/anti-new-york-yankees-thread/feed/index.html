		<description><![CDATA[I know, I&#039;m a virgin to posting on this site, so I figure I would pop my cherry with this post. 

You can&#039;t assume the Red Sox would benefit with spending 52 million more dollars because look at their latest free agent acquistions: Drew, Lugo, Dice-K, even the Gagne salary they took on. That&#039;s a lot of money right there and granted those guys have shown signs of life, but you can&#039;t say that any of them have proved that they are worth their contracts. While I do believe Dice-K will be solid over the next few  years and will end up earning his salary. You can&#039;t deny that Lugo and Drew were major dissapointments this year, which just goes to show you that money doesn&#039;t guarantee success. I truly believe the Red Sox would be just as good as they are now without Drew and Lugo. In fact, they might even be better with Ellsbury guaranteed a spot and Alex Cora bunting people over in a close game. 

As far as the Yankees Off-season, while there is a good chance Torre will not be asked back, you never really know. I&#039;d say there is a 30% chance he returns and in New York that maybe just enough. If Torre goes, Donnie or Giaradi will replace him, NOT La Russa. Steinbrenner wants a guy he can&#039;t hold to for years not a girly man like La Russa with a massive ego. I would actually hope for Giaradi, I like his style and we have a lot of young kids who are expected to grow up fast.

As for the players:
Rivera: will return even without Torre
Posada: Ditto
Pettitte: I believe will return for the option and may even more after next year.
Abreu: 50-50 chance his option isn&#039;t picked up right now, in the end I think it&#039;ll be easier to have on for one more year and see his true worth
AROD: Maybe I&#039;m just being optimistic, but I believe the possible greatest player in the history of the game is now focusing on his legacy and knows if he moves on to another team, he won&#039;t have his jersey retired any where. Hence, Yanks offer a big extsension before he opts out, he takes the big extension that will probably be backloaded so it won&#039;t look as big as it actually is and Arod will look like he took a home=town discount, when he didn&#039;t.
Bengie: I hope we bring him back, he was a solid back up.
Clemens: Is Done, finally.

Overall, I actually think the Yankees will be a better team next year if they keep the same players. Wang has the stuff of a great number 3 starter, Hughes has the stuff of an ace and could very well have a Verlander like year, next year. Ian Kennedy has the stuff of a number 2, he looked damn good in September and next year would only be a number 4 or 5 with Pettitte holding up the rotation. Let&#039;s not forget Joba, who will be in the rotation next year unless they pull a Papelbon, however I don&#039;t think they will with Humberto Sanchez coming back from surgery this year and filling in that role. Mussina as a number 5 isnt horrible, considering Alan Horne is waiting in the minors for his call-up, supposingly he has as good of stuff, if not better stuff than Joba and Kennedy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What I don&#039;t get is when Boston fans complain about the disparity for team salaries.  Like you said, the Yankees are first, the Red Sox are second.  That just means that the Red Sox are not as &quot;good&quot; as the Yankees when it comes to throwing money at the players.  I&#039;m sure the Red Sox can easily be first in payroll since they have the revenue to do it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A-Rod wont stay. As the deal stands, the Rangers are paying a HUGE chunk of his remaining salary. The Yankees are paying A-Rod $16 million in 2007 and 2008, $17 million in 2009, and $18 million in 2010. NOW, they&#039;ll have to nearly double what they owe him. 30-plus million for another 8-10 years. he wouldn&#039;t accept 5 years because he&#039;s A-Rod and he has Scott Boras -- they don&#039;t have to. A-rod is that good...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s my predictions:
Torre - out, Mattingly or Girardi in
Clemens - done, for good this time. Can&#039;t keep it up physically
Rivera - tough, but he&#039;ll be back, they&#039;ll give him a big offer
Posada - same deal, they need him, and have few options in the organization (Sal Fasano maybe??)
Abreu- def back. I think they have a one year option and they&#039;ll def pick it up.
Pettitte - I think he&#039;s gonna retire. Without roger or torre there, he&#039;ll be ready to move on.
AROD - STAYS. He&#039;ll opt out and get a 5 year, $150 mil contract. Despite his inconsistancies in the playoffs, the thought of starting over again could stop him. The fact that he&#039;ll play for the most storied franchise ever with the stands always filled, and the thoughts of glory perhaps making the new yanks stadium &quot;The House that Arod Built&quot; will keep him in NY. A lot of it will be about money and with Roger gone and Giambi&#039;s money gone after next year they&#039;ll actually have some financial flexibility.]]></description>
