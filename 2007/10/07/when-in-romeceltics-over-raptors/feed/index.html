		<description><![CDATA[KG was so DOMINANT in the low-post,  .pretty much unstoppable down there, on the other end him and perk shut the paint down, terrific passer too, he opens up everything. 7 Foot anchor on both ends, terrific.


Ray and Paul are great passers too, all 3 have great character and different types but great leadership. 3 team players, Vintage Pierce that game dominated a stretch and looked great slashing and attacking the hoop while keepin the defense true due to his outside shot. Ray missed his outside shots (looked to be thrown off being that open for the first time in over 10 years), but looked great on his drives to the hoop and finishes as well as his passing and playmaking. Rondo hit his outside shots and looked good, and Eddie House looked great at backup Pointguard. Posey and T Allen played good Defense and Scal did too, the bench is very underrated and the whole team looked very good on defense from mid2nd quarter on. They looked great, gonna be a powerhouse and should be a SPECIAL team for the next 4 or so years.]]></description>
