		<description><![CDATA[I agree and i don&#039;t think a knuckler can be a good a reliever unless he&#039;s in the long relief when everything is loss. I might be more encline to trade Lester then Bucholz but then, again, do the Sox wants to pony up 20 millions per for Santana? It might be a reality if Lowell doesn&#039;t re-sign...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The rotation probably wouldn&#039;t include one if Lester got traded. If Lester was traded with others to get Santana then Buchholz would probably be in the bullpen to start the year. The thing is Wakefield in the bullpen and Buchholz starting could be bad on both ends. Wakefield starting and Buchholz in relief would probably be a stronger fit.

Plus I don&#039;t think Wakefield wants to go back to the bullpen to round out the end of his career.]]></description>
