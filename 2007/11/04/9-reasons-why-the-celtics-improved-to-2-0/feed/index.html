		<description><![CDATA[I think Rondo had a off offensive game but his D appeared decent, he will need to step his game in order for Boston to be successful this season I believe he will be the determining factor on how they do this season. I personally always leave it  to Vegas to determine the real probabilities of something occurring,  right now the odds have the Celtics at 10/1 to win it allWWW.Wagerweb.com &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wagerweb.com/sports-betting-line/nba-odds.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; NBA Lines &lt;/a&gt; so that is a bad omen for them]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK. perhaps I undervalued T.J. Ford, I&#039;ll give him more credit for almost beating us, but still. he did make Rondo look foolish. In fact, at the end of the game he made Pierce look foolish. I&#039;d say T.J. Ford is top-10 when healthy, Rondo&#039;s just not in his league. Not yet at least...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I gotta disagree partially with your Rondo complaint. Offensively, yes I agree. But watching the first half of that game, T.J. Ford is a top 5 or six point guard when it comes to scoring. Jason Kidd isn&#039;t a scoring threat, but Ford right now is the quickest PG in the NBA. He jacked up a lot of shots, but Rondo is probably the best PG defender in the league when it comes to quickness and Ford STILL drove by him. And you have to remember, with two quick fouls and foul trouble for the whole game, he wasn&#039;t able to be nearly as physical as he usually will.]]></description>
