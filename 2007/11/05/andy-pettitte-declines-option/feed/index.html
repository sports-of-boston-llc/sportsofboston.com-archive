		<description><![CDATA[I consider Beckett, Dice-K and Wakefield proven because they are what they are. Beckett is great. Dice-K is good with a chance of great. Wakefield is an innings eater.

Pettitte was one of the Yankees best pitchers last year. 15-9 with a 4.05 ERA and always a strong performance in the clutch.

Mussina I say is done. He&#039;s 39 and 3 of the last 4 years he&#039;s had a 4.41 ERA or higher. And last year he had a 5.15 ERA. And like any Yankees he still had a winning record at 11-10. Same reason why Wang comes close to 20 wins.

With the Red Sox I still don&#039;t know what will come of the off-season. Lester and Buchholz could be 4-5 and both suck. Or Schilling could be back and Buchholz works in the minors till someone gets hurt. But having a clear ace in Beckett and Dice-K who I think will break out, is a good start to a staff.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think most Yankees fans were hoping for Pettitte&#039;s return, but it won&#039;t make or break the season. 

Since when is Mike Mussina not a proven pitcher? He&#039;s a shell of his former self but i wouldn&#039;t say he&#039;s dead weight.

And I&#039;d watch out with overlooking Joba, Hughes and Kennedy. If the Sox don&#039;t resign Schilling (who I see a the Red Sox version of Pettitte), they&#039;ll be looking at a rotation including &quot;unproven&quot; starters bucholtz and lester. Yea buchotlz threw a no-no but he&#039;s not a proven major league pitcher. Don&#039;t forget, Phil Hughes was pitching a no-no in HIS second start against the twins before gettin hurt.]]></description>
