		<description><![CDATA[But have you seen the before / after pictures of Cabrera?  We sure know he&#039;s not taking steroids...more like Big Mac injections...

He&#039;s good now but as KC said, &quot;is fat and lazy...&quot;
Is that someone you want 5 years from now?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[He could be moved in the near future but you could move Youkilis to 3rd and keep Miquel Cabrera at 1st or LF. And he doesn&#039;t really need anybody. He&#039;s one of the best hitters in baseball. Comparatively to A-Rod when he was 24 Cabrera is just as good a player if not better.

And Cabrera has been to a World Series before. And everything up to the actual World Series he did very well. And if it was between Cabrera and A-Rod playoff wise, A-Rod gets no edge. 

And I dont see Cabrera being a bad clubhouse influence, especially if he joins the Red Sox. He&#039;d be winning, rich with a new deal, and would have a bunch of dominican teamates like Mr. Friendly Ortiz.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cabrera is a great player, but he&#039;s lazy, fat, and a bad clubhouse influence. He needs a vet to get him on his game. If he came to Boston he may fall and fall hard under the pressure of the city and media. Id say Lowell, A-Rod, or bust.]]></description>
