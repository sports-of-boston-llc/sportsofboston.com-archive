		<description><![CDATA[Theo has said the rumor of the Sox wanting A-Rod to play SS was falsified.

Dustin I&#039;d say 10-15 homers. Almost every homerun he hit was because someone threw him a high fastball he could catch up to. Pitchers are going to avoid throwing anything high to Pedroia anymore, so he&#039;ll have to come up with HR power other ways.

Moss and Lowrie might not see much time next year because it would be better to get them experience down in AAA and have a solid veteran as a bench guy. That said, I expect them to have a part in the Red Sox near future.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In response to the comment from ALBERT NICKERSON. The idea to sign Lowell, and then acquire A-Rod to play short, sounds great in theory, but do you know how hard it would be to sign the 2 best 3rd basemen on the market, both to the same team. Some team out there would not allow that, not to mention, that&#039;s exactly what i hated about the Yankees the past 7 years, they would sign players just because they were the biggest name available, even if they had that players position filled.    
    I think signing Lowell is crucial, i hope he accepts the 3 year 12-15 mil per deal the Sox offered. Once that&#039;s done, forget Rodriguez, let him sit out there asking for 350 million, and let him wait, i only hope teams continue to scoff at that number. Next, as much as i grew to love him, shop Coco, unload his salary (not that it&#039;s huge), but unload it non the less, and try and acquire some pitching or bench help. As far as Lugo goes, forget trading him, he is our SS for next year, period. But ya know what, i wouldn&#039;t be upset about that, he will be much, much better next year i guarantee that. Trading him would require the Sox to eat a fair portion of his salary, and without the certainty of acquiring a much better SS it makes no sense, he will be just fine next season. 
      My final move would not be a trade or free agent signing at all, it would be simply making sure that this offseason Dice-K, Ellsbury, Pedroia, Okajima, Bucholz, and even some of the PawSox guys like Jed Lowrie, and Brandon Moss, get fully prepaired to come out next season even better than they were in &#039;07. I expect Moss and Lowrie to valuable assets off the bench next year, so i think we could potentially have 6, 7, even 8 rookies or 2nd year players on the roster at a time.
      The Sox will be a force once again in &#039;08, in fact i think they will be significantly better, with the improvement of Lugo, Drew, Dice-K, and believe it or not i expect 15-18 HR&#039;s out of Dustin next year, he knows how to swing that club, us 5&#039;8&quot; guys gotta stick together. :) Expect a very tough &#039;08 Red Sox club, potential 100 win team.
