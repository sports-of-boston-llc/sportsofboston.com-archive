		<description><![CDATA[Of course the Sox were left off the report. Mitchell is the team director. only a complete moron would put any stock into the Sox being left off the report. Obviously Nomar is guilty, as is Mike Lowell, Big Poppy (duh), Varitek, Nixon, and probably a dozen other guys. Just look at who Mitchell interviewed and you acn see he had an agenda.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nomar was a juicer for sure. (Nothing against him). He was HUGE when he was on the SI cover, then came back shrunken, and was never the same. Those injuries are a tell-tale sign of usage. (Hammies, pulls, tendons, etc.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[WEEI never actually read their rumored list until WNBC posted it on their website.  WEEI tried to verify the list that was sent to them and the source would not confirm it so they elected not to read it on the air.  Once Dale and Holley saw the list on WNBC, they read the list assuming that NBC did their research, which apparently they did not.  I would like to know who came up with the original list, which included Trot, Nomar, Tek, Tavares, and El Guapo.  That list got around the internet a lot, and none of those names were in the actual report.  Keep in mind that Selig got the official report 3 days ago.  You have to wonder if he made edits before it was released.  For the record, I never thought Tek was guilty.]]></description>
