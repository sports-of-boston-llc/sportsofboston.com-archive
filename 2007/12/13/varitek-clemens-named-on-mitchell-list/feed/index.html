		<description><![CDATA[VARITEK IS NOT ON THE LIST!  

Neither is Nixon or Damon or many other players who were leaked in earlier reports.  I just downloaded the enitre pdf file from MLB.com and did a search for Tek especially.  HE IS NOT LISTED!  

Please let other people know...no one needs to get a bad rap for hear say and rumors...especially someone as respectable as Mr. Varitek.]]></description>
