		<description><![CDATA[Every time I saw Billups after he left the Celts, all I can think about was &quot;Pitino!!&quot; I can&#039;t watch him making a shot without thinking about him.

Understandably about the above post and the style of Detroit, but we lacked a decent ball-control guard for probably 7 years, and Billups could&#039;ve cured enough of it that we could&#039;ve used our guard drafts for bigger players.

Pitino!!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ha you&#039;re right, Rip Hamilton is terrible, what a bad deal that was. 

I&#039;m not saying he didn&#039;t give up too early on him, because you should never trade the No. 3 overall pick for at least two years.

But hindsight is 20/20. It took him five years to average more than 16 points a game and in his first four years he never averaged more than 4 assists a game...that&#039;s Telfiar bad! 

Rip scored 20 points a game that year and along with Ben Wallace (7 points, 15 boards, 3 blocks a game) and they played stellar defense (allowing less than 90 points a game and leading the league in defensive boards and 5th best in scoring D) which led them to the eastern conference finals. Billups finally was playing the style he&#039;s best suited for, a tight offensive set with tough interior defense.

Until this year the Celtics have never concentrated on defense. The year they went to the eastern conference finals? Let up 94 points a game in the regular season.

Would we do that trade now? Of course not. Kenny Anderson was a 28 year old seasoned PG who had averaged at least 15 points a game for the last seven years. 

Again, you have to hold on to draft picks longer than 40 some odd games, but Billups has succeeded in large part because of the players he has around him and the style and PHILOSOPHY in Detriot.

I think it&#039;s a little naive to think that if we dont make that trade that the Celts would now have the Billups he is with the Pistons.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I beg to disagree. I&#039;m not saying that Billups was the greatest player ever and would&#039;ve led us to a title...but we have not come close to having a good consistent point guard until now with Rajon Rondo. Before Billups, our best potential PG was Dana Barros, so Billups was a good pick, but a bad trade. Kenny Anderson was not what we needed on a young team.

When he joined the Pistons they weren&#039;t amazing. They had just had their first 50-win season in awhile, and Joe Dumars just traded the francise (Jerry Stackhouse) for Rip Hamilton. It was a team in transition, and they all gelled right away. Rip, Chauncey, and Ben Wallace were there and they are perfect for each other. 

In all, I think Pitino gave up WAY too early on Chauncey Billups. I dont know if theres an argument there...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gotta disagree with you here. It&#039;s true that Pitino gave up on his #3 pick overall way too early, but it took YEARS for Billups to develop into the player he is now. Stops in Minnesota and Denver yielded very unimpressive results. Five years in his best season was 12 PPG and 5 APG, if he was in Boston we would have screamed at Pitino for drafting a bust. 

Then he goes to Detroit and with great players around him becomes a superstar.

I think it&#039;s a little hasty to feel that if Billups was on the Celts that they would have eventually won a title or something. He&#039;s an amazing player but it took five years and four teams to get there.]]></description>
