		<description><![CDATA[Not so sure about that Xmotha, the Celtics rested KG/Pierce for most of the game. Allen had significant minutes and Glen Davis stepped up. Either way, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a fair comparison to say the Celtics would have lost given Lebron playing; it would have a been a completely different game.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh come on Jeff, the Celtics played bad. Bad is bad. No excuses. You are how you play. If Lebron was playing last night the Celtics would have lost.

LeBron is Garnett to the Celtics. Without him the team is MUCH different.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m going to disagree a little. Sure the final score wasn&#039;t a sexy blowout, but considering the Cavs scored a bunch of points in garbage time and Garnett played just terrible offensively (2-12 from the field in only 26 minutes played). The crowd wasn&#039;t much of a factor but that can&#039;t be surprising when they show up to an unusual start time of 12:30 pm on Sunday and there&#039;s no Lebron in the lineup. 

The Celts know they can play better but Sunday it was just one of those games, win and move on. Gotta love the play of Glen Davis!]]></description>
