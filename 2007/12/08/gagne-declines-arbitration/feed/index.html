		<description><![CDATA[Gagne is still a good reliever. He had a tough ride here but you can&#039;t forget he had a 2.26 ERA in Texas over 33.1 innings. And has a career as being one of the best closers ever. The Red Sox offered him arbitration because they knew he would get a better offer elsewhere.

Good luck to him.]]></description>
