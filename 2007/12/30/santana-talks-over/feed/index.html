		<description><![CDATA[Couple more points.

The Mets and Twins right now arn&#039;t even talking about Reyes because Minaya has said no way he is trading him. But the Twins have said no way they are trading Santana without Reyes. But the deals continue to go. The current offer would be a 4 player deal centered around center fielder Carlos Gomez. But the talks are still far apart.

And as far as Eric Bedard goes, there have been zero to no talks. Baltimore most likely would not give him to another AL East team even if the East offered a better deal. The Orioles are a very tight team and stick to their guns. Its looking a lot more likely that Seattle will land him with some kind of deal centered around CF Adam Jones.  

Last thing is 6 years and 150 million is a ton when he is looking for 7 years at not much more then 140. If Johan Santana opened up a 72 hour negotiation window with Boston most likely he would want to sign here and wouldn&#039;t press having more then 20 million a year. Seven years and 140 million would be the deal I see getting done. After all Johan and the Twins would have already made a deal if it wern&#039;t for the years, but he was comfortable making about 19-20 million a year.]]></description>
