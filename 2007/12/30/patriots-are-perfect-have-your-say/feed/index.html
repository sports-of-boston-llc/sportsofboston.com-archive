		<description><![CDATA[They may be the best ever, but they will never truly get the credit they deserve outside of New England. 

You take a hated WR in Randy Moss, add him to a QB fans hate to love in Tom Brady and add him to a coach fans love to hate in Bill Belichick, sprinkle a lil Spygate on it and top it off with &quot;running up the score&quot; and you get a star-studded sundae otherwise known as the best team of all-time, possibly most hated team in NFL history.

Non-Pats fans will always look to Spygate to absolve the Patriots of their great achievements. It&#039;s sad that something all teams try to do (spy via videotaping) will forever be held over this team&#039;s head and one of the greatest coaches in history, Bill Belichick.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If they win it all, it has to be considered the greatest team and greatest season in NFL history. 19-0 has never been done. The Pats offense scored the most points of all time, had the largest point differential of all time, Tom Brady was the first QB to 50 TD&#039;s in one season, and Randy Moss was the first WR to get 23 TD receptions in one season. All the records and a Superbowl victory? Best team of all time, no doubt.]]></description>
