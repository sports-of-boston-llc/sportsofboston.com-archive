		<description><![CDATA[Can someone tell me where in Boston I can purchase the Red Sox 500 piece puzzle of the front page of The Boston Globe which shows the picture of the Red Sox as they won the series?   The Globe Store can&#039;t promise delivery by Christmas, and I would like to get my son one - as he is a huge Red Sox fan.   On second thought so am I -  maybe I&#039;ll keep it for myself!

THanks!]]></description>
