		<description><![CDATA[The Pats have nothing to be ashamed of. This Ravens team went 13-3 last year and have some of the best defensive players in the league. Add to the fact that the Ravens were fighting for a slim playoff chance and were at home on Monday night while the Pats have virtually locked up home field throughout the playoffs.
As far as the penalties they were questionable on both sides. The facemask against the Ravens in the first quarter was one of the most vicious I have seen in Football and should have resulted in ejection and/or fines.
And by the way the Ravens came into the game as the second most penalized team in the league and played like it !]]></description>
