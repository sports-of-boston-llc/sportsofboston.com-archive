		<description><![CDATA[I can see this record continuing this week but we will learn a lot more next week when they face the Raptors, Pistons, Bulls and Magic. Orlando are one of the two teams to inflict defeat on the Celtics in a 104-102 thriller after the Magic had opened up a 20 point lead. WInning the conference has to be the no.1 target and the Magic are one of the contenders that need to be accounted for.  San Antonio, Utah, Dallas and Phoenix have to be overcome and the Celtics have not crossed swords with them yet. I doubt 73-9 is achievable but beating the 67-15 record of the &#039;86 title winning Celtics is in range.]]></description>
