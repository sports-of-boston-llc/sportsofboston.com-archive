		<description><![CDATA[Ref: * How come Tuukka was sick for the game against Canada in the Olympics – ooh my arm!

Correction.  Rask played against Canada, &#038; Finland lost 2-1 in OT.  By far, that was the closest a juggernaut Canadian came to losing in the Olympics.  Rask didn&#039;t play in the Medal round semi-finals vs Swededen because he was sick.  He did return for Bronze Medal game &#038; beat the US team 5-0.  Earlier, Rask &#038; Finland beat Russia 3-1.  Overall, Rask finished 3-1 with a .938 save percentage and 1.73 goals-against average in the four games.  I think that&#039;s pretty good.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[David, that sounds ridiculous, I agree. Maybe in some, even many, instances the &quot;PC Police&quot; can be out of control. But even the proverbial stopped clock is right twice a day, and every case should be considered separately. The Arkansas situation has nothing to do with an NFL team slurring an ethnic group.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Napoli had that ugly finger issue in Chicago, he&#039;ll bounce back next year. 

It looks it will be another rough night for NE tonight. They need to stay away from 3rd and long. Draws and screens can slow down a pass rush. Arrowhead has a college atmosphere. 

Will Weis surface in NE this year?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the point that Michael is making is that the PC police are out of control and have been for quite some time.  They will complain about so many things that rarely make sense.  You can&#039;t assign reason or logic to the PC police - and if you feel as if you can, then this is a waste of time.

Just 2 weeks ago Arkansas State had to remove small logos from the back of their helmets that honored a teammate and a manager that died because their initials were in the shape of a cross.

Some peckerhead that is not a student, alumnus, or in any way affiliated with the school was offended and the school caves...that&#039;s an example of the crap I think he was referring to.]]></description>
