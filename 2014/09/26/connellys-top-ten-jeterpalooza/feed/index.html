		<description><![CDATA[Any 1976 offensive line would get crushed in todays football.  Everyone is bigger and stronger now.  Pat&#039;s mediocre o line would own everyone in the 70s.

REPLY - MPC - Are you going to tell me that Hannah, Gray and Lenkiatis wouldn&#039;t get it done better than the current left side?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Too early to say if Castillo is a bust. Knee jerk reaction by you. 

Arkansas has the biggest OL and that includes the NFL. Do the Razorbacks have enough on defense to slow down Hill (father went to Lynn Classical) and that high powered offense? 

Will Sumlin coach in the NFL next year? 

UCLA looked great last night. 

Jeter scored 1923 runs in his career, and in 1923 the Yankees won their first title, Read that last night, thought I would share that with you. 

Top five pick for the Red Sox in June.

REPLY - MPC - I think Arkansas is going to punish people and although Sumlin is high octane I think they wear done A&#038;Mdefense / Castillo might be OK 18 HR / 270 hitter but he has already proven he is no 5 tool player]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your really writing off Rusney Castillo after about 10 MLB games? C&#039;mon man!

REPLY - MPC - I&#039;m just saying after seeing him swing at curve balls like Michael Jordan, throw like an average double a player and run like an average outfielder that the five tool thing was a miss]]></description>
