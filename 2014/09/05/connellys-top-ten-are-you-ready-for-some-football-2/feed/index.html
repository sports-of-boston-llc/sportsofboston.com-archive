		<description><![CDATA[Which version of Invincible? Roth or Wahlberg?

Hope Pats run the ball well.  I agree with you on Uehara.  I really don&#039;t see how juicing effects average.

REPLY - MPC - Wahlberg / juicing moves outfielders back and balls drop in, balls are hit harder and through infields or to gaps quicker and they said Bonds eyesight improved dramatically]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[line on gronk for games played in vegas is 14.5.  what a disparity!

would take your under on brady sacks.  i&#039;m glad scarnecchia is gone.  he was overrated.  horrifically so.  his lines always threw up on themselves in massive spots the last decade after he hit a hot streak during the super bowl years.  i understand his contributions over time, and i respect that... but it was long since time for him to go.

your list on movies is OK except it&#039;s missing The Dark Knight and The Departed.  I would likely have Dallas Buyers Club on mine somewhere.  Haven&#039;t seen Cinderella Man, Michael Clayton or Intouchables but will check them all out.  Also... Night at the Museum... joke, right?!?

REPLY - MPC - Did Vegas have a gronk line / Departed got too crazy at the end / You want to rethink sack over under]]></description>
