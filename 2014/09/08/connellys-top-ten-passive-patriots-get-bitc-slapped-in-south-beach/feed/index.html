Matt Dillon, Ralph Macchio, Patrick Swayze, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, Tom Cruise, Diane Lane, Leif Garrett, C. Thomas Howell, and Sofia Coppola.  Dwight Evans should be in HOF along with Luis Tiant.

		<description><![CDATA[the line&#039;s problems were prevalent when scarnecchia was here.  they have had significant issues blocking 4 down linemen since february 08.  he couldn&#039;t figure it out, let the new guy have a shot.

that sound brady hears is the slow gong of father time... looked horrifically horrific yesterday.  one of his worst games as a patriot.  heard some crazy stat that it&#039;s first time since 06 that a QB threw downfield 15+ yards over 15 times and didn&#039;t complete a single ball.

MPC - REPLY - Is that true on that stat - crazy!]]></description>
