		<description><![CDATA[i disagree on revis.  it&#039;s the same thing as those chargers players chirping at richard sherman last week.  so, they completed like 5 passes towards revis on sunday for like 60 yards...?  that&#039;s NOT explosive, it&#039;s not going for touchdowns, and revis is still keeping everyone else in their assignments and pats aren&#039;t suffering ridiculous breakdowns in communication.

REPLY - MPC - Don&#039;t forget that receivers should have scored twice on him but dropped balls or couldn&#039;t get their feet down]]></description>
