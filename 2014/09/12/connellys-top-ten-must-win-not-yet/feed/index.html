		<description><![CDATA[I suppose most would agree with you that DeNiro&#062;Pacino, but you know those top 5 Pacino movies are much better movies than the top 5 deNiros.  Its not even close!  And Pacino was great in all of them; some he is in every scene.  DeNiro arguably has a little more range - he has done some so-so comedy - and he has stayed relevant a bit longer, but I would say that DeNiro has never been in movies as good as those Pacino pictures from the 70s.

Strong early work by these two - Bang The Drum Slowly and Panic in Needle Park

REPLY - MPC - I think that is very fair assessment and I&#039;m a huge Bang the Drum Slowly fan and the song is haunting / Raging Bull is more consuming than any Pacino movie - They both have slumped late which is too bad]]></description>
