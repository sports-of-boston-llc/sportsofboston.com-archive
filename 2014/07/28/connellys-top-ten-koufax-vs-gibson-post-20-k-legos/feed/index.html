		<description><![CDATA[Was in Tampa Monday, listening to sports talk (98.7).  Ortiz rivalry, big deal down there, lots of callers.  Also they were doing back flips about how &quot;BIG&quot; the crowd was compared to other games and how it helped them by having the big crowds.  Main reason they like big crowds is when no crowds, you can actually hear people talking in background and conversations, geez is that F&#039;d up

REPLY - MPC - MLB should take the franchise away - disgraceful and a good team with a great coach]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree the games are too long and something needs to change but eliminating the intentional walk is too superficial.  Only happens in roughly 40% of games and how much time does it actually take?  Need to get to the root cause.  Prevent exiting the batters box, put a time clock on pitchers and that would have much more impact.  Will not be done though because Selig and owners do not care about the future of the game. Just current profit. Game will be virtually dead in 20 years. Remember Digital and Polaroid were flying high once too. Things change.]]></description>
