		<description><![CDATA[basic skittles overrated.  skittles wild berry and the combo ones are addicting.

if bradley jr can finish season hitting .250ish, then the sox will have showed proper patience (finally) and found a key defensive player that can sit at end of lineup for the next 5 seasons.

REPLY - MPC - I would accept .250]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Shocked at Lewis. Always wondered why more guys don&#039;t bunt. Figure pretty easy to bunt 7/10 times, thats 700 slugging %. If getting on base 70% of the time, teams would stop shifting against you. Fine for Ted Williams to try to hit through shift, but never get why most guys dont bunt until they stop shifting. Great stat on Canseco. Can&#039;t believe he hit 52 HRs in only 198 games. Dont remember him being that good for Sox (or young, he came over at age 30) Only thing I remember about his time in Boston was O for 13 in playoffs. Skittles are properly rated

reply -mpc - jose had 24 and 28 in his two years]]></description>
