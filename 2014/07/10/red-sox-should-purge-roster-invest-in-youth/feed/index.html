		<description><![CDATA[First off, let me say I agree with the idea.  I think I would consider what are the more movable pieces...  Victorino will not be one and Doubront should be (and has to be). Along with Gomes, Napoli, Drew, Lackey, Peavy, Breslow, Badenhop, Carp and Uehara.  I&#039;d also throw in Middlebrooks and Hererra as well.  In temrs of veterans I would take by chances in free agency to plug the few holes.  The real gamble with this is you could have 2 losign seasons before you start firing on all cylinders.  Cheers]]></description>
