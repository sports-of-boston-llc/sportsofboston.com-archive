		<description><![CDATA[Throw in Koji to get rid of now, anyone who is on a contract ending this year that we cant or wont resign, should be traded,even if for a bag of balls.  This year is over!

UNC greatest, so many to add, like rasheed wallace and jerry stackhouse

Minihane is much better then Mitre perle, but if he was&#039;t there no one would notice.  Morning drive goes to EEI, mid day is a toss up depending on time of year, afternoon drive is 98.5, even though I think Felger is a DB, they do good radio, night time is &quot;land of the lost&quot; with Mikey and Adam Jones  We are fortunate in Boston to have choice on sports talk radio, best place in country for it

REPLY - MPC - I leave toward Felger despite politics - yep Koji - get anything back if you like him sign him in winter]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[are we supposed to guess what the title of the list is for stu scott&#039;s nba list?  it&#039;s some kind of UNC players list?  is it &quot;top players&quot; or just &quot;favorite players&quot;?

if it is top players... where is hansborough?!?

the only things of note i know about minihane are his rant against andrews, and his rant / fight with gary tanguay last year on CSNE that went viral overnight.  i turned off that show years ago and have never looked back.  i don&#039;t regret it.

reply-mpc - top ten tar heel players /]]></description>
