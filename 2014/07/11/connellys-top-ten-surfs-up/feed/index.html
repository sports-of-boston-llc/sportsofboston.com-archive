		<description><![CDATA[Thatta boy, El Presidente.  Lob a perjorative, present no facts or argument, dismiss anything that you disagree with as a whacky conspiracy...Saul Alinsky would be proud of you.  

Here&#039;s to hoping that the IRS takes a peak at you some day.  Even the mainstream press has now had to admit that something is very wrong there, but you and Alan should stick to your opinions.  Don&#039;t ever let pesky facts get in your way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alan,

What the crud is wrong with you?  You have such an inability to look at facts that it&#039;s scary.  You go back to the old standby
- blame Fox News.  Are you saying that this isn&#039;t a story?  Like the IRS, Benghazi, Fast and Furious - the border is a big story.  You and your progressive anti-traditionalist crowd crowd can bury your heads if you want to, but it doesn&#039;t change the facts.

You&#039;ll follow this guy off of whatever cliff he wants to lead you off.  I&#039;d love to hear your take if a conservative Republican used the IRS as his foil against people or groups that disagreed with his conservative viewpoints.

I&#039;m pretty sure that you&#039;d think that it was a big story then.  Heck - I&#039;m sure that MSNBC would be right there with you. Are you even aware that the document dump that the White House pulled on July 3rd produced some pretty damning email and instant messaging evidence from Lois Lerner?  Even Chris Matthews lost the thrill up his leg over the weekend.  A smoking gun can do that.  Apparently you haven&#039;t, though.  Do you know who Justice put in charge of the &quot;investigation&quot;?  Look it up - it&#039;s scary.

  It&#039;s no longer a secret, Alan, the mainstream press is in the tank.  Fox News tells us what&#039;s going on.  There is a reason why people are turning off the other channels.  Wake Up!

REPLY - MPC - They don&#039;t want to hear facts - it doesn&#039;t fit their argument - it will be a problem for them if it impacts them]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s all about perspective.  Sox won it all last year and between $ coming off the books next year and promising system they could be back in the mix very quickly. Count me as a happy Sox fan no matter the record this year.

REPLY - MPC - I actually have no problem with this - I would rather they have a $100mm payroll and build 25 baseball fields around Boston with their surplus]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pedroia would be the first one I&#039;d trade.  He&#039;s on the dark side of 30, his performance is in clear decline, and you&#039;ve got the best 2B prospect in baseball all ready to go.  Pull the trigger now so you won&#039;t be eating that contract in 3-4 years.  Ask yourself this:  what would Belichick do?

Also, how about Shaefer?

REPLY - MPC - I love that shaefer ad with the iced beer mug - Pedroia is more about culture than results at this time]]></description>
