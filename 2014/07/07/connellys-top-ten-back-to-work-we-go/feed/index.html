		<description><![CDATA[Not a bigger Pedroia fan out there, but he not very close to Alomar in my book. Not that All Star Games/Gold Gloves always best gauge....ALomar went to 12 straight AS games and won 11 out of 12 GGs. Pedroia presently 4/3. He was far better postseason player .313 Avg, 829 OPS vs .247 and .728. Alomar also avg 32 Steals per 162 vs 18. Alomar tailed off early (last good season at 33) so hopefully Pedroia can catch him in 2half of his career

REPLY - MPC - I agree but a lot closer than I though]]></description>
