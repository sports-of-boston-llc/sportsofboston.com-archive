		<description><![CDATA[the ball can&#039;t be advanced by the offensive team recovering the onside kick.

i went 4-4 in picks for outright wins this weekend!  2-2 if counting the spread (SEA and DEN didn&#039;t cover).

knew you would have something to say on pierce missing those buckets.  that team is horrible.  what a trade for the Cs.

can&#039;t believe this is the first road playoff game since 2006... that is an amazing fact.

reply mpc - pats insane run - surprised by that on side kick rule but if you say so]]></description>
