		<description><![CDATA[Barnard/Cady = Greatest Generation! Makes the rest of us look like sissy&#039;s. 

Hogan Stanford/Bortles UCF could end up better NFL QB&#039;s than Johnny Football. 

Like Pats, Seahawks, 49er&#039;s &#038; Chargers.

Referee Pete Morelli assigned to Pats/Colts.

Referee Pete Morelli&#039;s crew called TWO penalties during the Pats 34-31 victory over the Texans. Morelli&#039;s crew has called an average of 10.4 penalties per game. Fewest in the NFL. Source ESPN stats &#038; information. 

Footballzebras.com has tonights officiating crews for all games.

Global Warming/Climate Change is an extortion racket.

REPLY - MPC - Maybe Bortles if in right system - yes Global warming and green is a billion dollar business]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i&#039;m no global warming nut, but they point to these cold snaps and superstorms as evidence of global warming.  some hoo haa about the caps warming, and breaking off turbulent air and precipitation, which is causing some of the increased weather we have experienced in the last few decades.

the bobby petrino thing is so awesome and corrupt.  the picture of that guy at the presser when he has his neck brace on is a classic.  i have never laughed harder at a sports story.

i hate FSU... too bad auburn D couldn&#039;t even slow them down at end of game.  mason&#039;s father is DJ Maseo of De La Soul fame.

i fully expect the patriots D to play well.  i will be disappointed if they don&#039;t.

REPLY - MPC - So the tornado in Worcester in the 50&#039;s and &#039;78 blizzard was also global warming?]]></description>
