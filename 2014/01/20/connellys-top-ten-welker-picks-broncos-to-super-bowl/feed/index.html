		<description><![CDATA[for someone so cynical, you sure seem much angrier than myself, that fully expected the patriots to play well (they didn&#039;t) and hopefully pull out a road win in the AFC championship game (so many plays left on the field).

so now we are going to hear all this stuff about brady&#039;s legacy taking a hit.  what a joke.  whether you win all the super bowls at the end (elway) or beginning (brady), it doesn&#039;t matter.  the patriots have won 3 with brady at the helm.  he&#039;s a winner, and the greatest of all time in my opinion.  he&#039;s getting up there, but i think if you switched the QBs in this game, you would have seen an even more ridiculous score.

if the pats can win 1 before he&#039;s done, doesn&#039;t all that nonsense stop immediately?  it&#039;s just crazy.  people don&#039;t understand how lucky we are.  to this day, no one understands how miserable it is to live in cities like st. louis, cleveland, houston... heck, even cincinatti - which makes the playoffs 3 straight years and can&#039;t win even 1 game because of absolutely deplorable, miserable play by its QB.  wake up people.  you are LUCKY.

that being said... he sucked and didn&#039;t get any energy until the 4th quarter and by then, too late.  what worries me is that there has to be some amount of tension with the coach/gm that keeps giving him mediocre talent in critical spots.

welker went after talib with clear intent to hit him.  i don&#039;t know if injury was intent, but if you just watch the replay from the broncos side of field, it&#039;s beyond argument he was steamrolling right for him.  it should have been, at worst, a flag.  given that the nfl is so allegedly concerned with player safety, he should be fined.  no on suspension.

26 points to that offense, despite all the yardage, is definitely not that bad.  the pats could have easily won that game had the playcalling been better (fire mcdaniels...) and brady played even a B-type game.

you are way too down on chandler jones (he was drafted as a project, you know that right?).  give him 2 more years, minimum.  i do think you&#039;re about right with ninko - in the sense, that he shouldn&#039;t be a top-3 defensive cog... maybe top-7.  still a good player.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t understand these pick plays. Sometimes they throw a flag sometimes they don&#039;t. That said, I don&#039;t think Welker&#039;s intent was to injure, just impede. But should&#039;ve been flagged. 
The call on Hooman was ridiculous. 
NFL Referees were horrendous this year. Made the Replacement Refs look tolerable. 
Watched game with a guy who said he thought Brady was missing those deep routes due to thin air in Denver. 
Am I the only one that wishes Josh McDaniels takes the Cleveland job? 
Every player Josh brought to the Pats were a huge disappointment. Fells, Tebow, Amendola, Loyd, Hoomanawanui, Salas
Can&#039;t whine too much. It&#039;s been a great run!

REPLY - MPC - McDaniel D / Brady has played in Denver five times he should know better / NFL should release their evaluations of officials to appease fans that they are working on a broken machine]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting write up. I think you were too hard on a lot of the like, ninkovich and jones... As much as I hate to say it, Brady lost this game he left 14 points on the board with overthrows. Bills stupid 4th down play calling didn&#039;t help either, and of course talib&#039;s injury had a huge impact. With talib out our offense needed to step up, they didn&#039;t...

Confused about this line though
&quot;* Prater insane weapon (don’t even have him kick off just put the ball on the 20)&quot; Do you really not think Gotkowski could kick it out of the endzone every time in denver if that was the play?

REPLY - MPC - Yes Gostkowski could hammer it / but it takes a whole play away from the game in Denver and many other places just serving as a border for commercials / In the playoffs Ninkovich and Chandler Jones COMBINED for 6 tackles in two games and no sacks - thanks for the reply]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Belichick was absolutely bullsh*t about the Welker hit.  He called it one of the dirtiest plays he has ever seen.

It absolutley kills me to say this but .. Brady&#039;s legacy took a hit in this game and has gone on the decline for several seasons.  Manning undressed him yesterday.

It&#039;s frustrating that the Pats came out with that game plan/product yesterday.  In hindsight, allowing 26 points against that offense on the road isn&#039;t THAT bad.  Granted, they gave up a ton of yardage - but a lot of that changed with the Talib injury.  I completely blame our offense for that loss.  Play calling was horrible.  Ugh.

REPLY - MPC - Brady losing his game? Lack of talent on that side of the ball and horrendous play calling all combined for a loss]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Could not agree more about that Welker play. That was clearly pass interference, and went uncalled immediately after refs called a much milder version on Pats. I saw it live from my chair, never mind replay. Where was the whistle? But Broncos probably still deserved the win.

REPLY - MPC - After the Talib injury they deserved because they were far superior but if that doesn&#039;t happen its 3-0 and they are 3rd and long - bummer]]></description>
