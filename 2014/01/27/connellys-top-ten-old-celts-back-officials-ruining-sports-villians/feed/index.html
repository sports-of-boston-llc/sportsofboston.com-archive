		<description><![CDATA[Economist Tobias Moskowitz examined the home field advantage in some detail in his book &quot;Scorecasting&quot;.  He concluded that the home field advantage in team sports is almost entirely explained by officiating.  Refs tend to rule in favor of the home team.

REPLY - MPC - Its really crazy - I read most of scorecasting - great chapter about extra time in soccer favoring home team]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i said the same thing about terry.  i wanted to boo.  of course he hit a dagger 3 last night when Cs were trying to make a game of it.  stiff.

you would say that about pierce... he looked really sad last night.  like a sad snapping turtle.  probably wondering why he has to exist in mediocrity anywhere but here.

REPLY - MPC - Great trade for Celtics]]></description>
