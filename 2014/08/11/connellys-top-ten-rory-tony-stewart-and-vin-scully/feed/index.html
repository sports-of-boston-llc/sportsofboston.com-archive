		<description><![CDATA[the kevin love stat is a little skewed due to NBA lockout in 11-12 season.  also, loves major injuries have been hand-related... not like ACL, back or ankles.  freak accidents.  lastly, love was on pace to play all 82 games in the 10-11 season but had a groin pull with 9 games to go.  MIN was terrible (17 wins all season), no point in rushing their new franchise player back so they held him out.

in case you can&#039;t tell, i completely disagree on your point about the trade.  MIN did not get a steal.  instead, the league saw another star player hold a franchise hostage, force their hand and go exactly where he wanted to go.  anthony bennett SUCKS.  wiggins may be great, but who knows.  and the other 1st they are getting will be the 28th or 29th pick.  it may as well be lit on fire now.

REPLY - MPC - We will see on Love - he is a really good player but lets see him in a complementary role]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Looks like Boggs faced a player named Bob Gibson, who pitched four seasons for the Brewers and one for the Mets during the 80s: http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/gibsobo02.shtml

So no, not THAT Bob Gibson. He retired after 1975.

REPLY - MPC - That&#039;s good help thanks]]></description>
