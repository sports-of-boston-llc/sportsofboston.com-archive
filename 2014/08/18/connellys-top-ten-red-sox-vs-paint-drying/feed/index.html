		<description><![CDATA[The father stealing was central to the plot.  She told him everything, and he lied to her for years...she then realized that the father was full of s&#038;%t when he was hating on Lloyd.

I liked the 2003 Sox team for pure power.  They may have all been on roids, but that 77 team was drowing in cocaine.

REPLY - MPC - Was Coke that big back then though maybe five years later? I still think you could have had a protective father who is against this low life dating his daughter and that dynamic]]></description>
