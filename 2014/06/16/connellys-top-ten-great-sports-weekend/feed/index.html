		<description><![CDATA[i think MPC&#039;s point on NHL vs NBA is that ratings are climbing for NHL and NBA numbers are down for the sport.  This year&#039;s NBA finals ratings are some of their poorest in history.  The NHL just did the best numbers ratings-wise since the the last time the Rangers were in the Cup finals.  Yes, the NHL is going to get less viewers than the NBA, but it&#039;s all about growth in each sport... people&#039;s interest in hockey seems to be growing nationally.

Beyond that... Friday night&#039;s game in LA was the most exciting game in any sport I&#039;ve watched in the last 5 years, without a vested interest in either team.  It was that good.  Rick Nash&#039;s shot and subsequent deflection by Voynov was an absolute all-time missed chance, non-goal.  Then, the Kings fans can tell their team is getting a bit tired and so they start to chant, &quot;We want the Cup!&quot; and literally as the chant is happening, the Kings score.  Ridiculous.

I&#039;m no Lebron defender, but he&#039;s only lost 3 times in the Finals.  He&#039;s lost plenty of other times, of course, in earlier rounds.  He is a quitter.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I watched last night&#039;s game, it was legit ball.  Fun to watch the smothering D of the Spurs, and of course I enjoyed the shaudenfrade of watching Lebron go down again.  (that is 4 finals losses for him.)]]></description>
