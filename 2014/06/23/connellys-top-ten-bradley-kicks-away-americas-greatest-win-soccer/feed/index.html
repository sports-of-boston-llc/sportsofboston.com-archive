		<description><![CDATA[Gotta have Jim Rice in the top four exciting rookies.  How about Pedroia (ROY)?  Who was Gary Hancock?

REPLY - MPC - To me Rice wasn&#039;t exciting to 1977 - he was really good though - wasn&#039;t Hancock the guy who went 8-8 to start?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I never watch soccer, but have watched the World Cup.  The acting is ridiculous - I&#039;m disgusted by it.

If a guy gets taken off on a stretcher holding his head in his hands and crying, then re-enters the game within 2 minutes...something stinks.  These guys have absolutely no pride.  Is it any wonder that soccer players are never thought of as tough guys?  If someone tried that in football, his teammates would light him up.

Paul Pierce left in a wheelchair then returned and I will never think of him the same since.  It is every 2 minutes with these guys.  I can&#039;t stand it.

REPLY - MPC - Pierce would have been great in soccer with his bandage on his head. I think he was voted the number one flopper in the NBA and on the witness stand]]></description>
