		<description><![CDATA[The Bagwell trade was because we had the up &#038; coming Scott Cooper at third.  UGH!!  

Also worst trade politically, i agree, mainly because a precendant has been set on what a military life is worth to the terrorists.  I would not want to be a politician overseas, they just got put on the block as potentially taken]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Alan
Are you suggesting these guys aren&#039;t as bad as advertised?  Why would they be tried in US courts?  Are you suggesting they should get attorneys from the ACLU and a dream team of anti death penalty crusaders?
They&#039;ve been treated with kid gloves down in Gitmo where even the toilets were repositioned so they would never face Mecca. There are 100 medical staffers on site for 150 detainees. Compare that to the way our own vets are being treated by the VA. 
These guys were there for a reason. This president is either enormously incompetent or worse, did this because of ideology. He said he wanted Gitmo closed so he&#039;ll let the detainees that his own administration categorized as the 5 worst actors there go and call it an exchange. Other than Susan Rice, who the hell could defend this?]]></description>
