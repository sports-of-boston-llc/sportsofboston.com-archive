		<description><![CDATA[Agree with David H and Michael on this one.  Alan, go drink some more socialistic Kool-aid.  I am sure you voted for the what will be known as the single worst president ever, but you can pat yourself on your back because you feel you are politically correct

REPLY - MPC- no doubt]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alan, I&#039;m one of 11 kids and I have 6 family members who served in Iraq since this thing started and every one of them agrees with what Michael wrote.  

Germany was left alone after WW1 and we have them to thank for WW2.  We established a beach head in that part of the world and we could use a presence there going forward.  It seems to be working out in Korea  

Whether you like hearing it or not, there are rotten people over there and they are hell bent on punishing those that don&#039;t agree with them.

Fight them there or fight them here - either way, we are going to end up fighting them.

There is a reason why there are embassies around the world.  We could just leave the staff to fend for themselves like we did in Benghazi or we could have left a stabilization force there to ensure that American interests are protected.

I can certainly appreciate your concern for the safety of our troops - believe me I am too.  I do think, however, that if you let the bad actors in that part of the world have free reign then it will end up causing problems for everyone in the US.

Groups like this one causing havoc in Iraq will eventually pull off another embassy bombing like in Kenya or Tanzania &#039;98 or the World Trade Center in &#039;93.  We didn&#039;t have any forces there when those were planned - they just did it because they&#039;re scumbags.  Whether it&#039;s Iraq or Afghanistan or Syria or wherever...THEY are the problem

		<description><![CDATA[Oh yeah, glad we stayed in Berlin and Tokyo while they were in the middle of a civil war (not).  But talk is cheap.  Why don&#039;t you pledge an extra 200% in taxes to the Federal Gov&#039;t to support that effort, then get off your couch and go get yourself shot in Iraq so our young men and women don&#039;t have to?

REPLY - MPC - If you don&#039;t see a direct correlation between a radical Islamic group gaining strength and the risk to our country you are naïve - if Obama wanted them out and didn&#039;t care about the country he should have pulled the first day in office and saved all those lives over the last six years - you&#039;ll be the first one complaining when 9/11, Boston Marathon bombing, Time Square happen again.

Believe me I&#039;m paying enough taxes - sadly its paying for the pole vaulters at the Mexican border]]></description>
