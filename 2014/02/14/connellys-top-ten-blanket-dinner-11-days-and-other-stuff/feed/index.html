		<description><![CDATA[The day Nomar died is spot on.  Jeter into the stands and Nomar refuses to come out of the dug out to pinch hit.  That was the day SOX Nation turned on Nomar and RESPECT for Jeter went through the roof.

REPLY - MPC - You couldn&#039;t help but appreciate Jeter - he wasn&#039;t just an aristocrat in NY but a guy who can roll up his sleeves too - what we love here]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you, Giambi was safe, As were robbed. 
But Jeter, while a great player and a first-ballot HOFer for sure, should have moved off short when A-Rod came aboard, but refused. One wonders how great a team player he was in his later years. Even now he still wants to be the SS and has no range, check the Grantland article on him. And no, I&#039;m not jealous (except for maybe a couple of his girlfriends).

REPLY - MPC - Shortstop is like quarterback or bringing up the ball in basketball there is prestige there that takes precedence over team]]></description>
