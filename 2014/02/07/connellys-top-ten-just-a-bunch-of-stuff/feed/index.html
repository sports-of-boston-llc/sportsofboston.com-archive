		<description><![CDATA[Dark days of sports, maybe every three years, but not now, the Olympics are starting.  So do you think Pujols was juicing, what about Ichiro?  I would bet Albert juiced, but he got his pay day

REPLY - MPC - I don&#039;t think there is any question on it - a lot of rumors his trainer and Jack Clark - the more time passes the more Canseco was right 80%]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oscars??

Do you really think that it means anything at this point.  Not one nod for any movie that doesn&#039;t toe the Hollywood liberal line for years.

Agree on Ruth&#039;s Chris.  Bone in Cowboy Rib Eye the best.

REPLY - MPC - That&#039;s why Zero Dark Thirty was ignored]]></description>
