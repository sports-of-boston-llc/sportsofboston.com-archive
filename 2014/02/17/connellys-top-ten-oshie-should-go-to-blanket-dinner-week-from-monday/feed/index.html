		<description><![CDATA[Looking at the list of Red Sox second basemen made me think. People never stop talking about how small Dustin Pedroia is, but he really isn&#039;t any smaller than Jerry Remy, Denny Doyle, Marty Barrett or Jody Reed.  Or Joe Morgan or Ray Durham - its a small man&#039;s position.

REPLY - MPC - As a second baseman myself - I would like to call it the skilled position]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Re: &quot;* I like Ryan Miller over Quick in the finals versus Canada – better chance to steal one&quot;

Sadly, the US now can&#039;t meet Canada in the Gold Medal Game due to the bracket system used for the Olympics (no re-seeding)with the US as the #2 seed &#038; Canada as #3 (http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/olympic-hockey-tournament-bracket-set--usa--canada-on-collision-course-194030312.html). This means the US &#038; Canada will meet in the Semi-Finals if each wins their Quarter Finals game.  It&#039;s too bad that Finland didn&#039;t pull the upset over Canada in OT (Price made a big save in OT).  If that happened, Finland would have been the 3-seed &#038; Canada the 4th.  This would have meant that Canada would have had to play Russia (assuming a Russia win over Norway)in the Quarter Finals, &#038; one of the hockey powers would have been eliminated without a shot at a medal.  Plus, the US would then have Finland in their bracket for the Semi-Final rather than Canada.  Assuming a US win there, the US would only have had to play either Russia, or Canada, or Sweden in the Gold Medal Game but only one of the expected powers in an elimination game.  Now they&#039;ll have to beat Canada in the Semi-Final,&#038; either Russia or Sweden (possibly Finland) in the Gold Medal Game.  Of course, all is mute if US doesn&#039;t beat Czech-Slovakia winner.

REPLY - MPC - too bad now that its all over it was a great tournament]]></description>
