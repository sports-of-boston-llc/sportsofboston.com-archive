		<description><![CDATA[Fair point Lenny, I have no problem seeing Manziel&#039;s name being added to the pantheon of Browns&#039; QB busts. However, QB always has the potential to score the most fantasy points, and I think Manziel is the only viable (I use that term loosely) fantasy rookie for this season.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, thanks for the reply... I guess Im of the mindset that Manziel will flame out.  I don&#039;t know if he has the focus to make it as an NFL QB.  Hope Im wrong because I like the kid. I just have serious doubts.  

Keep up the writing!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lenny,

I believe it is still too soon to accurately assess who will start for the Browns week 1.

In short, yes, I would probably slide Manziel down a little, I can&#039;t envision a scenario where I draft him this season. That being said, if my starting QB looks mediocre and Johnny Football gets the nod and has a great first game--I would take the risk and hope he gains points with his legs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, nice take on the rookies.  Just wondering if you&#039;d drop Menziel lower at this point?! :)

Solid write-up on Ebron.  That&#039;s my both this year!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Steve, 

Great question. Andre Williams is more of a handcuff to journeyman Rashad Jennings. Considering Williams&#039; pedigree as a big bruising back, he should see some goal line work, but probably not consistently enough to sustain fantasy value. He is worth a speculative pickup in deeper leagues, and will be a instant fantasy impact if Jennings misses any time.]]></description>

Good stuff. Do you think Boston College&#039;s standout RB Andre Williams has a shot at putting up some fantasy relevant numbers with the Giants this year?]]></description>
