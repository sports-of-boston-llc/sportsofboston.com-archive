		<description><![CDATA[I think that these choices are not the direction that I would take, but make sense. All three are strong candidates for the title for their own respective reasons. I would also throw in Antonio Cesaro to the mix for the World Heavyweight title and give the WWE title to Barrett. I feel like Bray Wyatt needs to prove himself a little bit more since returning as his new persona. Also, Roman Reigns is another good choice for the WH title, but if he wins then this might drive a wedge between members of the Shield. 

Get better Daniel, and come back soon. Where&#039;s CM Punk?]]></description>
