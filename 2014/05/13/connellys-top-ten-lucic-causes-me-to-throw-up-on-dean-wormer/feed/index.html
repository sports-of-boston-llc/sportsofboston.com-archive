		<description><![CDATA[I have to say I&#039;m with Tim on this one. Lucic is one of the most consistently dominant players on this team. He&#039;s not to blame for the fact that his line has been playing horrible, that starts with the center Krejci. Sure he missed a couple of open nets in game 6 but I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if the real Lucic shows up for game 7.

REPLY - MPC - Would you like to rethink?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good article but not sure I understand the desire to trade Lucic. He&#039;s the most feared guy in the league and the size/skill combination is a very rare thing. He scores goals, fights, and imposes his will on his opponents in the corner. Yeah he can be frustrating at times when he doesn&#039;t bury the goals, but this is not a guy we want on any team but the Bruins.

REPLY - MPC - I can tell you he was tough during the handshake last night]]></description>
