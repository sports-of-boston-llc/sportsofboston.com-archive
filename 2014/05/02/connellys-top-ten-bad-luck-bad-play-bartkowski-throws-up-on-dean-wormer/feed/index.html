		<description><![CDATA[Baseball comments are spot on, boring, slow, cold game that is over-commercialed with advertising.  Even pre-game at the park, they bring out the (insert brand) official ball holder, along with official blood donor of the game.  

Comment on Dean Wormer spot on, as Animal House was on cable last night as well.  Flipping channels with my ten year old boy made me realize he isn&#039;t ready for that movie, but some day we will watch it together]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lucic seems lazy to me. I&#039;d rather see Sean Thornton out there than him at this point - there would be a lot more effort.
I&#039;m really starting to like Dougie Hamilton. The kid stands out in my opinion. 
I agree with your assessment of Tory Krug the other day - he is such a good skater.

I agree that Subban seems to get away with a lot, but he is a difference maker.

I think Tronburger is right - they keep outshooting them like that they&#039;ll win this thing. There were so many close calls last night. Bergeron and Iginla just missed the net, Lucic fans a few times, Marchand and Krecji have been snake bitten - posts/crossbars - some of these will have to go in at some point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[in terms of chara, see your 2nd note for your &quot;Habs&quot; section.  i thought chara was quiet offensively, but he was clearly using all energy to negate that top line of montreal.  i thought he played well to be honest.  very effective.

bartkowski sucks.  BUT... is meszaros, who is slower and more lumbering than david ortiz, a better option?  that&#039;s the worst part about him being so terrible.

bruins PP was also terrible last night.  couldn&#039;t get set up.  canadiens was almost automatic, pretty much difference in game.

krejci loves the backhand on the breakaway (he won an OT game last year against TOR w/ a backhand), but yeah he&#039;s just gotta rip that top shelf, glove-side.... 2x!!!

lucic fanned on a great feed from krejci... wake up, milan.  what a whiff that was.

they keep playing this way (attempted 96 shots with 51 getting registered as shots), they&#039;ll win the series.  particularly if they can tighten up and restrict montreal&#039;s opportunities even more.

and finally... it is despicable that ESPN buries the coverage of that game as like the 9th headline today.  that was an instant sports classic.]]></description>
