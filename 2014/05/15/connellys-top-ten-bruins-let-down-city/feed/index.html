		<description><![CDATA[Untalented bunch of dirty hacks.  If the Bruins were playing the Space Jam Monsters, I would be rooting for the monsters.

REPLY - MPC - I disagree with you - they are likable and in general work hard and easy to root for but they weren&#039;t the same hungry team this year]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Could not agree more with your Lucic/Marchand analysis. Both calls on Marchand were bogus, but were made because he&#039;s a reputed punk. I find it impossible to like Marchand and he&#039;s on the only team in the NHL that I like.

I&#039;m tired of the &quot;Lucic is a tough guy&quot; thing as well.

I liken it to some DB in football who makes a tackle after getting dragged for 5 yards and giving up a first down, then getting up and dancing and posing.

What Thornton did was stupid, but at least when he&#039;s on the ice he&#039;s always trying.

Totally bummed that the season is over. I admit that I&#039;m one of the people who only gets real invested during the playoffs, but it is a blast watching the Bs go all the way to the finals.

REPLY - MPC - Me also I don&#039;t watch to the playoffs but I love it and do - now weeks of watching three hours Red Sox games - ugh - Lucic was tough in the hand shake line though]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry but Miller is not bad compared to Chara not clearing pucks out of his own end. I cringe every time Chara touches the puck in his own end and he has pressure on him.
I have been making this statement for a while. This series I focused on Chara and he was absolutely putrid. He gives up more pucks than anyone.

REPLY - MPC - Chara not the same player but for five games he did shut down Pacioretty]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i agree on the huge letdown and lack of fight.  but rask and lucic aren&#039;t going anywhere.  brad marchand... maybe.  who would take him, though?

the Bs will live to fight another day, and maybe next time with more oomph.

what really depresses me is that it is still over 2 months until training camp even begins for the pats.  i can&#039;t watch baseball, anymore.  what to do???

REPLY - MPC - Check out the backup&#039;s numbers its the system not Rask - I move him because of perceived talent - baseball is boring!]]></description>
