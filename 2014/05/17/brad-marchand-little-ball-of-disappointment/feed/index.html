		<description><![CDATA[Great points there Brad. Bergeron could develop chemistry with a traffic cone.

My biggest concerns are A) The speed again. I know Marchy&#039;s speed wasn&#039;t much of a factor in the Montreal series, but when we look back and say okay we have to get faster, is trading away our fastest &quot;offensive-minded&quot; forward the answer?

And B) The PK. Statistically speaking, the Bruins weren&#039;t as strong on the PK as other years either in the regular season or the playoffs. With Soderberg playing so well. Chris Kelly is going to be gone. If you let Marchand go too, you&#039;re getting rid of 2 of your top PK guys.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While Marchand and Paille are probably the two fastest guys on the team, they did not deter the Canadiens all that much. (a lofty 1st line is probably the main reason but that&#039;s a different argument).

Sure, PK goals is a nice stat during the regular season, but these goals did not help them get past the 2nd round. Also, this chemistry Marchand and Bergeron have is just Bergeron&#039;s greatness spilling over to Marchand&#039;s stat sheet. For example, during the disappointing 2005-2006 season, Bergeron&#039;s line-mate Glen Murray had 24 goals and 53 points. Then, Bergeron went down with concussion issues and Murray only lasted in the league for another two years before his exit. Granted, Murray might have been old but he never saw his offensive production again since Bergeron&#039;s injury.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fair point on Marchand, and his dissapointing play this offseason is an issue that needs to be addressed. 

However, you missed a major reason he&#039;s on this team: He kills penalties. Yes I know, the Bruins have plenty of PK guys (Bergy, Campbell, Paille, Eriksson, Kelly, etc). BUT Marchand was among league leaders in PK goals and he has tremendous chemistry with Bergeron.

Besides, after the Bruins have gotten eliminated by a faster team, do you really want to get rid of one of our quickest players?]]></description>
