		<description><![CDATA[krejci would a plus-7 if his linemates could finish some of the chances he&#039;s created in 5-on-5 action this series.  i think he def didn&#039;t play well against DET (he was out there against datsyuk) but he&#039;s been good in this series.

i am also in disagreement about soderberg.  was dynamite against DET and then had primary assist on pretty feed to paille on saturday.  they shortened 3rd line time due to team being down in 3rd period.

also... who would you trade for on minnesota?  do they have stars?!?  mauer?  he sucks and is always hurt.  lester is a horse.

REPLY - MPC - Twins have two top ten prospects - one is hurt which is the best time to get them Belichick would say]]></description>
