		<description><![CDATA[-I didn&#039;t read your Old School II close enough and thought you were talking about the 2014 Ole Miss team until the 3rd asterisk.

-Brady and Pats shut me up too.

REPLY - MPC - I guess I should have worded the Ole Miss a little better]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If the refs weren&#039;t horrible last night, could have been 53-17.  12 penalties to 4?  That&#039;s gotta stop.

REPLY - MPC - I thought Bill needed to get in someone&#039;s face and pick up a 15 yarder - insane and at home]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tim Tebow can&#039;t play in this league. 
Look, if he could, someone would have signed him in a heartbeat. Check out some of the QBs who are out there. It&#039;s not like he has baggage, the dude can&#039;t throw and can&#039;t progress pass his first read.

REPLY - MPC - Here are his NFL stats - 17 TD to 9 INT (1.88 better than 13 QB right now) / he ran for TWELVE td and in turn opens up running game for running backs / his won loss record was 8-6 a WINNING record - I know he&#039;s not your kind of guy but tell me that isn&#039;t in the middle of the pack?]]></description>
