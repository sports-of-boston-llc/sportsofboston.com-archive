		<description><![CDATA[Yes, Round 9, haven&#039;t watched that in awhile. Gave me chills.  Two lions!

REPLY - MPC - I know within the context of today that that type of brutality is frowned upon but that was the essence of the sport - two human beings giving everything - is there anything better even if life is reduced after that - how many people can ever say over an eighty year period that they were in a situation that they gave everything]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Victor Kiam&#039;s first game as owner,  was when Flutie and the Patriots gave Ditka a heart attack, literally. Early bomb to Fryar and the rout was on. 

Last time the Bears beat the Pats was back back in December 2000, and JR Redmond led NE in rushing with 18 yards. Belichick&#039;s first year as head coach with the Patriots. 

If Marcus Smart starts for the C&#039;s to open up the year, it&#039;s been a while the last time a rookie opened up the season in the starting lineup. 

Zolak had a chance to cash in with a playoff start at Jacksonville, but came up small that day.

REPLY - MPC - Bad effort in Jacksonville no doubt - no six shooters for Z that day / good note on Flutie and Kiam / Marcus Smart good enough to start even with Rondo injury is not good news]]></description>
