The Chiefs were able to do anything they wanted against the Patriots throughout the game on both sides of the ball and they made the Patriots look like a cellar dweller instead of a perennial contender. Despite having two wins thus far, the Patriots have not looked good on both sides of the ball for an entire game to open the season. There are many causes for this, some with short term fixes and others with more long term questions. The three issues of focus that have come to mind are personnel, coaching, and fundamental play on the field.</p>
<h2>Personnel</h2>
<p>The hallmark of the Patriots the past 14 years has been the ability to draft well, spend frugally, and cut bait with veteran players just as they were about to decline. Despite this reputation, the Patriots front office has been inconsistent for nearly eight years now, far removed from the 2000-2005 days when seemingly ever personnel move worked.<span id="more-81406"></span></p>
<p>The foundation of every team is the draft and since 2006 the Patriots have not been great in the category. From the 2006-2209 drafts, the Patriots have only three players remaining on their roster: Jerod Mayo, Sebastian Vollmer, and Patrick Chung. Despite all three starting, none of them have played well consistently this year which is especially concerning with Mayo and Vollmer who are former All-Pros. The Patriots appeared to turn things around in the 2010 draft by drafting starters Devin McCourty, Rob Gronkowski, Brandon Spikes, and Aaron Hernandez in the first four rounds. This draft paid immediate dividends as Spikes and McCourty started on defense and Gronkowski and Hernandez became the most feared pass catching duo in the NFL. The long term implications are cloudy however as Spikes and Hernandez are no longer with the team and Gronkowski has had health issues the past two plus seasons. McCourty is an excellent free safety but the view of this draft hinges on if both he and Gronkowski can stay healthy and play well for years to come. This draft represented the Patriots taking several risks both health and character wise, some have paid off in a big way and some have backfired in a big way.</p>
<p>In 2011, the Patriots used their first pick on a potential left tackle of the future, Nate Solder. Solder played sparingly his first year behind Matt Light but started in years two, three and four. The results have been mixed to say the least. He played well enough in 2012-2013 but has been a disaster in 2014, getting beat so badly through the first four games that he was benched against Kansas City in favor of Marcus Cannon, another 2011 draft pick who has been inconsistent but mostly poor as a pro. Also in 2011, the Patriots used the 33<sup>rd</sup> pick on corner Ras-I Dowling, a player with good physical skills but who barely played while with the Patriots because of fragile health and was eventually cut. The Patriots did pick up Stevan Ridley and Shane Vereen in this draft as well as a solid back-up quarterback in Ryan Mallet. They were also able to turn another first round pick into a second round pick and 2012 first thanks to a trade with New Orleans.</p>
<p>The 2012 draft was a case of the Patriots making big slashes early and taking a risk at the end while missing in the middle rounds. They had two picks in the first round and traded up with both of them to select Chandler Jones and Dont’a Hightower. Jones has been a dominant pass rusher but has been decent against the run. Hightower’s first two years were inconsistent and he looked slow at times but has been one of the Patriots best defenders in 2014. Alfonzo Dennard, who was selected in the seventh round because of character concerns, has started consistently at corner for the Patriots when healthy and has proven to be a solid number two corner.</p>
<p>The next offseason, New England did not have a first round pick but had two second round picks which they used on Jamie Collins and Aaron Dobson. Collins has turned into a starter and has played well in pass coverage but been suspect against the run. Dobson has shown flashes of talent at receiver, but has played only one game in 2014 and has one catch, clearly nowhere near expectation. They also selected Logan Ryan and Duron Harmon, who have played inconsistently. Ryan has looked good in coverage but has made several costly penalties including a hands to face penalty against the Chiefs which led to points and his benching. Harmon came into training camp as the favorite to be the starting strong safety but has barely been on the field. The Patriots also traded four picks from this draft for veterans Aqib Talib, Chad Ochocinco, Albert Haynesworth, and LeGarrette Blount. Talib and Blount worked out but Haynesworth and Ochocinco were failures.</p>
<p>The Patriots most recent draft saw them make picks more geared at the future than the present. Dominque Easley, a player coming off two torn ACLs, could develop into an elite pass rusher and defensive tackle but has played sparingly so far. Jimmy Garoppolo could be the quarterback of the future, but the jury remains out on him. James White and Cameron Flemming saw playing time against the Chiefs but also have not done enough to be judged. It is important to note that from 2006-2014, the Patriots used two picks in the first two rounds on an offensive lineman and two picks in early rounds on defesnive linemen which are the two areas they have struggled most in 2013 and especially in 2014.</p>
<p>Free agency and trades have been hit or miss for the Patriots since 2006, especially at the top of the roster. Reche Caldwell led the team in receptions in 2006 but only lasted one season and had a key drop in that season’s AFC Championship game against the Colts. Jabar Gaffney proved to be a nice addition via trade, but he was mostly effective as a third or fourth receiver. Randy Moss and Wes Welker and Donte Stallworth contributed in big ways to one the best offenses ever on 2007 and signing Junior Seau worked out well for the Patriots defense. The highest price addition of that offseason was Adalius Thomas who played well in 2007 and early 2008 before breaking his arm. He was never the same after that injury and became a locker room cancer which led to his release after the 2009 season. Overall, this offseason can be chalked up as a win for the front office. Assante Samuel left in 2008 and the Patriots failed to find a suitable replacement but they did give Randy Moss a nice extension, making this offseason relatively neutral.</p>
<p>Following the 2008 season, the Patriots signed several veterans in what appeared to be a stop gap type of season. None of the veterans worked out as Leigh Bodden, Shawn Springs, and Joey Galloway were all gone within a season and a half. The most notable move of the 2010 offseason was the large extension handed out to Vince Wilfork as well as an extension for kicker Stephen Gostkowski. Derrick Burgess was signed as a potential pass rusher but he did not pan out.  The 2010 and 2011 offseasons were quiet outside of the draft, with the most notable moves being during the 2010 season in which they signed running back Danny Woodhead and reacquired Deion Branch from the Seahawks. Branch was not the same athlete as he was in his first stint with the Patriots, but he was a solid contributor for 2010 and 2011 and was a leader in the locker room. Woodhead played well throughout his tenure with the Patriots, blossoming intone of the NFL’s best third down backs. 2011 did see them make two high profile trades for Haynesworth and Ochocinco, neither of which benefitted the team. The draft was the biggest part of their 2012 offseason, with the addition of Brandon Lloyd at wide receiver bringing both locker room headaches and on the field performance. Aqib Talib was a great mid-season addition and he was able play well for a season and a half before departing for Denver.</p>
<p>The 2013 offseason was tumultuous for the Patriots to say the least. They lost Woodhead and Welker to free agency and Hernandez because of a murder charge.  Lloyd was also released and spent a year out of football before signing with the San Francisco 49ers in 2014. Julian Edelman did emerge as a pass catching threat but the signing of Danny Amendola has not worked out as he was on and off the field in 2013 and has three catches in 2014. They also signed Will Svitek, Tommy Kelly, and Armond Armstead to try to bolster the offensive and defensive lines but none of those players are still with the team. Adrian Wilson and Leon Washington also did not pan out for the team and are now no longer in Foxboro.</p>
<p>This past offseason was also eventful. Edelman was resigned to a three year deal as was Brandon LaFell to try to improve the receiving corps. The most notable additions were Brandon Browner and Darrelle Revis who were brought in to make the secondary elite. Thus far LaFell has had one good game (against the Chiefs) and Revis has been used curiously by the coaching staff leading to several completions against him. Browner just finished a four game suspension so the jury is still out on him. Trading Logan Mankins two weeks before the season for Tim Wright is also not working out. It is no secret that Mankins play was down in 2013 but he was a leader among the linemen and a less than his prime Mankins would be better than what we have seen out of the line so far. It does not help matters that Tim Wright has been a ghost so far which cannot be totally attributed to him as he has had to learn a complex offense on the fly.</p>
<p>When great quarterbacks begin to decline later in their careers, teams usually try to put the best talent around so that even though their play may dip, the players around them will compensate. One only has to look at John Elway with the Broncos, Brett Favre with the Vikings, or Peyton Manning with the Broncos for examples of this. Tom Brady has dipped in play the last year plus and the Patriots have not done much to help him. They have made additions on defense but have surrounded Brady on offense with talent that in some cases would not see the field on lesser teams. While John Elway got Terrell Davis and Favre got all his weapons back, Brady has seen many of his depart. And while Manning has seen his team go after players in free agency that can both protect and produce for him, Brady has been asked to do more with less. Although that is not new for Brady the difference now is it is not as easy for Brady to make up for everyone else.</p>
<h2>Coaching</h2>
<p>The next part of the Patriots that needs to be looked at is the coaching staff. Bill Belichick is one the best coaches ever, but one has to wonder if something is off as his trademark defenses have not been a top ten unit since 2008 and have been gashed in their two losses this season. Darrelle Revis, one of the elite cover corners in the game, has played mostly zone and has only spent one game shadowing an opponent which was week two against the Vikings when he shut down Greg Jennings. One has to wonder why Revis has been stuck in zone most of 2014 and if Browner’s return will change that at all. Matt Patricia has also been at the helm throughout most of the Patriots defensive downturn. Although the Patriots will always be “Belichick’s defense” it is fair to wonder if Patricia is not the right fit as he has been in charge of defenses that have consistently ranked at the bottom of the league. The Patriots invested heavily in defense heading into 2014 and have now given up at least 190 rushing yards in both of their losses.</p>
<p>Also, Dante Scarnecchia has cemented his spot as a hall of fame assistant coach through September as his replacement, Dave DeGuglielmo has been unable to get the offensive line on the same page and the Patriots have been throwing different units out there nearly every half this off season. There have been rumblings that some offensive linemen do not like working with DeGuglielmo, which Greg Bedard discussed on Felger and Mazz last week. Josh McDaniels has been limited with his play calling options due to talent on the field, but he has made some curios decisions. For example, the play calling at the end of the first half against Oakland limited the Patriots opportunities for a touchdown. They ran the ball and chewed up clock and timeouts on the first two goal to go plays and then on the third there was a bad snap which led to a quick throw away by Brady.  Had the Patriots chose to throw on second down and take a shot in the end zone they would have had more options on third down had they not scored. Also, the opening series against Kansas City was baffling. The Patriots only dressed three true wide receivers while dressing extra offensive linemen. Instead of running the ball early as personnel would dictate, the Patriots threw it three straight times and punted after a quick three and out. The second down call for a deep pass to Julian Edelman made little sense as it is a deep pass to a receiver that is not a deep route runner and who was covered well.</p>
<p>It is also questionable why the Patriots have not tried to involve Aaron Dobson more, activating him for just one of four games. Dobson showed flashes of potential last season and has the speed to be an outside receiver but his opportunities thus far have been limited. Many analysts have pointed to the Patriots playbook being an issue for players which can also lead to asking the question: why not dumb it down a little? The playbook could still be complex but if things were simplified a bit, such as a limit on the amount of option routes they run, they might be able to use some top talent at wide receiver that does not have as high a football IQ.</p>
<p>Belichick teams have been at their best with strong assistant coaches who were willing to challenge both Belichick and the players. If you looks at the staff of their three championship teams you will see names such as Eric Mangini, Rob Ryan, Romeo Crennel, Scarnecchia, Pepper Johnson, and others. One has to wonder the assistant coaches are not of the same breed they once were.</p>
<h2>Performance on the Field</h2>
<p>Any football team comes down to one thing above all: the players on the field. To this point, the players on the field for the Patriots have been abysmal in certain areas and passable in others, with few being elite or even above average.  The offensive line is the most glaring hold but the offense overall has performed poorly. As I wrote last week in my piece regarding Bryan Stork, Tom Brady has been under quick pressure all season and that only got worse Monday night. Marcus Cannon, who had been previously been benched and did not start, ended up playing two different positions bring his season total up to three in four games. Nate Solder and Sebastian Vollmer were both benched at different points and leave little room for confidence moving forward.</p>
<p>The wide receivers have had trouble getting separation and Brady has essentially thrown to Edelman, Gronkowski, and no one else. The fact that Aaron Dobson and Kenbrell Thompkins have not been in the lineup together at all with Dobson playing only one game is not good for an offense that has struggled to move the ball and throw downfield. Edelman is simply not built to run down the field for deep passes and asking him to do so just isn’t fair. Danny Amendola has been a non-factor and has looked easily covered so far. Brandon Lafell has been a late bloomer having his best game against the Chiefs but the Patriots had to have been expecting more to this point. Tim Wright’s play, as highlighted above, has also been detrimental.</p>
<p>The most important position on any team is quarterback and the Patriots have received subpar play from that position this season. In 2013, Brady could be given the benefit of the doubt due to the high amount of roster upheaval before the season and Gronkowski being only available for six games during the season. This season however, there is not as much room to hide. Yes, the offensive line has been a disaster and yes the receivers have not been getting open as much as they should but Brady has been bad, plain and simple. While facing no pressure against Kansas City Brady only had a 61.8 passer rating and a -4.2 Pro Football Focus grade, two numbers that were unthinkable a few years ago. He threw two bad interceptions and almost had a third had Sean Smith been able to secure an errant pass. He has had made bad decisions consistently and seen ghosts even when not under pressure.</p>
<p>Defensively, the Patriots have been far below expectations. This unit was supposed to be the strength of the team and have not lived up to the hype. They have been dominated up front in their two losses and gave up 300 yards in the first half to the Chiefs which is the most ever in a half under Belichick. Revis has played well overall but has some near misses in coverage such as a Mike Wallace touchdown in week one and a slant reception to Dwayne Bow last night. Both times he was close to breaking up the pass but both times close was not enough as the throws were completed. The linebackers looked good the first three weeks but were dominated in week four. Backs and tight ends were running free across the defense all night.  Vince Wilfork has been pushed around and Chandler Jones has been largely absent in the Patriots two losses. Jamie Collins has proven to be a subpar run defender and the strong safety position is still an unknown almost a month in.</p>
<p>To put it simply, when your two best players after four games are your punter and your gunner, you have some work to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Short Term Solutions</h2>
<p>Luckily for the team and their fans, there are several things they can do this season to improve and make themselves a threat in the AFC. The first would be to settle on an offensive line unit and have those five play it out After four games, the coaching staff has to have an idea of who their best five are and having them stick together through good and bad will help build continuity which is important for a unit that always has to be on the same page.  They also need to work on offensive line fundamentals which have been an issue thus far. This is a coaching issue and one would expect this to improve.  The next fix offensively would be to run with Stevan Ridley more. Ridley is a violent runner who brings more power to the table than any other back for New England. His fumbling issues have been well documented but at this point the Patriots should look to get as much talent as possible on the field and Ridley is their most talented overall back. Aaron Dobson should also play more until he proves he cannot. Having a legitimate deep threat could help the offense stretch the field at least make defenses respect the back end of the field. The more reps Dobson can get the better for the receiving unit as a whole and would allow Edelman and Amendola to run routes more suited for them. The final offensive question rests with Brady. While it is absurd to think Brady will be benched this season, he has to play better. Part of his issues are due to protection and weapons but there is no hiding his inaccuracies and bad decisions. If there is a quarterback that could turn it around one would think it would be Brady.</p>
<p>Defensively it will help to get Browner back this week. The team should also start playing Revis the way he is meant to be played by sticking him on the opponents number one or two receiver and having him take that player out of the game.  This will take pressure of the rest of the defense and allow McCourty to track the ball and make more plays. They also need to figure out the strong safety and defensive tackle positions. Chung is a decent run defender but is a liability in pass coverage and New England has been pushed around up front. Losing Sealver Siligia did not help matters as he was their best run defender up front. They need to find a rotation at defensive tackle that will help stuff the run with Chris Jones and Joe Vellano needing to step up. Casey Walker, who was claimed from the Panthers last week, should also be given an opportunity as he is a large body up front that could help in the run game. Despite the linebackers playing poorly in week four, they are still a solid unit overall so one would not expect much tinkering expect to change a few coverages to prevent some of the lapses that happened Monday.</p>
<h2>Long Term Fixes</h2>
<p>In the long term, the Patriots will need to asses both their coaching staff and front office. The recent Patriots have been reluctant to draft interior offensive and defensive linemen high outside of 2014 and they will need to make investments in those areas. They should also consider simplifying their offense a bit in order for a relatively young unit with an aging quarterback to gain rhythm. They also need to look at the coaching staff. Perhaps they need more voices to challenge Belichick and some current coaches might not be gelling with the staff and players. Also, the Patriots have been unable to draft and develop wide receivers and cornerbacks for years and those two areas on the coaching staff may need to be addressed. Time will tell on that end as a full season will be a great evaluator of how this staff works with its players. Also, if they start playing Revis as a shutdown corner and he plays well, an extension for him should be a priority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What to Expect</h2>
<p>Although this article points out the reasons the Patriots have not been playing well, all is not lost. They can still become a serious contender and have bounced back from bad losses before, but the multitude of issues they face is troubling. The Patriots have shown over the past 14 years that they have an incredible ability to bounce back from poor performances and improve every week, which will be tested again this year. Many of the short term issues can be fixed and one would expect a Bill Belichick coached team to fix them. They need to have them fixed sooner rather than later as their schedule will only get tougher as the season progresses. The sky is not falling, but it is not close to being blue either.</p>
