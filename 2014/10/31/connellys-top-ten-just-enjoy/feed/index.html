		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll never forget the Hagler/Hearns fight.  My brother, Father and I went absolutely crazy watching it.

REPLY - MPC - The fight in Wembley Stadium (Minton?) / Mugabi / all amazing but that first five seconds of Hagler - Hearns was primal at its core]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tough question about reliving sports periods.  I can&#039;t make that decision...so lucky to have experienced each one in all their glory!  Great to just reminisce about each one, thanks!

REPLY - MPC - we have been spoiled!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, those medical professionals cannot spread Ebola if they are asymptomatic, and they have every reason in the world to track their symptoms. Best way to stop Ebola is to have them go over there and prevent the situation from worsening. Will they go if they are mistreated on their return?

REPLY - MPC - Can you be sure that people exposed to the epidemic can not spread the disease because the bowling ebola doctor didn&#039;t think he had any problems until he started coughing up a lung in the middle of a 3-9 split / Believe me they are better people than me for the work they do - I would put them up in an isolate wing of the Ritz and feed them lobster tails all day because they deserve it but if you go there you have to stay 21 days in isolation its part of the sacrifice]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tom Jackson is worse. Belichick told him to F off after NE beat Carolina in the Super Bowl. Jackson tried to congrat him after the big win. 

Elway never lost to the Patriots as a player. 

Those Thomas&#039; (no relation) manning throws to are scary. 

Remember when Denver played at NE last year Del Rio last year he was the head coach. Fox had heart issues. 

Moreno, now with the Dolphins had over 200 yards rushing against NE a season ago. 

Enjoy when these two legends meet. Something tells me they&#039;ll meet again in January. 

Larry Bird mid 80&#039;s wish I could go back. It didn&#039;t matter who they were playing you watched it. Could have been home vs crappy Cavs.

REPLY - MPC - Wasn&#039;t it the Cavs that Bird dove into the press table against - amazing! Good point of Del Rio / Elway was bad times in Foxboro / I want Browner to take a 15 yarder on D Thomas early]]></description>
