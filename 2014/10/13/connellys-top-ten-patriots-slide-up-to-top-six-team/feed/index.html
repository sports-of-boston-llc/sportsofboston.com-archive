		<description><![CDATA[Agree wholeheartedly about the pink thing being overdone. I have a very big loss in my life due to breast cancer, but seeing little 10 year old boys at pop Warner games decked out in pink and wearing those elastic bracelets with &quot;Save the ta tas&quot;  and &quot;I love boobies&quot; on them is ridiculous. At this point we are all aware. 

REPLY - MPC - The beauty of marketing making everyone feel that if they don&#039;t do something or buy something they are on the outside or even pro-cancer

Plus the Komen foundation giving a slew of money to Planned Parenthood - an organization that doesn&#039;t even have the equipment to cancer screenings - is crazy. It&#039;s just the new trendy thing at this point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pink ribbons are overdone. Plus Komen foundation head makes $684,000. Meanwhile No. 1 killer of women is heart disease. Not that research on breast cancer is not necessary and worthwhile, but you are right on, Michael.

REPLY - MPC - Nice paycheck for selling a lot of pink stuff]]></description>
