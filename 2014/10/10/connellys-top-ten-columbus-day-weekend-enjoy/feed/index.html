		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure about that, Michael. It&#039;s not like he&#039;s beating people up or breaking laws left or right. If he could play, he&#039;d probably be signed. Patriots sure didn&#039;t care about the distraction factor. Some lesser organizations might be scared, though, hard to tell, you might well be right in some cases. Just don&#039;t think I&#039;m rooting against him in my opinion.

REPLY - MPC - that&#039;s what makes sports great - we have differing opinions watching the same thing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Michael, re: your reply to Tebow last week, whether he is &quot;my kind of guy&quot; is irrelevant. Plenty of worse guys playing football in the NFL, that&#039;s for sure! My kind of guys play well! If you want to throw stats out, how about career 47.9 completion percentage, 46.5 the year he started for Denver and 123.5 yards per game, 6.7 per completion? But stats aren&#039;t the point. If the NFL guys thought he was better than stiffs currently taking snaps, they would sign Tebow in a heartbeat. He&#039;s not, and they aren&#039;t. 
Fully agree, BTW, it&#039;s time for some of the Bruins to start producing.

REPLY - MPC - Would you agree half of the reason he&#039;s not in the NFL is because of the whole scene and distraction he brings with him]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; Has the attack already started

Back to craziness, huh?  It was nice not to read that s**t since it was on hiatus after the global warming comments you made about the MLB All Star game.  It was so nice in fact that I&#039;m not willing to put up with it again.  Today is the last I will ever read this blog.  Enjoy the rest of your paranoid filled life--I want nothing to do with it.

REPLY - MPC - The great thing about this country is the fact that you are not compelled to do anything you don&#039;t want to - no one forced you to read my Top Ten (you&#039;ve said before you have read every post so I guess you really like my writing). Feel free to move on. You can fill your day with Al Jazeera TV (funny you supported the business transaction between your hero Al Gore and Al Jazeera last year and now those two are suing each other - Al should be careful with who gets in bed with - it hurt him with Tipper and now in his business transactions - remember when you supported them - that was awesome). Remember you said vacating Iraq wasn&#039;t a problem - that was awesome (I know the fact that George Bush was right about vacating Iraq is painful for you) / Remember when you supported  open borders - that was awesome (disease and bombs to follow) / Remember you defended the five released Al Qaeda commanders who included Mohammed Fazi who Human Rights Watch said should be tried on Human Rights Crimes and Mass Killings (you should have him by for tea) - that was awesome. Remember you supported the Attorney General calling off interrogators of the Marathon bombers - that was awesome. 

This is what makes this country great - its that we have opposing views on all things it appears but still we love the country (I hope I&#039;m not putting words in your mouth)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hurst would get the ball before Kershaw. 

Agree about Texas A&#038;M beating Ole Miss. 

Dak Prescott is my Heisman choice. 

Bills have a solid front seven, but Orton is at quarterback. NE should win a close one. 

Jim Rice hit everyone in 1978 but had trouble hitting Guidry.

I&#039;ll take Miss. State, Baylor and UCLA.

REPLY - MPC - Yes on Hurst / I like Prescott and his father in the stands / I will agree with all three of your college picks]]></description>
