		<description><![CDATA[for me, lucic has actually had his most consistent season.  even in the month of march, he tallied 3 goals and 8 assists while also leading the team in hits for month.  he registered 2+ hits in every game except 2 in the month.  he&#039;s also top-6 in NHL in hits on season.

don&#039;t forget - while lucic had those numbers, his linemate iginla lit it up for pretty much the entire month.

i see far less loafing on a daily basis from him, and i credit that directly to iginla.

how does the situation with NESN and Sox resolve re: Remy?  they can&#039;t fire him... wish they could.  that article in the Globe was sickening.]]></description>
