		<description><![CDATA[I have been a parent for about 35 years. We
adopted our kids and had trials and tribulations
as do most parents. I myself was a huge enabler
however for the most part the enabling has
generally worked very well on the plus and minus
basis. It&#039;s so easy to convict someone of being
an enabler. Some parents may choose not to
enable but dis own their kids and live their
Lives to the fullest. Jerry Remy could not pre suppose
the horrific event of his son. He could have just 
Turned his back many times.
I am sure he put a lot of his life on the line for
His son. Jerry Remy just from listening to him
All these years is a very honest man and
a sincere person. More parents should be like
Him. Most parents have never or will face his
situation. Remy at the same time is honest.
What Remy is going through could be any if us.]]></description>
