		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with you on the broken sticks - don&#039;t understand why they seem so determined to stay out there. It&#039;s like being a man down.

Krug is quite small, but he is one of the team&#039;s best skaters and passers.  Shouldn&#039;t he be wing or a center?

REPLY - MPC - They better do something up front because it is Sahara desert right now - Bergeron looked like a fool on Saturday for two minutes]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[MPC, if Saturday was your 2nd visitation to the Bs season, then it makes sense why your comments appear to have come from the triangle of Fenway Park...

I don&#039;t disagree on your Chiarelli point on its face, he&#039;s had a rough go of it, he seems too secure in his job, and I think he needs to go at the end of this season pending its outcome.

However - presently, this season... and in terms of formulating an opinion based on that one game Saturday night... did you see NESN show the lineup of Bruins watching from the rafters in the 2nd period?  from left to right it went Krejci, McQuaid (he&#039;s always hurt, and limited offensively but he&#039;s a body for the PK and always wins his fights if that matters to you), Chara, Marchand (was hot last couple weeks), and Kelly (no great shakes for sure but he has to be better than Lindblad).

That&#039;s literally millions in salary not on the ice.  You can&#039;t make a snap call on their game against the Habs.

What they do need is a sense of GM urgency to improve the roster by the time these bodies get healthy.

REPLY - MPC - Second full game that I have watched they don&#039;t captivate me - there is no rhyme or reason to their game - sure Chara makes them better in the back but other than an oft injured Krejci who on that injured list makes you better - please don&#039;t say Marchand! look at the numbers - he&#039;s better standing on a bar with his shirt off]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are totally WRONG about the Bruins.. they are going through an historic injury bout right now... BASEBALL IS BORING.. BASEBALL IS BORING not hockey..

REPLY - MPC - Tell me who on the injured list improves you up front dramatically - Marchand don&#039;t even say it - look what he&#039;s done over the last 100 games - Krejci sure he&#039;s a creator but you better start getting concerned about his ability to be healthy this year - then what - too much money for lucic, rask, marchand, Kelly, paille, Campbell, etc]]></description>
