		<description><![CDATA[Nick I agree the first lineup looks better. And I am not anti-Sandoval if the Sox also add an elite pitcher. As a team the Red Sox were tied for 23rd in the majors in ERA (4.01). And the Sox allowed the 7th most runs scored against them (715). I just think pitcher is a much greater need.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But how much more power would he have playing his home games in Fenway instead of in San Fran (and most of the rest of the NL West, for that matter)? This sets it up perfectly for Sandoval to replace Ortiz at DH when the time comes. And I can&#039;t see why the Sox front office wouldn&#039;t be able to do both Sandoval and a front-line starter. I love that first lineup so much more (with Ortiz in the 3 hole, though); I&#039;d pay 5 years, $90 million for that lineup.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t agree more, Tim. I feel like I am the only one in Red Sox Nation that believes Brock Holt is a fine third basemen and leadoff hitter. Or, slide Holt to short, and bring Bogearts to 3rd, whatever. Pitching is so much more important than a middle of the order bat, with limited power.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with you Jon. It seems pretty apparent to me that Sandoval is a terrible contract waiting to happen. With his size, he won&#039;t be able to play the field (especially 3rd) more than 2 more years. Even if he does stay healthy, unlike Prince Fielder, he will likely be relegated to the DH spot and he just doesn&#039;t have enough pop on his bat for a $100 million dollar contract for someone who won&#039;t play defense.]]></description>
