		<description><![CDATA[revis changed game on consecutive plays.  smashed up run play for loss of 4 yards putting colts in 2nd and 14.  then deflected pass into air allowing mccourty to pick ball for INT.  amazing.

gronk is seriously pissed off.  i wonder if he&#039;s angry at his body for failing him?  doubters for saying he couldn&#039;t do it anymore (i mean, he&#039;s still just a 25 year old kid)???

REPLY - MPC - Sergio was the guy that broke his arm on the extra point]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gronk is a beast both on that block of his out of bounds and his TD catch and run!!!!!!!!
Homeland was excellent last night. Like you watched it and still caught up with the game.
Yes, the old Heffenreffer days. Just as cheap and crappy beer but good puzzle caps was red,white and blue beer]]></description>
