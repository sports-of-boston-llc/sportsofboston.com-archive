		<description><![CDATA[Agree on 8 team playoff as well, long over due.  Unfortunately, I think political correctness will run amuck and they will pick four teams from four conferences, to be &quot;FAIR&quot;

Under-rated movie &quot;Big Wednesday&quot; great coming of age film with decent actors and director

Chips first, then the rest

REPLY - MPC - I will put Big Wed on watch list - tx]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been arguing in print for a decade for an 8-game football playoff. Far better to have the No. 9 team angry than have a committee choose between several one-loss teams for the No. 5 slot. 
8-game playoff requires seven games, four quarters, two semis and a final. All that was necessary to go with 8 was to take the same six bowls that are rotating in the current format - Cotton, Sugar, Orange, Rose, Fiesta and Peach - and instead rotate the first six games among them, and then add the title game. 
No idea why the powers that be couldn&#039;t see the wisdom in that, they are going to make more money this year and would have made even more money with that 8-team format.

REPLY - MPC - My hope is that they will see the great success this playoff has held on the sport this year and know that you need to increase. Any of those eight teams could win it which would make it amazing]]></description>
