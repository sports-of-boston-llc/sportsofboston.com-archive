		<description><![CDATA[Agree on high school football on TV, Gresh did do a very good job.  Seems like a lot of local names as well, Tippett, Wilfork, Sorrento, etc... and yes Everett is a MACHINE of a program.  I wonder what their record is over past 20 years, seems like they win #1 half the time

REPLY - MPC - Xaverian seems to be a destination now for players -]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[nate solder blows.  he sucks and he blows and he&#039;s awful.  he is a detriment to everything they are trying to do out there at times.

i said the same thing when the game started about the fireworks.  at least the pats just use muskets.  far less smoke.

not sure about your stevens comment.  there is limited talent on the roster.  i think he can coach.  they gave him a long contract for a reason.  they want him here through all the losing as danny hopefully brings in more able bodies.  whenever that happens, well... who knows.  god it&#039;s gonna be a long dark winter in celtics land.  thankfully we get football for most of january...

REPLY - MPC - Problem with Stevens is that I don&#039;t see players improving which was supposed to be his calling card and his stoic persona comes out on the court - there is no fight or compete in them]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Was at a conference last week talking to a guy from NC.  He said that Luke Kuechly could run for governor there and win in a landslide.  

Good to see a solid guy doing well.  Has not received the recognition that he deserves.  A lot of loudmouths have gotten more attention, but I&#039;d build a defense around him any day.

REPLY - MPC - Class act no doubt who looks like he&#039;s on the way to the Pro Football Hall of Fame and really if BC didn&#039;t anything for him they owe him to start a College Football Hall of Fame campaign for him]]></description>
