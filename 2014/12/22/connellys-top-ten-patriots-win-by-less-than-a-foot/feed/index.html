		<description><![CDATA[Praise of Ryan was tiresome. Did the announcers not think the Jets&#039; athletes might have been playing for their own pride and competitive spirit (and their jobs), not just their coach and his job?

REPLY - MPC - Guy ended up with a losing record - does he go to Oakland?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Watched the &quot;SEC Storied&quot; on Chucky Mullins the other night.  He&#039;s the Ole Miss football player who died after complications from a paralyzing hit during a game with Vanderbilt in 1989.

Great program - you should check it out.

REPLY - MPC - Put on the dvr thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Still don&#039;t get why a pass rush is so hard for the Pats and so easy for other teams (like the Jets) playing against them.

REPLY - MPC - I get that its keep everything in front but any QB with time will complete passes]]></description>
