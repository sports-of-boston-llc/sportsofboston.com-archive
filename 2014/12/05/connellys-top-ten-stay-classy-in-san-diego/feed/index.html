		<description><![CDATA[On point #9
Ain&#039;t that Obama&#039;s home town?
Maybe his pastor can have chickens come home to roost.

Ain&#039;t that where former Obama White House flunky, Rahm Emanuel is Mayor, where he has &quot;never seen a crisis you cant take advantage of.&quot;

Maybe Rev. Jackson and Rev. Al can spend time in the Chicago streets instead Ferguson 

Statistics have this awful way of telling the Truth]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No 3rd superstar in 2013, are you kidding me?  Jon Lester was a horse in world series, 2 wins, 0.59 ERA, 0.65 WHIP, 15 K&#039;s 1 walk.  Post season 2013, 5 games, 6 runs, 4 wins 1 loss and the one loss he only let up one run.  That&#039;s why Lucky Lucci-nose should be embarassed for the 4 yr 75 mil offer he made Lester.  He was a HORSE in post season.  Defenders, add in Deacon Jones.  never saw him play, but highlights show him as top ten]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Reggie White number ten? Should be higher! Ask Max Lane. 

Clowney meet Aundray Bruce, Falcons No. 1 pick back in 1988. 

Oregon wins by double digits. Very difficult to beat a team twice in the same season. 

Pinkel and Saban were teammates at Kent State, played under the late Don James.

REPLY - MPC - Don James has a good coaching tree / Reggie White was great - not great at picking his topics to speak about]]></description>

REPLY - MPC - They really only have fragile Chandler Jones forcing them to do some stunts for Ninkovich or Ayers]]></description>
