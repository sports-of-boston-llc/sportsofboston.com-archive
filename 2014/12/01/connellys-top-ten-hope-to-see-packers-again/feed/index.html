		<description><![CDATA[That game when Wensink skated to the Northstars bench and called them out was quite a thing. But, I believe the fight prior was Wensink skating up behind the opponent and sucker punched him starting that fight
Next time the Bruins faced them Wensink got his butt kicked. I dont recall if it was the guy he fought before but he got beat pretty good]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If my memory serves me right Wensink sucker punched the guy from behind.  Taking on the bench was classic.  But, Wensink got his butt beat down the next time they faced each other]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[TD by Nelson wasn&#039;t Revis&#039; fault. He had outside position, protecting the out route. Safety (McCourty) overplayed the outside instead of protecting the middle. Watch the replay of that play one more time and focus on McCourty.

REPLY - MPC - In that case - his game was an A+]]></description>
