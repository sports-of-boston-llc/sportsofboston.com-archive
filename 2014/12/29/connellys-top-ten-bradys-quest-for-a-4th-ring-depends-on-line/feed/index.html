		<description><![CDATA[Perfect comment on Addazio and sideline-guy.  Aren&#039;t schools supposed to have anti bullying policies?  Addazio whined after the game that he needed his own recruits but let&#039;s see how he does next year without the 5th year offensive linemen and no graduate transfer quarterback.

REPLY - MPC - I love how rumors start about these coaches that they are sought after for other jobs and thus they get jumps in pay and years - at this point he is no O&#039;Brien who was average himself]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[so... who exactly should call the redskins for RGIII?  not the patriots, right?  he BLOWS.  sucks eggs.

REPLY - MPC - No an NFL team that needs a QB - he&#039;s a value in the 3rd round worth the risk]]></description>
