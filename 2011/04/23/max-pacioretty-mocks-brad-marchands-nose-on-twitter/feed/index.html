		<description><![CDATA[Fair enough 55.. I was upset in the heat of what had happened.

To be honest, I think Pacioretty&#039;s comment was pretty dumb, but also harmless.

On a more positive note, I think we can all agree that the Habs/Bruins series was clean, fast-paced, and very exciting (game 7 overtime, anyone?)

Certainly not the dirty affair I was bracing myself for. I think at some point they were the least penalized series of all playoffs going on.

As much as I tend to hate the Bruins, now that the Habs are out, I wish the Bruins well and I&#039;m glad they swept the Flyers :-)

Cheers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No penalty..?  He got a game misconduct for it.. So incorrect Steve - also you going on about them being whiners, and then going on for a good few line by whining yourself is a bit hypocritical.

I personally thought it was only a bit of fun from Pacioretty - I mean after everything that&#039;s gone down between the Habs and Bruins, a bit of banter is fair game surely?

And as for Bob... -facepalm-]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bunch of f*** whiners, Bruins fans, only 8 out of 32 series vs Habs. Your Humpty Dumpty coach cried like a baby &quot;wha wha we didn&#039;t get a 5-on-3.&quot; Well maybe if you stopped the dirty hits, and shooting the puck in the stands which is an automatic, you wouldn&#039;t be down 5-on-3. Also too many men on the ice-- usually the coach&#039;s fault. You only have yourself to blame.

You guys are a joke. Chara: &quot;I didn&#039;t know it was him.&quot; Ferrence: &quot;my glove got stuck.&quot; You guys have raisins for brains!

When a Canadiens player puts a Bruins player in the hospital with NO PENALTY, NO SUSPENSION, NO CONSEQUENCE WHATSOEVER, maybe we can talk.

Until then, stop being such crybabies!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for proving my point, Bob. At least no one I&#039;ve ever known has booed the Canadian national anthem like Montreal fans have been known to boo ours from time to time. Nor did any of us throw hissy fits and start talking about peoples&#039; noses after Marc Savard was blindsided.]]></description>
