		<description><![CDATA[Brian brings up a good point. Other teams have been vocal as it pertains to the trade. The Lakers openly questioned the move. 

Furthermore, I remember listening to JJ Redick last year during the Finals talk about Perkins being one of the best screen/pick setters in the game. I think that was part of the intangible I was thinking about when I made my initial point -- the intrinsic part of the game that doesn&#039;t necessarily show up on the stat sheet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know, my sentiments go both ways. Hence why, I pointed out the merit behind Perk&#039;s intangbiles as well as his value being romaticized and thus inflated.

No objective person, whether it be a fan or whatever, can say the Perk trade was a win for the Celtics right now. There&#039;s no way, from Rondo walking around catatonically for a month to the overall aura the team gave off heading into the postseason. Watch the 4th episode of the Association, even Doc looks morbid. It&#039;s clear this trade was a poloarizing move.

Could that change? Of course. Was the trade defensible? Ditto. The Celts needed a perimeter defender to help Pierce guard the LeBron and Melo&#039;s of the world for the playoff stretch. 

I agree, though, the C&#039;s wouldn&#039;t have been able to sign Perk and Ainge trying to get something for him now makes sense. Not to mention, he only played 14 games up to the point of the trade, and the Celtics had the best record in the league to that point. And finally, like Andrew said he got more money in his deal from the Thunder than the Celts could have offered him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[well Andrew...When other teams say they feel better against the Celtics now that Perk&#039;s gone that&#039;s not a matter of just Celtics fans having an attachment. 

The Celtics do NOT have a center on the roster that can cover the pick and roll and rotations as well as Perkins did which is a huge part of their defensive scheme. It&#039;s all help defense and rotations. 

The Knicks had nothing past Melo and Stoudemire (and it&#039;s spelled Stoudemire not StoudAmire) and Amar&#039;e was clearly not himself. 

Jeff Green&#039;s contract is up too and he may be harder to resign than Perk was because he may want to go back somewhere that he can start. 

Also the biggest part of the Celtics dominance has been the emergence or Rajon Rondo. As Rondo goes so goes the Celtics. Look at a team like the Heat that doesn&#039;t have a point guard to distribute the ball and bring order to the offense. It&#039;s clear that in the half court they struggle.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Perk and Big Baby&#039;s contracts both expire at the end of this season. Ainge did the right thing in getting something (Jeff Green) for Perk. Now they can afford to keep Big Baby and they added a young talent for when the big 3 leave. 

Perk has next to no offensive game. He&#039;s solid on the defensive end but he wasn&#039;t worth the money he would have been asking for this offseason. 

Lets be realistic... perk isn&#039;t the reason the Celtics have been a dominant team over the past few seasons-- its Allen, Pierce, and Garnett.

Perk&#039;s &quot;value,&quot; ie his intangible qualities and the &quot;fear&quot; he supposedly put in other teams was largely based on the biased overly-emotional attachment the boston fans had for him.

Bottom Line: its time to move on. 

there&#039;s nothing wrong with sweeping a team that has melo and stoudamire...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Perk&#039;s value was more intangible based rather then any quantitative measure any stats could back up, which sounds like a cop-out (and probably is to an extent). He added to their defensive cohesion and team chemistry. Truth is the team bought into the (flawed) statistic of the C&#039;s not losing a series with the &#039;08 starting line-up. (The reason it&#039;s flawed is because injuries happen. It&#039;s part of the game, but that&#039;s a different debate for a different day.)

The detail that Boston fans still refer to this as the Perk trade (and not the Jeff Green trade) is a red flag. We&#039;re longing for our anchor, rather then embracing the new. Though, the new piece isn&#039;t exactly giving Celtics&#039; fans a reason to embrace...

With all that being said, Perkins will never be mistaken for Tim Duncan, or even Marcus Camby although it could be easily argued his skill has been dramatically romanticized since the move. The big winner in this has been Perk and clearly his value has been diluted.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Perkins never was an offensive threat but the way he played caused other teams to fear the Celtics. He brought an attitude that contributed a great deal to the team&#039;s overall defensive intensity. A lot of times KG and Perkins fed of each other and it was clear that opposing guards and swingmen would not be allowed to enter the paint without paying a price. 

If you want to look at numbers then take a look at Krstic in the playoffs against the Knicks who have no real interior threat at center. He didn&#039;t score a bucket until the last game of the series and Doc didn&#039;t even have enough confidence in him to play him more that 5 minutes in the first 2 games. He can score the ball yes, but the Celtics won their title based on their defense. Their defense took a step back with the loss of Perkins. 

THAT is why the deal has not proven to be a good one yet. Even if a championship is won, it doesn&#039;t make it a good trade. In their first series if it wasn&#039;t for Glen Davis in game 4 and the starting 5 you wouldn&#039;t have survived. 

Don&#039;t look at them sweeping that series as them blowing by the Knicks. They didn&#039;t. They should have beat that team but a greater margin in every game, especially with two of their stars either not playing or not 100%. 

Jeff Green, Krstic, Pavlovic, Murphy, and Arroyo have contributed very little, or not even played so far and that is clear evidence that they just aren&#039;t cutting it. 

Perkins may have had injury trouble, but with the exception of maybe Ray Allen and Paul Pierce, who hasn&#039;t been injured over the last few years. 

Fact of the matter is the deal wasn&#039;t a good one. If the Celtics win or lose.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Perkins was way too much of an injury risk. Plus, Krstic is taller and a better overall shooter. And remember when he came over and got six offensive boards in one game? That potential will be a huge wild card in the playoffs. Boston is a team built around guards and forwards, which is why they&#039;re able to weather this storm of injuries around their centers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Have you noticed the wonderful stats that Perkins is putting together for the Thunder?  Why, in the last game alone, he had 2 points, 2 rebounds and 2 blocks.  Wow!  Actually, I believe he&#039;s averaging about 4 points per game so far, and I&#039;m not aware that he&#039;s led the team in rebounds in any game he&#039;s played.  Gee, how in the world could the Celts have traded such a spectacular performer?  I watched him for awhile on TV, as he amassed foul after foul, setting his traditional rally breaking moving picks.  Yep, it appears that the Perk tradition is alive and well in Oklahoma....and thank goodness I don&#039;t have to watch him any more.

Now that Donny Marshall - riding the anti-trade bandwagon - has stated on TV that Perk was the &quot;heart and soul&quot; of the Celtics, I&#039;m sure that Pierce or Garnett can ease away into the sunset, knowing that they can never hope to be even 1/2 as important to the team as Perk was. Rondo too.  He&#039;ll never be considered as great as Perkins, or in any way as important to their success. Hopefully, Marhall is receiving professional help for his brain tumor.]]></description>
