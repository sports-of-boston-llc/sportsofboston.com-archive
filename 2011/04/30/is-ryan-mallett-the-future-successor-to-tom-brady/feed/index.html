		<description><![CDATA[Over a year now since Ryan Mallet was drafted by the Patriots and if what this &quot;writer&quot; wrote seems so offbase. As we know now Mallet can move pretty well in the pocket. Also he has NOT been arrested or accused of anything criminal or even immoral. If he had all these problems we should have seen something concrete by now. All I hear from the Coach are good things about Mallett. Maybe, just maybe, all that crap were lies. Just saying.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris, this is a he-he said deal. Obviously his agents said one thing, the right thing to say, but it&#039;s not crazy to think that the kid was out the night before.

I have a very solid source who goes to Arkansas and told me that he would see Mallett out all the time and that he was &quot;big into drugs.&quot;

Agents say one thing. You never know what to believe. But I&#039;ll take Sports Illustrated, Pro Football Talk and ESPN.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Get your facts straight, Mallet did NOT miss a meeting with Carolina because of a &quot;Night out&quot;. Check your sources, Bro. The story has been debunked by agents AND the Panthers. It&#039;s irresponsible reporting and it needs to stop! Want something to back it up? Here it is. Every reporter that has published repeats of this story should have to publish PUBLIC apologies to Ryan Mallet!

http://bleacherreport.com/articles/672299-nfl-draft-2011-ryan-mallet-story-false-enough-with-irresponsible-journalism

I&#039;m not saying he has the greatest &quot;presence&quot; nor that he comes across as the sharpest tool in the shed, but the constant harping on unsubstantiated stories gets tiresome. 

In short, writers need to check stories out before publishing potentially damaging stories. Untrue stories are told often enough, and they become accepted as truth. It&#039;s funny how a scandalous story makes the front page, but the retraction is considerably closer to the rear.

I think the Pats are a great place for him to learn and develop under some of the best minds in the NFL. Time will tell if he ever plays an appreciable amount in New England or if he ends up like Cassel and is dealt to another team where he is able to do well.]]></description>
