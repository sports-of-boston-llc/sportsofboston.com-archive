		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the kind words, Dave. And I concur - both the NBA and Kobe did a great job handling the issue and issues like this are going to cause sports to constantly evolve. I thought Stern and Co were quick to act which showed there was no chary-ness on the leagues part. Bryant also has stayed visible and accountable. In this article - linked below - Bryant mentions his natural inclination to be a role model which is what prompted me to draw the Barkley connection.

		<description><![CDATA[Good article. I thought the NBA and Kobe did a good job afterwards though.

You do have to agree that even the sports world and star are constantly evolving. 

If Jordan had said the same words 20+ years ago, there might have been some shock in the media. They would probably portray it as &quot;athletes being athletes, etc.&quot;]]></description>
