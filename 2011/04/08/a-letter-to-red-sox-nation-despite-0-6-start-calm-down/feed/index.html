		<description><![CDATA[Well your 2-8 now with the worst record in the majors and were just murdered by a team that was completely dismantled, their only hitter injured, and only scored 0 to 1 run a game.
They scored 16 off Boston. Sox made the Rays look like the 27 Yankees.
Look, there is something completely dysfunctional about the whole team and its fans. If you guys and the team didnt boast you&#039;d get sympathy..but your a hyped media creation..a pop star with autotune, a tv movie of the week and dont know you place.
Growing pains..they have the same pitching staff and its the worst ERA in the entire league]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lester&#039;s better from his first start, but Lackey is still a complete waste after a horrible performance against NY. Only half a rotation will keep the Red Sox from the playoffs again if they keep procrastinating on getting better (i.e, April baseball doesn&#039;t matter).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; April baseball doesn&#039;t matter.

Actually, a game in April counts exactly the same as a game in June, July, August or September.  Hey Red Sox, I don&#039;t know what the f*&#038;k you were doing for a month down in Florida, but I have news for you: the season has started.  Its time to start winning.]]></description>
