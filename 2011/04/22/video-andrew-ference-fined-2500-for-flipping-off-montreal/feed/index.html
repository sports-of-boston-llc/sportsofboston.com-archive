		<description><![CDATA[Hey I&#039;ll flip em 2500. if he&#039;d flip the announcers off next game

&quot;What he does next ENRAGES me!&quot;  Really, dude if ENRAGED is a reasonable reaction to a glove with a finger up, you need intense anger management sessions.  Jeez you act as if the announcer nearly wets himself for every almost MC goal while any comments on Bruins plays are delivered flaccid and stale at best.

Yeah go call 911 for four hours to report the flaccidity of peenie weenie MC-fetish guy]]></description>
