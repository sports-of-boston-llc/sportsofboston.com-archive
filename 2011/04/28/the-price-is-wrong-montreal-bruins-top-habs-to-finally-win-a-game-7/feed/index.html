		<description><![CDATA[Wow - no biases evident on this blog ....  Glad to see some mature, objective opinions are being expressed.  How about one from someone who doesn&#039;t like either team, but will certainly acknowledge it was a great series.  Hold on Boston fans, you won&#039;t like this ... It simply came down to whoever got the last lucky bounce - in this case it was Horton&#039;s shot off an ankle to win it.  Despite all the tough talk Boston fans, that&#039;s what it came down to.  And Montreal fans, stop whining - you have no right to complain. You&#039;ve had far more than your share of lucky bounces over the years.  Now let&#039;s all just move on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You must tell me the name of the acting school all the canadiens attend together up there. Retired habs players aswell as deceased ones would cringe at the way the current montreal team acts and dives to win games, integrity for the game and their franchise is something the coaching staff and some players know nothing about, I used to respect and cheer for the habs when the bruins would be knocked out of the playoffs but I CAN&#039;T say the same now, and I find it sad and MOST DEFINATLY PATHETIC. Enjoy the rest of the playoffs though! ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Funny how sometimes the losing team gets all the admiration and respect from the hockey community&quot;- GT

What respect are you talking about? The respect that the hockey community gives to floppers? The high stick didn&#039;t even touch him, but got the call anyway.
The guy who skated into Ferrance AFTER the whistle was blown, and flopped on the ice, you think you have respect?
After Subban held onto a stick, looked at the ref, and then Light-As-A-Feather-Stiff-As-A-Board flopped onto the ice to try and get a penalty.
Sure, he may be a good player, be him self is a joke. This was his second year and he was rated #15 among the world of sports most HATED players.

Also, if they skated and outplayed the Boston Goons, why did Montreal have to shave?

And I do give you this, Price is a great goalie, and is only going to get better. Thomas might not have that much time left, but this season isn&#039;t over for us. Why should we be talking about next year when we have more teams to play?
You guys can talk about your next years team all you want, but Bruins need to focus on now. (Just rubbing it in your face because it makes me laugh a bit)


And lastly, to be a bit more of a jerk...
&quot;May the best team win tomorrow!! ‚Äúwink‚Äù&quot;-GT

Yes sir, they sure did!

Love always,
Abubbica!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh boy was I waiting for you GT,  I was hoping you would come back to this wonderful site and not bathe in defeat like the rest of your fans.  Truth is, you have been great and your fans should try and be like you.

your right, our Goaltender is going to be 37.  Its a good thing we have a 24 (going to be 25) year old, starting playoff goaltender, right behind him.   I guess you must have forgotten about Tuukka Rask.  Im pretty sure he faired well in his rookie season last year and will for many years to come.

As for that high sticking penalty,  I give that dive a 9.8.  Sweden gives it a 9.9, England gives it a 9.9, and Canada gives it a 10.  Stick didnt hit him in the face at all.  Look it up.    

And lets go all the way back to my &quot;Why I hate Montreal&quot; article...

I said that when ever your team loses, you will always find an excuse and cry about it.  Well looky here.  A sad Habs fan telling me his team would have won if they had their &quot;5 key players back from injury&quot;.  

Thank you GT for proving my statement.

Finally, that little statement about your losing team gets all the admiration and respect from the hockey community.  Last time I checked your own country doesnt even respect your team. Maybe it was that time you wanted to be your own country.  How did that go? 

I hope to hear from you again GT.  Maybe next year you will have some insults that wont get spun completely around like Carey Price in net.

http://www.motifake.com/montreal-canadians-hockey-greg-montreal-canadians-suck-sport-demotivational-posters-4886.html  sums it up pretty nicely]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t count on it buddy! Nobody here in Montreal is losing sleep over this. We are extremely proud of our team. In the end, they deserved a better fate, they outplayed and outskated the Boston Goons. They never gave up...all this with 5 of their key players injured.

In the end, they played more for the logo in front of their shirts, than the name in back of them. Can&#039;t say the same thing about the Bruins. Your team is a bunch of individualists that your coach can&#039;t seem to control. Another hit into the Stanchion? A high stick late in the 3rd? WTF? 

See, in the end, the city where you play and your fans do make a ton of difference. Bostonians just love the violent stuff...so your team just loves to show that on the ice, it&#039;s good entertainment, like a Hollywood movie lacking any soul or script, but full of action.

Well, you&#039;re about to play another team that plays the same way. Who knows (or cares) what the result will be. 

But I can tell you this - They play real hockey in the Western Conference. Even if you beat the Flyers, any team in the West will destroy the Bruins in 5 games, just like the Habs would have done if they had Markov, Gorges and Pacioretty back.

So you better enjoy this ride now, because next year, your 36 y/o goalie will be 37, while ours is just starting to mature now at 23 y/o, and oh yeah, we&#039;ll have those injured guys back in the lineup too.

Funny how sometimes the losing team gets all the admiration and respect from the hockey community.

Cheers!
