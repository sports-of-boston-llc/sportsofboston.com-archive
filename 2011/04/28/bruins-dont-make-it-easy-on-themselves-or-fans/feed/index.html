		<description><![CDATA[I was especially not amused by Bergeron&#039;s high sticking penalty with less than three minutes left in the game.  Bergeron hit Wisniewski twice in the back with his stick while skating behind him.  That penalty gave the Canadiens a power play and allowed them to tie the game and send it into overtime.  Was Bergeron deliberately trying to throw the series, or does Montreal have some kind of secret weapon that allowed them to take over his brain?]]></description>
