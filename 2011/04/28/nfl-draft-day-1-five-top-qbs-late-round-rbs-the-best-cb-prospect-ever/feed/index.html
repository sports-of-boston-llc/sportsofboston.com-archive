		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m aware of the current case, I was asking specifically for a citation to how this violates antitrust law.

I&#039;m also aware the owners chose to opt out of the CBA and that it expired in March. This draft though was agreed upon when the last CBA was signed. I have seen nothing regarding the NFL losing its antitrust exemption.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The owners choose to opt out of the CBA, causing it to expire on March 11, the same day the players voted to disband the union and the owner&#039;s locked out the players.  As the US District Court has already determined, the NFL therefore no longer enjoys an exemption from the antitrust law.  See Memorandum and Order dated 4/25/2011, Brady, et. al., v. NFL, et. al., D. Minn, Civil No. 11-639.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This draft was approved by the NFLPA when the last CBA was signed. Holding the draft does not violate antitrust law.

If you&#039;re so sure it does, will you provide a legal citation?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This year&#039;s draft is potentially meaningless.  At this point, the rookie players are free to negotiate with any team they want.  If the owners act collectively (collude) to prevent a rookie from marketing his service to any team, then they will be liable for an antitrust violation.  Under antitrust law, the draft can only exist when it is agreed to by a union organized by a vote of a majority of the players.  Since there is no longer a player&#039;s union that can agree to the draft, it violates antitrust law.  I am much more interested in seeing which rookie is the first to challenge the draft.]]></description>
