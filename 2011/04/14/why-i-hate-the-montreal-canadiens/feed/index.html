		<description><![CDATA[You need to get a life. 
Honestly, is that your lone goal in life? Hate us? 
Keep on hating man, but keep in mind two wrongs don&#039;t make a right. 
Cheer for your team and we&#039;ll cheer for ours. Degrading another team on an article that&#039;ll be published for anyone to see, is whiny, classless and simply pathetic. Isn&#039;t that why you hated us?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would first like to say that I am a Canadian. Secondly, Chara&#039;s hit was legal but at the same time illigal. The reason is simple. 1) Chara&#039;s hit on Max happened so fast and you know how fast can an accident arrives... but on the other end, Chara exagerated his hit by pulling his arms foward making it illigal due to the fact that Max head was heading straight to the that window poll...you know! But... I have to agree with Bruins fans on this one... calling the cops... WHAT! they must have gone crazy or somethin&#039;... I mean come on I know you hate the team... but now its becoming very or should I say to personal... The problem with the fans in Montreal is that they are not fans of hockey but instead fans of the MTL Canadiens. True hockey fans wouldn&#039;t dare to do such a thing]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A search on this page with the word &quot;classy&quot; turns up 2 results. Both on your post. Not sure what you&#039;re talking about.

I suppose you&#039;re trying to throw bricks while in a glass house, because you can now add that Lucic hit on the list of the &quot;Class acts of the Bruins&quot;...totally uncalled for.

I liked that rubber chicken...it looked funny.

Look dood, you&#039;re allowed to hate the Habs, just like I hate the Flyers. Why? Because the Habs beat the Bruins most of the time, just like the Flyers beat the Habs most of the time.

May the best team win tomorrow!! &quot;wink&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Look guys, I&#039;m not sure what the debate is here. The Habs are the Habs. Like you guys mentioned, we are at the epicenter of Hockey. Montreal is a bigger city than Boston, yet we only have ONE pro sport in town. Hockey is who we basically are. We are serious fans...and our announcer and fans DO NOT yell &quot;Whooo&quot; when the Habs score. It&#039;s a serious game to us.

You Habs haters only wish they were as fortunate as montrealers, it&#039;s only natural as you are devoted hockey fans, but don&#039;t have the same pedigree as a hockey city. Montrealers who hate the Habs are usually people that go against everything coming their way...we call this group &quot;the pessimists&quot;.

Why was the Chara hit illegal? Easy, Chara looked up, saw the stanchion and held Max&#039;s head over the boards and gave him a final push to smack his head there. Did he mean to hurt him? Probably not. Just like Bertuzzi didn&#039;t mean to hurt Moore. But he should still be responsible for his actions. A hit from behind into the boards is the same thing...ya can&#039;t say &quot;the boards got in the way&quot;. The emotions got the best of Chara...I understand, I&#039;ve played this sport for a very long time. It happens...but that&#039;s what the referee and the league is their for. They really missed this one.

I agree, people shouldn&#039;t be calling 911.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You better believe that I high fived everyone after the middle finger was put up.
You also better believe that I high fived everyone after Chara hit the Pacioretty into the glass.
You better believe that I high fived everyone when he did it to another player last game.
You better believe it that I high fived everyone after Marchand scored the first goal, knowing what Mr.Pacioretty said over Twitter. Saying that this game is longer than his nose. Yes, hes got a big nose, and the game went into double over time, but class comes with not talking trash aswell. Subban is known for trash talking and being a complete jerk on the ice. 
Im just going to reinstate what I said above. I can&#039;t wait to hear about all the 911 rape calls after the Bruins dominate the Habs in Montreal Tuesday.
I hope you guys can enjoy the Bell center for one last time. After tuesday, you guys will have no more hockey, and a stadium torn up by butthurt fans
Good Game.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Commercials are sweet.   No question about it.  And while Ference could have controlled his emotions a little bit better,  You bet I high fived everyone at my local bar. You are foolish if you think that you and your other Habs fans wouldnt have done the same thing had Subban scored the goal and flipped the bird.

If the Bruins have to act in such a manner to get passion in their play then im all for it.  Their paychecks can handle the fines and it makes for some good television.]]></description>
