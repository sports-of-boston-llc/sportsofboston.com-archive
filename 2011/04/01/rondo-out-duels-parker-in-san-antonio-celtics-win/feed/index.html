		<description><![CDATA[Wow!!  Where did this come from?  What a pleasure to see two good teams playing so well, and even more of a pleasure to come out on top.  I guess we should sit Rondo down for a game on a regular basis.  His last two performances have been the Rondo of old, and where in the world did this jump shot accuracy come from?  Super performances by virtually everyone (oops - Ray Allen is in a slump), and even a ray of hope from Jermaine O&#039;Neal.

Was it just having a few days off and getting to practice a bit?  Guess we&#039;ll find out tonight in the dreaded second game of a back to back.  BTW, very good synopsis, Matt.]]></description>
