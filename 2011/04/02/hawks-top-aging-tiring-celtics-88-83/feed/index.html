		<description><![CDATA[about Sherrod, I think he was typing quick and either dropped a few words (maybe he meant &quot;when you go through a season&#039;s worth of injuries&quot;) or he simply spelled it wrong. Good close reading! haha]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yep.  You could tell the Celts would lose early in the third quarter when the Hawks were sleep walking out there, and the Celts suddenly couldn&#039;t hit the baskets that would have put the game away.  You just knew that if the Hawks could stay within ten while playing so poorly, they&#039;d overtake the Celts in the fourth.  And lo and behold......

BTW, K.C., please tell me that A. Sherrod Blakely didn&#039;t really spell &quot;throw&quot; as &quot;through&quot;.  Please!]]></description>
