		<description><![CDATA[Why cut him? There isnt an available position on this team for another big time play maker. We have two stud tight ends that are always on the field and then 83 and 84 who are gunna catch 80 percent of the balls tom throws them. If people really are expecting 85 to catch 6 balls for 80 yeards a week then they will continue to complain about 85 because theres no way he will do that. Its not his fault that the pats have four perfect players for the system they run. If 83 or 84 go down then chad will be able to step up. its hard to learn an entire new play book while adjusting from being the guy for ten years to playing a role for a really good team. Leave chad alone alan]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Matt, you are out to lunch.  Brady has thrown 85 several passes that he was expected to catch.  85 either missed his routes or dropped the ball.  Neither Brady, Belichick, nor the Patriots are &quot;ok&quot; with that.  Its time to cut 85 and bring in a player who can contribute.]]></description>
