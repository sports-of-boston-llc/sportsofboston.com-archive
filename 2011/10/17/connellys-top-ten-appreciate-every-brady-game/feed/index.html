		<description><![CDATA[- In 1981, gas averaged $1,38 - in no single year in the entire 1990&#039;s did gas ever exceed $1.24.

- I thought Henry definitely helped his cause on Friday. At first was concerned about sharing his not wanting Crawford, but then he went on to explain that he hires people to make those decisions.  By going with their advice, he&#039;s saying he trusts himself in who he hires.  It&#039;s traditional top-down management where everyone has their own expertise and it breeds confidence at every level, while keeping the org working at it&#039;s best.  He&#039;s a money &#038; investment guy, he is not a baseball guy (BTW, I do think the jury is still out on Crawford - he has had one bad season and we&#039;ve now learned he tried to rally a moribund dugout.  also, in his contract, he was paid $14, not $20, mill this year... check baseball reference -- still didn&#039;t play up to it, but again, 1 season so far).
- While I like 7 listen to Felg &#038; Mazz, thought they shapeshifted their argument when Henry said &#039;top Brass did not leak info&#039;.  They specifically called out the Top 3, then said &#039;well, you ARE responsible for any person that spills it in your org.&#039;
- Wonder what the Red Sox are going to give &#039;exclusive&#039;-wise to WEEI for Henry&#039;s drive-by interview at the competition?..
- Don&#039;t forget the Gillette themesong: &#039;The best a man can get&#039;, helping transition the piece from statement to satire.
-Sox lobbying for Castro so they can give the Rays something big enough to acquire Mr. Magoo for dughouse discipline.

REPLY - MPC - Good stuff / would you send Ellsbury along with Theo for a blockbuster that gets you Castro and someone else? /]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1) I think Wes Welker is returning kicks because of his ability to catch the ball and not fumble.  Still, I think he&#039;s too valuable and I don&#039;t like it either.

2) Fox copied the Vince Wilfork video from the internets.  The longer version on the internets is better (sorry I can&#039;t find a link).

3) The Bruins need to make faster passes and take quicker shots on their power plays.  It looks like they are running their offense in slow-motion, and every move is telegraphed to the defense.  They need less thinking and more action.

REPLY - MPC - Good note on the Wilfork stuff out there before / Bruins have to attack / on punt returns Faulk catches that ball everytime (if he&#039;s healthy)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, can&#039;t agree on Henry holding his own.  By stating that he didn&#039;t want to sign a player who they are now committed to for several years not only has to make Crawford wonder, but also brings into question his influence in making decisions.  I thought he actually poured high octane gas on the fire, but just my opinion.

REPLY - MPC - I think he sold his soul to get the point across that it didn&#039;t come from him on Tito - he won&#039;t be working at the United Nations anytime soon]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t agree with you more about the pink crap.  Breast cancer has hit me personally - huge family loss, but this is ridiculous.  I am tired of going to Pop Warner football games on Sunday mornings at 7:30 am and seeing a bunch of 7 and 8 year olds imitating the pros with pink socks and wrist bands and shoelaces etc, etc...
Half of them have those bracelets that say..&quot;Save the tatas&quot; and &quot;I love boobies&quot;.  Yesterday one of them was wearing a shirt that said &quot;Save second base&quot; under his shoulder pads.
At this point everyone is aware - enough with the pink and the slogans.  If you want to make a difference, ask every attendee to donate a dollar.

REPLY - MPC - Great note on a $1 a fan thats $68,000 and they should also get a commitment from NFL players at that game to match the amount]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Guyton and Light might want to donate this week&#039;s checks to the Blanket Fund. Both looked lost and Light was abused on two of the sacks. 

Give Henry an A+ for effort, but for a group that pays attention to the most minute detail to suggest they didn&#039;t know what was going on in the clubhouse is not even a sports fib, it&#039;s something much worse. And he did take a shot at Theo by saying he didn&#039;t tell them. So I guess it&#039;s Theo&#039;s fault they all became blind over the summer and couldn&#039;t see that Beckett was just plain fat.

REPLY - MPC - Henry went there to accomplish one thing and his mind doesn&#039;t have the capacity to switch focus to answer questions other than what he had on his list. He would be dangerous on a witness stand on in a deposition]]></description>
