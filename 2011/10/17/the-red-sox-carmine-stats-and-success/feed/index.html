No, I don&#039;t think anyone should just accept that the Red Sox know what they are doing, but one month, no matter how bad, should not discredit many years of work. Even the Yankees had a nearly decade long stagnent period where the team was good but not great.

Fans should be disappointed in how things ended and should put pressure on ownership and the fornt office to improve. This is a team that has the resources to fix nearly any problem over the winter. But we saw a great team for four months this season. That wasn&#039;t a fluke.

Baseball is a long haul during the season, players have a long developmental period, and the Red Sox face three very good teams in their own division. For now, I think the team still gets the benefit of the doubt. We&#039;ll see if they take action in baseball operations or marketing this winter.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So, Mr. Carlucci, are we as fans to just accept the &quot;we know better&quot; than you attitude that they have spewed now for years? While you say these guys are not robots, how can anybody believe that when they doled out the ridiculuous contracts to people who may have had great stats, but zero chance of succeeding here--John Lackey famously said &quot;I&#039;d like to blow the f&#039;ing place up!&quot; 5 years before they went out and acquired him. What could possibly have made them decide, hey, this guy will just love it when he gets here and he&#039;s going to be awesome? 
As a fan, I was and am thrilled with the effort and resources the team puts into the operation, but the track record seems to be pretty bad in the last few years, and there is ZERO explanation from the front office (Theo included) when questioned about how they could have missed so badly with so many star free agents. 
As I said to an out of town friend at the collapse being complete, it&#039;s not the worst thing in the world, Boston hasn&#039;t been angry in a while--perhaps the Sox need that to bring them back to reality--it&#039;s about winning, not consecutive sellouts, not TV ratings, not &quot;the official health care partner&quot;, not kid&#039;s annnouncer day, not &quot;order will be restored&quot; campaigns. Ironically, the Bruins figured that out, while the Sox lost it.]]></description>
