		<description><![CDATA[Very interesting comment that you like the makeup with this Bruins Team even though last year with basically the same lineup (minus Recci and Ryder....Kaerble came after you made the comment) that they couldn&#039;t make it past the second round.....So why the change of heart? Oh that&#039;s right because the won the CUP!!! Can you say Fair Weather!!!!  

Or is it because you think this is a better team without Recci/Ryder? 


Small Guys= The Rat

REPLY - MPC - Sorry I was partially wrong once in the last thirty-eight years.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[-Thanks for being the first person in Boston sports print to question why Varitek, the captain, has received -0- criticism. I have seen Youk and Papi ripped for not doing anything, but nothing on VAritek.  Varitek&#039;s 2 remaining redeeming qualities were leadership (allegedly) and being the great &quot;pitcher whisperer.&quot; How did that work out for us?  Can someone name a bigger sacred cow in Boston sports history than Varitek? If they bring him back next year that will be an insult.

-Russell Martin, .237 for the season and .176 for the playoffs.  He hates the Sox but we love him!

-New Yankee Stadium just doesn&#039;t bring it like the old place did.

-Good for Detroit on all fronts!

REPLY - MPC - I guess that makes his legacy fraudulent....I agree on Yankee Stadium and the Montreal Forum not the same insane intensity.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Still can&#039;t watch the entire scene from Misery, OUCH!!!

Dee Brown as a small guy winning the slam dunk, seriously, a Celtic winning the slam dunk contest is pretty good.  Don&#039;t think he liked being in Wellesley though.]]></description>
