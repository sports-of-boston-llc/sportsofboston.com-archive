		<description><![CDATA[there is nothing wrong with Josh Beckett and I think fans like him.  He is a great pitcher and he tells it as it is which I like.  He is getting blamed for all this beer stuff in the clubhouse come one so if he had two beers big deal..the rest of the pitchers are big boys if they want to have beer then have them...he doesn&#039;t have to be the leader for that.  They are grown men and blame them for having beer in the clubhouse not just Josh. He is a great pitcher and is the ace of the sox&#039;s.  They are not going to trade him.  Sox would have been in 4th place this year if it hadn&#039;t been for Josh.  I say GO JOSH keep up the great work we love you!!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To me it&#039;s his attitude that sucks. He&#039;s a guy who has everything- one of the top pitchers in the game, 2 rings, all the girls he wants... but always seems pissed off and hostile. Don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever seen him smile, ever. 

He&#039;s a great pitcher, amazing under pressure, and doesn&#039;t make excuses when he loses. In terms of his on-field performance, other than being a little injury-prone, you can&#039;t ask any more of him.]]></description>
