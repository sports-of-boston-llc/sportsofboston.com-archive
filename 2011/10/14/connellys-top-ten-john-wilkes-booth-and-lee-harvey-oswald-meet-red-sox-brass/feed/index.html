		<description><![CDATA[Agreed both NBA players and owners are clueless, meet in the middle and get on with it before public forgets the league exists. 
But it is not a holdout. The owners locked out the players from a deal the owners themselves signed off on and could have extended another year per the terms of the agreement. Please call it what it is - a lockout. 

Sam Bam should have and could have gotten more touches, too often used solely as a blocking back. Great player. Better than little bro Randall. 

Why couldn&#039;t Sox get good lefties like Tudor and Ojeda? Wait a minute ...

No surprise in game you cited Cs won!

REPLY - MPC - Wilt stats - Russell wins / Imagine Sox could have Ojeda, Tudor and Hurst in their prime / In my book Great Book of Boston Sports Lists - I list Sam Bam in my top ten over-rated - especially after running out of bounds vs. Raiders in 1976]]></description>
