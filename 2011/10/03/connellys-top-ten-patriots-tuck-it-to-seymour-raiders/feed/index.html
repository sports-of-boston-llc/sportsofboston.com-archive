		<description><![CDATA[What about LSU? Two best teams in the nation, come from the same conference in the same division. 

Is Clemson last years Auburn? 

Pats will win 12-14 games but we all know the season starts in January. 

Who will win a playoff game next? Pats or Red Sox?

REPLY - MPC - I don&#039;t think LSU can do it at QB - Jefferson other than the bowl last year has never impressed me (boy is that defense fast though) / No on Clemson - not the same magic - they will lose three games / Bad thing about PAts 16-0 and 14-2 season - they made regular season useless]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[* I had thought that most or all teams had stopped providing or allowing alcohol in thier clubhouses/locker rooms, if only to avoid any legal liability problems.  It&#039;s not the 70&#039;s or the 80&#039;s anymore. That should have been an easy organizational fix. Players can leave the park/stadium &#038; drink on their own after the game. 
* Everyone says the loss of Mayo will be devestating to the Pats&#039; defense, but in reality, how much worse can it possibly get?
* Is Jermaine Cunningham in the Witness Protection Program?  When will Ron Brace be healthy enough to release?  
* Bill Belichick deservedly earned his reputation as a genius defensive coach.  I think it&#039;s a little odd then, that as far as being in charge of assembling the team goes (&#039;buying the groceries&#039;), Belichek has much better in drafting, signing, and trading for offensive players than he has been at selecting defensive players. Weird.

REPLY - MPC - Didn&#039;t a CArolina Hurricane die after drinking in locker room and team plane / Cunningham I thought was the key to this defense coming into the season but he&#039;s hanging out with JD Drew. We might find how much worse this team can get with Guyton]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[-Agree, Giambi was safe, thought he was safe live. Still a great play by Jeter.

-Books. Fair journalism.  This country inundates you with dirt on people and showing people at their lowest or trashiest moments for entertainment (reality TV, Cops, Jerry Springer. Can&#039;t have it both ways. 

-So Varitek wears the &quot;C&quot; and seemingly does nothing to police the club house.  Does the love affair finally, mercifully end?

-Pats seem to play most of their games in nickel defense.  Frustrating to watch...

-Agree on the Yankee-Tiger game Friday night. They wanted to get it in at all costs to take advantage of the no sports on Friday night TV. Pathetic.

-MPC, great poll would be to ask Sox fans what 5 players would you keep for the next year, the rest have to go. Some might ask &quot;I have to come up with 5?&quot;

REPLY - MPC - My top 5 - of course Pedroia the guy is amazing, Lester (he needs an attitude adjustment though), Ellsbury (gotta pay him), Gonzalez (he&#039;s not a gamer but is integral to a lineup - I&#039;m having a tough time finding a must keep after this despite the $160mm payroll / Varitek leaves on a bad note thats for sure as does Wakefield]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bob Stoops made an interesting observation about a college football playoff.  The schools look at a bowl game as an event for the school - where the team, the students, the administration, and alumni use it as a reunion and travel to the bowl game en mass. (Don&#039;t use BC as the benchmark)
If there is a multiple game playoff format, then how could the schools organize an &quot;event&quot; that has become tradition in college football.  The sport is different.  You can&#039;t play more than one football game per week - it&#039;s not basketball or hockey or baseball where you can play twice in a weekend.  Players can&#039;t walk without pain until Wednesday after a Saturday game.
Fans and students would wait to see if their team won, because people can&#039;t afford multiple destination events per year in back to back weeks.  The only thing that would work is to have the higher ranked team host the event as a home game.  (This would accomplish the dream of eliminating sterile pro venues vs. electric college venues - think LSU&#039;s home stadium as opposed to the Superdome).  Rose Bowl should be mandated by a Constitutional ammendment to host every National Championship game if this ever happened by the way.

I think that a plus one format would be the best way to preserve tradition and minimize the chances of a team getting jobbed.  I don&#039;t want the regular season to get diminished.  Every week is a round of the playoffs for Alabama, Oklahoma and Wisconsin as it stands right now.

REPLY - MPC - The regular season is now 12 -13 games they could stop the season end of November or first week of December and take it through mid January which they do now anyways. I think you could definitely get crowds to travel at least to two games a semi-final and final. But the other rounds I would have no problem going home games for higher seed teams.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Couldn&#039;t agree more about that Giambi-Jeter play. In all the discussion about Moneyball - Hey, the As never won, so what? - people forget they wuz robbed that year. 
Also, I have in my little news corner of the world written the same thing: College football playoffs would be a gold mine. If the current bowl people were smart, they would jump on, and rotate the games among the major bowls: eight-team playoff = seven games, lots of lucre for all. The No. 9 team can whine, but that&#039;s better than the No. 3 team being jobbed

REPLY - MPC - Thats exactly what the bowl organizers haven&#039;t understood - in an eight team playoff (I would prefer 16) they could have 7 bowl games - and the teams that don&#039;t make it play in the other bowl games - everyone wins]]></description>
