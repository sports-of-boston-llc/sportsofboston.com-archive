		<description><![CDATA[How can Larussa be blamed for Ankiel&#039;s meltdown? That is outrageous.  You start your 11-7 3.50 rookie of the year candidate in the first round of the playoffs; he&#039;s inexplicably all over the place; you yank him after 2 innings.  What else would you have had LaRussa do?

REPLY - MPC - Shouldn&#039;t the guy in the Foster Grants who is so vain that he allowed a writer to follow him for three days to write about how cerebral he is and smart. While then he should have had his finger on the pulse of his players and understood Ankiel&#039;s makeup.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll still take Michael Haynes over Revis, unless Revis also starts returning punts for TDs.
Fun to note top three payroll teams (Yankees, Phillies, Sox, in that order) all lost one-run elimination games. A collective $537 million just doesn&#039;t buy what it used to. 
Also good from Robin Williams: Moscow on the Hudson and Cadillac Man.

REPLY - MPC - I think guys like Haynes and Deion Sanders and Champ Bailey are better athletes and instinct than Revis - I think Revis is glue where those guys jump routes and had amazing closing speed]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Reid and Tito Francona can start a club for guys who 4 weeks ago thought they had their jobs for life and might be out of work. 

Philly and NYC teams went 0-5 this weekend. Might be best weekend in history with 2 teams bounced from playoffs, another dealing with a mutiny and a fourth where the top paper in philly lead with a fire reid column this am. 

sanchez is romo-loves the job more than winning.

globe is right, time to part with tek and wake. 

ron washington-the guy from moneyball might win a world series this year as coach of texas. 

big 10 sports are always overrated. they choke in march. 

average age of steelers starting defense is 32 and their o-line is so bad they hired a guy who was retired to be their starting left tackle. 

hard not to root for a packers coach who started his career by working at a tollbooth.

REPLY - MPC - Sanchez and Romo I see as opposites when it matters / Four weeks ago Francona knew he had to leave town / Great NY weekend / yes on Packers coach / Hats off to Nolan Ryan for sticking with Washington]]></description>
