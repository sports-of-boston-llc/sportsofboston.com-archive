		<description><![CDATA[• Your Oct. 17, 2011 (less than 2-weeks ago) post had the following headline: “Connelly’s Top Ten: Appreciate Every Brady Game”.  Today you say that: “There is a direct correlation between Tom Brady’s mood and his performance – he seemed indifferent”.  Does that mean we should still “appreciate” a player who is “indifferent”?

•Thanks for pointing out Kraft &#038;  his higher chair.  That always drives me crazy.  Didn’t Caesar have a higher chair than the rest of his entourage at the Roman Coliseum?  “Prince Jonathan” is higher than the rest of the peasants in the box, too.

REPLY - MPC - He&#039;s not perfect and we should point that out but he&#039;s still the greatest QB they ever lived!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That was one of the worst defensive games I have ever watched.  I am starting to become frustrated with Belichick - he has had 7 years to fix this!!!

REPLY - MPC - Its not easy to watch - amazingly they played that bad and had a chance to win - they are built for regular season I&#039;m sorry to say they will still win at least 12 games]]></description>
