		<description><![CDATA[Theo’s ad is reminiscent of Drew Bledsoe’s departure message. But something troubles me: the logo for the Foundation to be Named Later at the bottom suggests that the charity might have paid for the advertisement. I hope that’s not the case. Also, one of the photos appears to belong to the Red Sox. Do you think they gave permission?

REPLY - MPC - I think the mention and logo of the charity is just another opportunity to brand their good works and get the word out there to literature that would get a lot of eyes on it. I am guessing that check was written by Theo himself. The picture I&#039;m sure was given proper permissions - considering the Globe was making a pretty penny they might have made a couple of their pictures available]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You forgot one of the more recent name changes - Ron Artest with the  name of Metta World Peace - ironic name given some of his actions, including the fight with the fan in the stands

REPLY - MPC - Good one - no doubt he&#039;s covering a lot of corners of the psych book over the years]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I find it really odd that MLB is allowing Theo to officially become President of the Cubs before the compensation is agreed to.  Selig says the compensation deal doesn&#039;t need to be reached until Nov. 1, a week after Theo&#039;s press conference with the Cubs.  That&#039;s weird. It takes a lot of pressure off the Cubs to give in to the Red Sox to pry Theo free when Theo is already there. My guess is that MLB will have to decide what the compensation package will be.

REPLY - MPC - I think you have it that MLB is going to decide so the two parties have no say in it anyways or they already decided and will wait for after World Series for any player movement]]></description>
