		<description><![CDATA[I am mostly blown away by the fact that these guys got away with it. That&#039;s a lot of devoted people protecting them... I&#039;m just shocked by the news.

What is more disheartening is that it is harder for me to remember &quot;the good guys&quot; than it is to remember the bad ones. AKA - It&#039;s hard to remember WHICH players DIDN&#039;T act like idiots.

		<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t agree more, especially about Lester.  In September, Beckett reminded me of no one so much as Mickey Lolich of the 1968 Tigers.  He seemed to have trouble getting around his increasing gut.  I have no use for Lackey.  He&#039;s arrogant without any reason to be so, careless with his pitches, and always willing to throw his teammates under the bus.  I&#039;d be fine with getting rid of Beckett and Lackey and adding a couple of younger arms to complement Lester and Buchholz.  They have to get those two away from the influence of Beckett and Lackey, or they&#039;ll ruin two potentially outstanding pitchers.]]></description>
