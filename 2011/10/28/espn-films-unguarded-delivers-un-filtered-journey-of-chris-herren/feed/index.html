		<description><![CDATA[I watched it last night and silently wept for his talent wasted, for his family who he continued to drag through 15 years of hell, for his basic goodness and the love of those closest to him. He wasn&#039;t ready to find help until he hit the 4th or 5th (I lost count) bottom, but in the end, and I hope it is the end, he finally emerges victorious. What a wonderful, heart wrenching story with incredible video footage. Herren shoots and finally scores!]]></description>
