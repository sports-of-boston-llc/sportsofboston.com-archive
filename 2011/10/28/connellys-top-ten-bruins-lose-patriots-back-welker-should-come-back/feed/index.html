		<description><![CDATA[Bill Cowher said it best. I want Tebow as my son-in-law but not as my starting quarterback. Sums it up for me. 

I hope Tebow is in the spotlight for years. He makes this country a better place. He has been under the microscope ever since he stepped on campus in Gainesville. What has he done wrong? I&#039;ll answer that for you, nothing. We need more Tebow&#039;s and less of Delonte West and others like West.

REPLY - MPC - I don&#039;t know if I would pick West as the Anti-Tebow. I think he&#039;s more a sad soul. But I get your point ie. (Pac Man Jones I submit)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[- Doc rivers not long for Boston, didn&#039;t he sign a 5 year extension at the end of the season for $35 million or something, or is my memory fading....I would put money on Claude being next to go ahead of Doc, but probably the Cup bought him a year or two.  Bill goes when Brady goes, maybe. 
- Sandler does SUCK, I hoped to see him when he has been in Boston and just start a slow chant &quot;Little Nicky, Little Nicky&quot;
- Eddie Murphy Delerious was excellent.  Tell me honestly MPC, you didn&#039;t do  the Eddie Murphy Mr. T as a gay man impersonation just like every other high school kid did at the time &quot;hmmm I pity the fool...&quot;

REPLY - MPC - Eddie Murphy&#039;s best work was Saturday Night Live / I think Doc made a brilliant move signing last year knowing that the lock out was legit and that he could get paid for half a year and then hang it up - five years was to give the appearance that he was serious - He will never serve that whole contract]]></description>

MPC, we&#039;ll agree to disagree on BHC. Fully agree on Trading Places.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[*I agree that the B’s had some luck in winning the Cup last year, but you can probably say that about any team that wins the Cup.  This is especially true with injuries.  The B’s were paper thin on defense last year (not much deeper this year).  Shane Hnidy was their #7 defenseman, while they were trying to limit/hide Kaberle as their #6 defenseman.  They lucked out that they never lost any of their top-5 defenseman for any length except for Chara’s 1-game lost against the Habs &#038; McQuaid’s 2-games against the Flyers.  In both circumstances, Hnidy came in &#038; played minimal minutes.  If any of the top-5 D had been knocked out for the entire playoffs, the B”s would have been toast.

* I disagree, however, that the Capitals were in “disarray” last season.  They were the #1 seed in the East &#038; went 16-3-1 in their last 20-regular season games.  They then took out the Rangers in 5-games in the 1st round of the playoffs.  They imploded when they were swept by the Lightening in the 2nd round, but that is their history.  The Capitals &#038; Alex Ovechkin are like the Colts &#038; Peyton Manning before they won the Super Bowl.  You won’t believe it until you see it.

* I agree that the Flyers had no goalie last year, but they had no goalie the previous year &#038; still came back from 0-3 to beat the B’s.  The big rumor about last year’s Flyers was that their captain, Mike Richards, &#038; a top goal scorer, Jeff Carter, were embracing the lifestyle that one would associate with the Red Sox starting rotation (off-ice &#038; not in the locker-room, however).  It supposedly caused a split between them &#038; Laviolette &#038; many of their teammates.  Both were traded in the off-season, &#038; the money was used to sign a goalie (Bryzgalov).
* I love David Krejci as a player, but he looks brutal.  If he’s hurt, sit him.  If he’s not hurt, I would put him back with Lucic &#038; Horton &#038; hope for a re-ignition.  I would, also, put Seguin on wing with Bergeron &#038; Marchand.  

*Dump Benoit Pouliot, &#038; let Caron play for 10-straight games.  Of course, now that I wrote that, Pouliot will score 2-goals against the Habs on Saturday night.

REPLY - MPC - I agree with your point that a lot of teams that win a championship do so because things fall right for them but with that said the Bruins had significant flaws last year that are rearing their head this year - mainly lack of sniper and quality depth - they need two more good players with one being Dino Cicarelli type]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a father of 4 young girls and 2 young boys, I love having Tim Tebow in the public eye.  He does things right.  He&#039;s genuine.  He&#039;s humble.  He&#039;s a tremendous role model for boys - he provides an example of how to live like a man.  He&#039;s an example of the type of man you teach your daughters to expect.
I love the way he plays football, but I think he&#039;s so much bigger than that.  People have been trying to find an inconsistency for years and haven&#039;t.  I&#039;d take him on my team in a blink.  Try to find someone who has played with him that doesn&#039;t respect him and like him.  I hope he does well - people like him bring society up.  

There are too many guys &quot;keepin&#039; it real&quot; on the other side - so I&#039;m glad that Tebow is out there being himself.

I doubt Tebow has ever thought that God cares who wins his games -he&#039;s never mentioned wins - he&#039;s been thankful for his gifts and opportunities.  He&#039;s a gamer - he&#039;ll go after the wins himself.

REPLY - MPC - I agree with everything you said - I&#039;m a huge Tebow fan and wish for his success not just because I want him to do well but also so that his persona will get even more attention. Apples and oranges comparison but when Bird and Magic started to be popular kids started going to the playground trying to make great passes as opposed to just shooting - hoping that the Tebow quality will spread]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[C&#039;mon, got to give Eddie credit for the first Beverly Hills Cop!
Stanley live was breathtaking. 
If Tebow goes 6-for-23 for 73 yards and rushes 5 times for 12 yards in 20-point loss to Lions, is that God&#039;s will? Or does the Supreme Being have more important things to do than follow sports?

REPLY - MPC - I watched BHC recently and it was contrived over the top with his forced laugh / Tebow would give thanks anyways - I would have to say its a private relationship and does the relationship a disservice making it so public]]></description>
