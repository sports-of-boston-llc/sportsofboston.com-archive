		<description><![CDATA[I wanted to put Carolina higher in the rankings, but their defense is pretty porous and Cam Newton has been shaky recently.  I think a lot of people fell in love with Newton after Weeks 1 and 2, and are overlooking what he&#039;s doing these past couple weeks.

As for Dallas, their defense just held the Patriots to 20 points, so they&#039;re clearly talented.  The offense is hit or miss, I&#039;ll admit, but I think they&#039;ve played better and more consistent football over these six weeks than teams 16-22.  Houston is who we thought they were, Atlanta has looked out of sorts, the Jets are playing as if they&#039;re taking advice from Plaxico Burress, the Bears offensive line appears to be playing in quick sand,  and the &#039;Skins are falling apart behind lackluster QB play.

I agree with what you say about the Packers - no way they stay undefeated, but I could easily see them going 13-3, 14-2, something like that.  I&#039;ll be interested to see them play @SD and @DET to see how they do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think Carolina should be higher despite only having one win, not much higher but a few spots up. Dallas is not better than teams 16-22. Sure you can always find good things to say about them but they find ways to lose. I want to see th Packers get down big in a game and see how they handle it. The Nfl has more competitive teams this year then they have in along time, no way the defending champs can keep the 0 for the entire season]]></description>
