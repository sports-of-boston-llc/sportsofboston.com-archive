		<description><![CDATA[-MPC, you nailed it with the sports toys, I had everyone of them.  Those were the days!

-Well put on Garnett, so well put...

-Do you think Tebow takes the Pats bad secondary bait and runs less and throws more?

-OK, follow me here.  Sam Hurd, self-proclaimed Christian quietly (by sports media standards) gets popped for being a drug kingpin and yet Tebow is the annoying  Christian guy? I know Hurd is a far lesser known player, but do American sports fans ever realize what sheep they are to the sports media?

REPLY - MPC - American Sports fans should look at the part in Bull Durham where Costner is teaching Robbins how to talk to press / Tebow should have some holes to throw into]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Orr vs Oates? In 92/93 the regular season went to 84 games (78 in 70/71) giving Orr 1.78 points/game versus Oates 1.69 points/game.  Dilution effect?  14 teams in 70/71 versus 24 teams in 92/93.  More impressive, Orr had to share the glory.  Espo set records for goals and points (76/152), Bruins had top four scorers and seven of the top ten.  They set the records for points at center/Espo, left w/Bucyk, right w/Hodge, def/Orr.  Are we sure they didn&#039;t win the cup that year? Stats via Wikipedia.

REPLY - MPC - Good stats]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When Childe Bobby entered the NHL, the record for points by a defenseman was 59.  He peaked at 139 and scored over 100 for six straight seasons.  Before his arrival, no defenseman or forward had ever reached that mark.

For two of those early 1970&#039;s seasons, Havlicek finished 2nd and 4th in scoring and was amongst the top five in the league in assists.

The very first game played in the old AFL was the Broncos vs. the Pats at Nickerson Field.  The Broncos won that one too 13-10.

		<description><![CDATA[Super Jock field goal was an awesome toy!  The Roger Staubach super QB arm was the only one better.

I heard Garnett on the radio the other day and he openned with a statement about how people don&#039;t understand what they went through - I immediately changed the station.  He&#039;s a tool.

Couldn&#039;t be happier for Tim Tebow.  I&#039;m happy for the rest of us as well - we need more people like him in the public eye.  Seeing media people like Michael Strahan contort themselves to find a negative is unbelievable.

Amazing Orr put that many points up as a solid defenseman.  He did it without Neely next to him as well.

REPLY - MPC - Now kids play a video game and go blind / Orr greatest hockey player of all time no doubt]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Elway looking dumber and dumber, I love that. 

I hope NE beats the Broncos like an egg, watching Elway cringe--priceless. Elway owned the Patriots in his career. I don&#039;t think he ever lost to the Pats. 

Will the Celtics get past the 1st rd. of the playoffs? Heat, Bulls are clearly better and the Knicks might win the division. Getting Chandler was big for the Knicks.

Only thing worse regarding snow, shoveling out your driveway and a bunch of plows come down the streer later and slamming you in. You accomplished nothing and you&#039;ll have to do it over again.

REPLY - MPC - Funny thing about plows - I&#039;m on a one way and get plowed back in every time while across the street its like the Sahara desert. Celtics better hope they qualify the playoffs with an unhappy point guard]]></description>
