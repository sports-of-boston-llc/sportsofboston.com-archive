		<description><![CDATA[Well Matt looks like small adjustment needed after N.O. went down. Pat&#039;s in line for the # 27 pick now. How about this scenario:
 Pat&#039;s offer 1#32, 2#48, and a player (Brace, Guyton, or White) to Phili for 1#15. 
 It&#039;s possable Upshaw could slip down there but if he doesn&#039;t Donta&#039;Hightower likely would be there. An upgrade for sure @ RLB. Would Phili consider this in your opinion?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great but how will that get done? Upshaw will likely go between # 10 &#038; # 16 in first. looks like it would take three high draft picks to get into that range, yes/no?]]></description>
