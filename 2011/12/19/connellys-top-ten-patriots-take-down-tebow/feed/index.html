		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer&quot; has no peer as worst Xmas song ever. 

I was real happy Denver trotted out that field goal unit. You don&#039;t beat Patriots with three-pointers. 

Did Yaz thank Jesus for every RBI in &#039;67? I think not. Save that stuff for Sunday morning and works of charity. 
I, too, loved that album. 
Still wish they&#039;d given the ball to Santiago in Game 7, though. Two days for Lonborg not enough.

Think if Greenberg&#039;s name was Smith or Jones he would have won MVP in &#039;38? Yup.

REPLY - MPC - No doubt on Greenberg although Williams got the same rip off when a Yankee second baseman won / I agree on Grandma got run over - terrible]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Celtics will make the playoffs but will get bounced out in rd. 1 or rd.2 

Will Romeo do enough to take the &quot;interim&quot; tag off of his name? 

Eagles will win the division. 

How about those Jets, got crushed in Philly. 

How would Gronkowski and Hernandez do against the Pats &quot;D&quot;??? They would have a field day. 

Andre Carter, big loss!

Cardinal and Cowboys should be a fun Fiesta Bowl. Lots of points. Cowboys might be a little fast for the Cardinal. 

I also believe FSU and Notre Dame in Orlando should be a fun bowl. 

Michigan State and Ga., too. 

If TB adds a bat, they will the AL.

REPLY - MPC - Said in Globe that Tampa has eight starters - wow / Michigan State bores me for whatever reason / Florida State bores me too and Kelly&#039;s act is wearing thin / No on Romeo / Eagles would be the team no one wants to play if they end up 8-8]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hernandez ball hit the ground!  Good decision by BB not to challenge.

Dickey was a catcher.

The Chiefs were celebrating like they just got let out of jail.  But I think it would be a mistake to give Crennel the job.  He was a complete disaster in Cleveland, overmatched by the demands of the position.

REPLY - MPC - I agree on Crennel nice memory for him / Catcher or not thats not close / close on Hernandez]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cs make playoffs, but are out in the first round.  no way they still can&#039;t at least get to the playoffs with the geezers and rondo.

isn&#039;t it interesting to see GB lose?  KC has 1 pass rusher, but the whole team played like hell on wheels for 4 quarters.  rodgers wildly uncomfortable all day.

brady wanted to get the 2nd TD rushing to prove a point... that it&#039;s all about him these days!  not so great...

REPLY - MPC - Brady has an ego no doubt but that drives him (similar to Pedro), perfect storm in KC game, Celts - Pierce bad heel, Garnett something, Rondo unhappy - 33-33]]></description>
