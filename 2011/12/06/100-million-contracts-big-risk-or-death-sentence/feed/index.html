		<description><![CDATA[I’m not defending these overwhelmingly large contracts, but there are two (2) major points are not mentioned in this article.

1) Salary Inflation
Salary inflation for sports is much greater than ‘normal’ inflation. One good indication is the league minimum. In 2011 it was $414k and by 2013 it will rise to $500k as outlined in the new CBA. That’s over a 20% growth in 3 years. If the minimum league salary can grow so rapidly, then what’s stopping free agent prices from growing? (Absolutely Nothing)

Conversely, salary inflation for ‘normal’ people is typically 3% a year.


2) Long term contracts are not necessary paid in level payments.

From those two points, it is sometimes possible to say it was ‘fair’ to sign someone to a long term deal. Ten years from now, the value of $20m will have declined. Why? Because inflation will cause league salaries will have rise accordingly. 

I’ll illustrate an example using Miguel Cabrera’s contract:
Miggy is signed to a $152/8yr contract; however, the payments can vary between years, depending on the contract. 

2008 salary: $11m – 2nd arbitration season
2009 salary: $15m – 3rd arbitration season
2010 salary: $20m – covers the free agency years
2011 salary: $20m
2012 salary: $21m
2013 salary: $21m
2014 salary: $22m
2015 salary: $22m

On AVERAGE, Miggy earns a $19m/yr, and by the end of 8 years, he will have earned $152m.

In the early seasons, Miggy clearly outperformed his annual salary, so the Tigers have some surplus value. By 2015, Miggy’s performance will have sharply declined, but his annual salary remains relatively unchanged. 

A) You could argue that because of Miggly’s former surplus value can largely cover the deficits he will create later in his career. This is one method of curbing against future deficits.

B) Miggy’s performance will decline, but at the same time, salaries will have risen. By 2015, it is expected that the dollar value for performance will have risen as well. Again this can curb against future deficits.

Simply, everything I’ve said accumulates to the following: 
If the GM is smart forecaster, he will be able to protect himself from the risk of future deficits. Namely, the GM must be competent in predicting how a player will decline, and how salary inflation will affect the market. 

Case in point, look at Dave Stieb’s contract.

Back in 1985, Pat Gillick the GM of the Toronto Blue Jays, signed Stieb to an $16.6m/11yr contract, with escalator clauses to a total possible value of $25m. This made Stieb one of the highest paid players in baseball! (believe it or not)

Gillick took a lot of heat for negotiating such a risky contract, but 6 years later, it was Stieb who ended up regretting that contract. Salaries exploded (completely due to inflation) and by 1991 over 36 pitchers were earning more than Stieb, many of whom were clearly inferior. 

So whilst all of the aforementioned contracts are large and risky, VERY FEW of them are actually ‘death sentences’. Just be smart about offering large contracts.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh...I&#039;m not the same guest who called the author a moron. I agree, that name calling on the internet is uncalled for!

I agree that a good number of the big money deals won&#039;t work out, but I think some will. Also, it&#039;s worth noting that while Gonzalez might not be worth $20 million a year in the last years of his deal, he may be worth MORE than $20 million in a few of the early years of the deal. That, plus inflation, may help some of these deals look good in the future.

I think the key to one of these deals is signing a guy who&#039;s under 30, has an athletic body, and who has a mix of skills. The one dimensional, big bodied, over 30 player is a bad bet, for sure.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fair enough, but it’s a little harsh to call the author a moron for being skeptical. Gonzalez’ contract DOES look nice right now, but you’d be dreaming if you think he will produce numbers worthy of $20 MM a season in year 7.

This article only covers players that are currently signed to deals voer $100 MM.  Jeter is not currently one of those players.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just think it&#039;s silly to judge a deal before it starts. What I think doesn&#039;t matter. I&#039;m saying we can&#039;t KNOW...both how these guys perform and what contracts will look like in 5+ years. For example, doesn&#039;t Adrian Gonzalez&#039; contract already look better in lieu of what Pujols (and eventually Fielder) sign for? Also, Derek Jeter&#039;s 10 year contract appears to have been ignored by this article.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How can you claim to know that a contract is &quot;NOT WORTH THE MONEY/ SOME PRODUCTION&quot; if it hasn&#039;t even started yet?
