		<description><![CDATA[Scam Newton is a stud... Panthers will upset the Falcons this weekend.

What, you don&#039;t like the Red Sox?  You don&#039;t think that it&#039;s a holly jolly holiday season down at the Fens?  What&#039;s wrong with celebrating a division title 2 months early by getting obese and arrogant???

I can&#039;t wait to see which bum off the street starts for the defense this weekend.  Too bad they don&#039;t have any more Sunday night games just so we can look at the still pictures of nameless defensemen with no voiceover... good times.

REPLY - MPC -  Newton is an amazing athlete and monster size - could be good but someone with his character could go way of Roethlisberger / Sox bringing back Ortiz after he admitted he won&#039;t lead and cares about stats and won&#039;t run down to first / Belichick might call you for nose guard]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Baugh was so good he once led the NFL in passing, punting and interceptions. It is widely believed his long and accurate passes did for pro football what Ruth&#039;s homeruns did for baseball. A sportswriter dubbed him the nickname &quot;Slingin&#039; Sammy&quot; after seeing him making throws on the baseball diamond.

Elgin Baylor was drafted by the Minneapolis Lakers and played his entire career for that franchise.  Jamaal (Keith) Wilkes can make that list though.

Alastair Sim best Christmas Carole.

REPLY - MPC - You&#039;re in good company on Alastair Sim / Good help on Baylor / Good note on nickname Slinging comes from baseball - I think he went to TCU and threw some no hitters]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Grinch is not over-rated!

Can&#039;t wait to see who wins the Heisman.  It&#039;s funny the group think that takes place in the process.  There are so many who seem to think they are supposed to vote for Luck or Richardson because that&#039;s what everyone is saying.  Ball has a better year going than Richardson and Griffin has a better year than Luck.  Neither Luck nor Griffin has a stable of superstar receivers.  Both are impressive, but I think Griffin is the best.

It&#039;s interesting - I thought that Richardson was better than Ingram the year that Ingram won it.

Mathieu disqualified himself by smoking dope, in my opinion.  He&#039;s great, but I can&#039;t overlook that punk move.

REPLY - MPC - MAthieu cheap shot on Alabama player bad also / I had Barkley up there on my list but I heard someone say that I agree with his weapons are insane / Ball is a great story of re-dedicating himself this summer / I&#039;m not a big Dr. Seuss fan - but watch every year though]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kraft sticking up for his coaches, players, and of course his wallet. Team will get in around 2:00 a.m. instead of 6:00 a.m. or 7:00 a.m. 

That is what an owner should need if he has the power. The hoodie and his staff are happy about that. 

Last time Pats played the Skins down there, Spurrier beat the Pats. Then NE went on that longgg winning streak. 

Newton is a freaking superstar! He is having fun out there. Just think, Urban Myer had Brantley ahead of Newton, now that is funny!

Weis to Kansas(strange move) I don&#039;t think Sayers is available to play for the Jayhawks. Weis has made some &quot;odd decisions&quot; ever since he left Foxboro/Foxborough.

REPLY - MPC - Interesting on Weis he had some legit weapons at Florida and got nothing / Spurrier who I love in college didn&#039;t win much in NFL / I love the 4 start for Pats]]></description>
