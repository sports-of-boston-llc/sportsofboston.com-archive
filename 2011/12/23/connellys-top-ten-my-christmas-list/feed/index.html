		<description><![CDATA[Great list, no Boston sports fan could argue with your list. 

Chris Berman to go away, he lost his fastball long ago. While I&#039;m at it, take Tom Jackson with you. The Patriots hate their coach, only a fool would say that and believe that. 

Jim Nantz and Phill Simms to go away, boring broadcasts and no insight. 

Shannon Sharpe and Sterling Sharpe leaves. Sterling never spoke with the media but is part of the media now. I dislike when athletes do that. 

Merry Christmas MPC.

REPLY - MPC - Good stuff - thanks for reading and your comments!]]></description>
