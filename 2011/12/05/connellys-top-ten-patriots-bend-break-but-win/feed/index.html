		<description><![CDATA[Tebow continues to roll.  He could have won it with a touchdown pass that was a beautifully thrown ball into the endzone, but the receiver dropped it.

I agree with Robert Griffin III winning the Heisman - he&#039;s unreal.

It&#039;s a shame that West Virginia is in the BCS and Boise State loses by missing a field goal to a ranked team and will go to a no-name bowl.

REPLY - MPC - The thing Tebow haters don&#039;t realize that he is only going to get more comfortable with his throwing and reading defenses / BCS is a disgrace - West Virginia terrible - as Game Day was saying come right out next year with a four team semi&#039;s and then adjust that  / RGIII is a first ten pick - he&#039;s tough also - needs to learn how to roll to his left though]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was at the BU/BC basketball game on Saturday backing BU.  BC fans are non-existent.  Conte was empty.  You also can&#039;t have 10 white guys on the roster and not be named Duke and expect to win.  They were outhustled, outrebounded, outshot, outeverything.

REPLY - MPC - Take away hockey from the Heights its embarrassing]]></description>
