		<description><![CDATA[When I pressed the &quot;only decent center&quot; link in this article, up popped Kendrick Perkins.  Imagine my surprise!  Perhaps Matt doesn&#039;t have access to the incredible statistics he put together for Oklahoma City.  Hey, Matt, check out Perk&#039;s stats in last year&#039;s playoffs, and have a good laugh at calling this guy a decent center.  Oklahoma was so thrilled with his performance that they kept him on the bench at crunch time - exactly where he belonged.  Check those stats for rebounds, blocked shots, points scored, and tell me he&#039;s a decent center.  Too bad they don&#039;t keep stats for what he really excels at - bad passes, moving picks and the inability to go up for a dunk before putting the ball on the floor where it can be stolen.  Why this man continues to be praised for his abilities is totally beyond me.]]></description>
