		<description><![CDATA[MPC,

Bolden wanted to get paid and you&#039;re correct about him having one year left on his contract. The best part about the Bolden story, he fired Drew Rosenhaus. The Cards couldn&#039;t pay Bolden and Larry Fitzgerald.

REPLY - MPC - He&#039;s taking up fly fishing waiting for a spiral to make its way to him]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Brady bitching at the receivers has increased 100% since his missed season.  Just saying...

The Red Sox are despicable.  The confidence men running that operation are snakes.  The funny thing is that the con is right in front of everyone&#039;s faces, blasted on their cable channel, advertising and hawking goods despite crying poor in free agency.  The Sox have $$$ every year and their lack of spending this offseason is glaring and abhorrent.

Mick Cronin certainly talked tough, but see Pat Forde&#039;s article on the embarassing lack of gumption in the suspensions.  Yancy Gates should not be allowed to play again this season, period.

REPLY - MPC - I agree on U of Cincy - no way do all those players come back]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wonder if Brady&#039;s finger pointing gas an effect on the confidence of receivers like Ocho and Taylor Price.  I also question whether challenging the coach in public is appropriate leadership.  It seems like the Pats were more succesful back when Brady was more of a &quot;system&quot; QB, showing a lot less ego.

REPLY - MPC - Brady is still the best QB ever but you might not get the best out of your WR if you are constantly yelling and showing them up as you noted]]></description>

Boldin went to Baltimore via trade.

REPLY - MPC - If I remember right - Bolden forced the situation and was actually picking where he wanted to go with the permission of the Cardinals prior to the trade with a year left on contract.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Everybody in the stadium except the lineman who jumped offside for Army knew they were trying to draw them offside, but the Navy coach&#039;s jumping up and down like a kid when it happened was disappointing. 

It&#039;s not good that Navy&#039;s won 10 in a row--at least it was a quality game.

REPLY - MPC - A coach celebrating a penalty like he just got a Talking Elmo for Christmas was immature at best and embarrassing for the Naval Academy at worst. I agree 49% of me was rooting for Army]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[UGLY in Cincy the other day! 

RGIII excellent individual. Third guy to win the Heisman born outside the states. 

Brady didn&#039;t speak with McDaniels during the season for a stretch. 

Classic confrontation between coach and quarterback on the sidelines. Giants at Colts (Monday Night football) Simms and Parcells going at it. 

Of course, Sunday Night football game between the Jets and Oilers in the Astrodome--Buddy Ryan and Kevin Gilbride, another classic on the sideline. 

Tebow and Flutie, all they do is win!

REPLY - MPC - Good note on RG3, Brady is great hope doesn&#039;t go too far Diva to the point we get a book 20 years from now like DiMaggio got]]></description>
