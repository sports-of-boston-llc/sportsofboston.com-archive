		<description><![CDATA[MC - hope you made some holiday spending cash with the stellar CFB picks!  Save for VT, you pretty much nailed the weekend (So Miss outright paid almost 4:1!)

REPLY - MPC - I&#039;m usually not a good picker but felt good after wathing Southern Miss a couple of times / And I know this after the fact but I wanted to change the VT - Clemson pick because it was too obvious to go against Clemson because of their bad roll. I went with the crowd on that]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Glass House: I do watch the games.  I said I was concerned about the depth (emphasis on depth) of the B&#039;s defense, meaning how will the defense fare when the inevitable injuries cause the Top-6 to miss significant time.  When those injuries occur, Kampfer &#038; Bartkowski would be expected to step in.

I&#039;m also aware that Kampfer &#038; Caron were sent down to Providence yesterday, but this is only because they have not played in any games lately, &#038; this will allow the to not get rusty.  They&#039;ll be back next week.  If you don&#039;t believe me, check out this link:

		<description><![CDATA[Bob T, do you even watch the games, The Bruins have one the best defenses in the NHL. Barkowski has only played in three games this year the last one was over a month and a half ago. Kamfer was injured during the end of preseason and is now playing in Providence.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[* It&#039;s all about winning the World Series, &#038; Francona won two of those.  However, it&#039;s odd to see that he only won one division title (2007) in his 8-years here.  It feels like it should have been more.
* Globally, all snakes cringe when they are compared to Larry Lucchino.
* The B&#039;s were great in November.  Not to jinx it because I know it will end anyway, but they have been incredibly healthy through the first 23-games.  I&#039;m especially concerned about their depth on defense. Kampfer regressed as last year went on &#038; has been shakey in limited play this year.  Hopefully, he might improve as he plays more. In the 3-games he played this year, their 8th defenseman, Bartkowski, looked the same as he did last year when he had the puck on his stick: scared to death. 
* He has played much better in recent games, but Benoit Pouliot is a disappointment waiting to happen.  It&#039;s going to be Caron&#039;s turn at some point.

REPLY - MPC - I couldn&#039;t believe looking at stats last night how many players have played in every game / Pouliot is showing up at times though - ie shootout / Yes on Lucchino]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Baylor should crush Texas. 

&quot;Big Game&quot; Bob (Stoops) will lose by double digits, agree!

If Houston loses (doubtful) they will lose more than a football game, they will lose millions of dollars. 

I say Georgia hangs around but will lose by 10-14. 

Why the hate on Sammy Watkins? Very exciting player. Clemson choking down the stretch, no surprise!

Classy move by Bobby V.--asking Lowell if it is ok to wear #25. Wearing it for the late great Tony C.---Valentine&#039;s one time teammate. I wonder what Jack Clark and Adam Hydzu think about it? lol.....

REPLY - MPC - Late getting back - I&#039;m a Sammy Watkins fans but that VT defense is always adding a little extra - but obviously wrong with my pick]]></description>
