		<description><![CDATA[Hobey Baker story only rivaled by Moe Berg (the catcher was a spy). Both major college hockey awards (men&#039;s and women&#039;s) named for Princeton grads. 

UCLA did the right thing and didn&#039;t let Rick &quot;Lotto&quot; Neuheisel coach in their bowl.

In the &quot;I hope a nuclear bomb hits the stadium&quot; game, Coach &quot;Refuse to Lose&quot; TM Cal&#039;s student-athletes beat Rick &quot;I apologize for that one indiscretion six years ago&quot; Pitino&#039;s frauds. If anybody needs proof of what&#039;s wrong (or right) with America, it&#039;s that these two shysters are multi-millionaires.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[New Subjects:  
Ryan Kalish – I’m not a doctor or any kind of medical professional, but how many “questionable” diagnoses did Dr. Gill &#038; medical staff come up with (Ellsbury, Buckholtz, et. al.)?  Kalish hurt his shoulder in April, &#038; Dr. Gill said that rest &#038; rehab would take care of it.  Instead, Kalish hurt his neck (requiring surgery in September) due to the un-healed shoulder injury, played only 24-games, &#038; ended up getting surgery for the torn labrum in his shoulder in November.  Now, Kalish won’t be ready when the 2012 season begins.

World Juniors: 
It’s an obvious statement, but Dougie Hamilton is a very impressive skater for a defenseman who is only 18-years old &#038; 6’-5”.  I can’t wait to see what kind of player he’ll be like after his frame fills out.

It’s very disappointing that the Canadian crowds in Edmonton root so much against Team USA when the US is playing any non-Canadian team.  I’d like to think that it’s a strictly hockey rivalry thing, but I think it has more to do with the average Canadian disliking the USA and Americans more than they used to.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If Urban is committed, great hire by Ohio State. He&#039;ll own that conference! 

How about coaches under Les Miles. Pellini doing well in Lincoln and Jimbo with FSU. 

When does Kirby Smart get a chance as a head coach? Excellent job at Bama as D. Coor.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[-But it was nice to see Spike Lee dressed like a 10 year old...again. Grow up clown.
- I don&#039;t think Celts make playoffs either. When Ainge whiffed on David West the season went with it.  It&#039;s too bad, as his other, smaller moves were solid.
-Did Garnett ever have a low post move?  How does a guy that big, that athletic, with that touch, not have a low post move? MAkes me want to strangle Bill Walker.
-La. Tech players, nice...

REPLY - MPC - Invite La Tech players to ESPY&#039;s / shocked he never developed a drop step with Kevin McHale at practice every day / Remember when Spike Lee was a player in the industry - the value of residuals and royalties I guess]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You forgot about &quot;the supermarket overpass&quot;!

Wow, I guess Terry Sawchuck led a troubled life.

C&#039;s will make playoffs.  43 wins usually gets you in, doesn&#039;t it?

REPLY - MPC - Celts with 66 games will have to win 35 which means they have to win 35 of next 63 / That turnpike ride, route 3 South Shore and 495 I couldn&#039;t do]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[MPC,

How does Ohio State win the Big 10 next year? They are not even eligible for the Conference Championship game next year.

Look out for FSU in 2012, Jimbo can recruit.

REPLY - MPC - Good call I thought it was only a bowl ban you&#039;re right - he has a playmaker QB coming back / FSU good players but I&#039;m not sure about him as a coach]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Celtics will make the playoffs, but will not get past the 1st rd. Way too many jumpshots for the green. Where&#039;s Garnett? Jermaine O&#039;Neal should be put out to pasture.  

Boise State should be playing in the Sugar Bowl against Michigan. How did Va. Tech get there? 

Remember, when &quot;good&quot; teams played in the top bowl games? I&#039;m getting old. 

Florida and Ohio State shouldn&#039;t even sniff a bowl game in January. They travel well and that is the only reason why. They should call it &quot;The Urban Myer Bowl.&quot; No bowl game for Ohio State next year. 

USC with Barkley against an SEC team for all the marbles next year.

REPLY - MPC - USC has one of the best coaches in football - Monte Kiffin / Ohio State wins the Big 10]]></description>
