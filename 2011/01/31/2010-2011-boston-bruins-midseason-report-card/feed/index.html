		<description><![CDATA[Are you suggesting that Bergeron wasn&#039;t &quot;back in form&quot; during the 2010 campaign? He had 52 points in the regular season, which was pretty low for him based on previous years, but I definitely feel like by the end of the year he had regained his form. His playoff run was the Bergeron we were familiar with at least (11 points in 14 games against some tough competition there).

Other than that, most of this is pretty good. Although I&#039;d probably squeak Marchand up to an A- based on really exceeding expecations and bringing a lot of excitement with him. Plus those short handed goals really help out.]]></description>
