		<description><![CDATA[I have been trying to Reach out to Ray Allen, I have written several letters, but I don&#039;t know if they are going to the correct place. My daughter Hannah was diagnosed at age 10 in 2008, I live in Zanesville Ohio. I have been hosting a Family Fun Day to raise money, support and awareness of Juvenile Diabetes for the past several years and this year we raised 11,000. I was wondering if Mr. Allen could send us something autographed for our live auction. Sports items bring in so much at our benefits and he is such a big starr, who is aware of what we all deal with. Could you tell me where to submit a letter to him? Thank you and god bless for all your doing, continue the fight...Jennifer West]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is wonderful.  Its amazing how being creative can become a voice for those who are overcoming an illness.  Thanks guys.  My son was diagnosed with Juvenile Diabetes Type 1 at the age of 2 with a glucose level of 1400.  He is now 4 and it has been a difficult road.  Everything change in a matter of seconds once a child is diagnosed and it takes the involvement of the entire family to assist with making things more manageable.  Everyone needs to get involve.  When we hear about diseases we never think it will affect a love one until it actually happen.  Being diagnosed with diabetes its a call for a healthy lifestyle, stress free, excerising, and paying attention to the physician care.]]></description>
