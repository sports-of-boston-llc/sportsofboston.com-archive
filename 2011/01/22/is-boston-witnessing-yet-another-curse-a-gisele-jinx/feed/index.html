		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been saying for years that Gisele is the Yoko Ono and Jessica Simpson of the Patriots.  From Brady limping in a cast to bring her flowers at her NY apartment just before Super Bowl XLII to the long hair, to seeing the play Lombardi when he should have been watching the Colts-Jets Brady is P-Whipped and he needs to grow a set.  He and the Pats can say whatever they want, but she has clearly been a distraction for Tom.  He is not the same player in the big games and doesn&#039;e seem to have the youthful energy that he used to have in those games. As much as it pains me to say this, since he met Gisele he has gone Hollywood. She&#039;s a me person who, being from Brazil, probably doesn&#039;t have much interest in football.  She wants Tom&#039;s focus to be on her and not football.  Tom, for the sake of the fans, and more importantly yourself, cut your hair, grow a set and return your focus to football during the season.  Redeem your fading glory and respect before it&#039;s too late.  If not, what&#039;s next?  Watching you at the Super Bowl sitting in the owners box with Gisele feeding you popcorn?  At that point I make my sons burn their jerseys and photos of you so that they can remember you the way you were.]]></description>
