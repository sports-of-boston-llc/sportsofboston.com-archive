		<description><![CDATA[What year is this blog actually posted? Looks a lot like the one posted about LAST year. If this IS posted for THIS year, why overlook the PITTSBURGH PIRATES? I say this not just as a fan of this GREAT team, but a fan of the sport. Do NOT count them out, even if everyone else says to do so. I have been a fan since 1975, and I have seen the BEST as well as the WORST from this team (particularly after last year), and KNEW they would turn things around just by the lineup in both players and coaches. This team has EARNED the respect it has fought hard for this season, and no matter what, I will stand behind the Pirates 110 PERCENT!]]></description>
