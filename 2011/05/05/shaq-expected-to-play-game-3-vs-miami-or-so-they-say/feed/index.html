		<description><![CDATA[Shaq is becoming bigfoot; I keep hearing about sightings but I never see him myself.  

Shaq can help the team, even if all he does is clog the middle and force Miami into jumpshots; hopefully Z does not draw him 15 feet away from the basket all night. 

The Celts still have a chance to win the series; they have the next two games at home and Miami is fully capable of 35% shooting night or a meltdown.  I hope this series goes to game 7; it will feel like the NBA Finals.
