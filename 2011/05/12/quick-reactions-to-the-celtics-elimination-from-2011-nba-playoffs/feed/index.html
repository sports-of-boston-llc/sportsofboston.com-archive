		<description><![CDATA[Congratulations to Matt for a spot on analysis.  Thank goodness somebody finally said that having Perkins out there wouldn&#039;t have made any difference.  His dismal numbers with Oklahoma are a testament to how overrated he is, and Wade and James would have had him fouling so much that he wouldn&#039;t have been effective.  Miami is just a better team than Boston at this point, and so is Chicago.  

Rondo&#039;s scoring liabilites are a shame, considering the kind of heart he showed, and the Celts definitely need a reliable center and/or someone as a go to guy for scoring purposes.

Glen Davis had a horrible playoff season, and I wouldn&#039;t be surprised to see him traded.  The bench - except for West - was just awful.  If the Celts go into next year with the same basic bunch, the results will just be the same.  Good luck in the off season - there are bound to be some good free agents available.]]></description>
