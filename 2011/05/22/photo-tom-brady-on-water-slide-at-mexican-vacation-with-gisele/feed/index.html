		<description><![CDATA[I kid, all in good fun, he has it all - Super Bowls, Super Model, Super...uh..life. So really envy plays a significant role over anything else in terms of criticism.

But, as Brian said and we&#039;ve discussed, I miss the Brady with the crew cut, leading his team down the field. TMZ Tom is tough to digest at times. And yes, Gisele looks fannnnnn-tastic here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like how &quot;Tom Brady Hair&quot; has developed it&#039;s own tag here at SOB...

Mr. Brady, what you&#039;ve done is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever seen. At no point in your actions, were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having believed in you. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.]]></description>
