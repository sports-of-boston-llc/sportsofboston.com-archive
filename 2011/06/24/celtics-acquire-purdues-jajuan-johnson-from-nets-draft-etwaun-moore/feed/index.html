		<description><![CDATA[Like Johnson&#039;s game, though he cost me money two years ago against Duke in the tourney. (always fun to root against the Blue Devils). Overall love the pick - I&#039;ve seen enough of Johnson to know he can be a rotational player. His comp is a poor man&#039;s Marcus Camby.  

Moore seemed pensive at times in college, which he&#039;ll ill-afford being able to do at the NBA level

For those clamoring for Brooks -- he reminded me of Troy Bell to much (a dominating on the ball player)]]></description>
