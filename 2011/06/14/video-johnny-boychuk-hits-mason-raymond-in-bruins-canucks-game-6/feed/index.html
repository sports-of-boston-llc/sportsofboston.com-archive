		<description><![CDATA[Boychuk should have been penalized and suspended. He could have broken his stride to avoid ramming Raymond into the boards. This is what players must do when they see the number on the back of the jersey to avoid Boarding. Where&#039;s the difference?

This is the same case of blaming the victim as in the case of Rome. In the Rome case, the injury was taken into consideration. This injury was worse and there was not even a penalty. 

It was not a clean hit.

Isn&#039;t it strange that in only a few months the Bruins have broken two men&#039;s backs? Coincidence? Coach&#039;s responsibility?]]></description>
