		<description><![CDATA[Of course the C`s should get NENE he will take 7million a year because he wants to win a championship. KG 
&#038; NENE in the starting lineup that will kill Miami and Chicago because you have more defense on the team that wins Championship. Dwight Howard &#038; B.Bass is going to Chicago for Boozer,Noah,Asik, and Lucas. So forget about him.Boston should sign Delonte,Big Baby,D`Andre Jordan, and Grant Hill for the 2nd screen because the starting lineup will need rest. The C`s should trade Rondo,J.O`Neal, and A.Bradley to OKC for Westbrook a real scorer who can kill Miami in the 4th Quarter.The new starting lineup for the C`s Westbrook#4,Allen#20,Pierce#34,Garnett#5, and NENE#30. This team will win 3straight titles if this happen.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice read. However...having followed the Nuggets for 3 decades I can tell you that Nene, while talented and productive, frustrates Nuggets fans to no end and would do that even more to the hardcore Celtics&#039; fans.

Nene is a weak rebounder, is not much of a shot-blocking presence and will not assert himself on offense. George Karl has just learned to accept that last issue.

Nene is upset playing center. He wants to be a PF. In his past, he is a better rebounder at PF but a lesser scorer at that position.

I think Nene would love to play in Miami but Denver&#039;s not going to help make that happen and the Heat, well, they don&#039;t have the kind of cheese Nene is going to want.

Guessing, after a lot of posturing, Nene gets (over)paid to stay in Denver.

By the way, congratulations Celtics, you got the best Kansas Jayhawk in that draft years ago where the Nuggets thought they had to have Raef Lafrentz instead of Paul Pierce.]]></description>
