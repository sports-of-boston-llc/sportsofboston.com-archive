		<description><![CDATA[Is it possible for you to write an article based on facts without resorting to name calling?  &quot;Little children and dirty hitters&quot;? Come on...perhaps you conveniently forgot about Chara&#039;s &quot;clean&quot; hit on Max...the fact he didn&#039;t get suspended by an &quot;unbias&quot; NHL doesn&#039;t mean it was clean.  And you think the opinions of Roenick, Whitney and Bolland amount to a concensus?  As for Mr. McIntyre, he&#039;s an eastern transplant and has gotten over the fact that his home team has won anything since Gretzky/Messier area.  And by the way, hope you enjoyed the game today LOL!]]></description>
