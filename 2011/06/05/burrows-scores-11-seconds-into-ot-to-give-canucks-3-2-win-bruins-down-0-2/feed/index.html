		<description><![CDATA[Last time i checked,  dogs bite.  filthy animals bite.  The fact that the league suspends players in the regular season for biting and has a rule written to automatically suspend someone and fail to do it in the Cup is mindblowing.  Burrows  chomped on Bergerons finger.  Clear as crystal.  If Milan Lucic munched on Danial or Henrik Sedins finger, im sure Canuck fans would be like their fellow countryman and go and im positive it would have resulted in a suspension.  Say what you want, but for a province that was bitching and complaining about how Colin Cambell&#039;s Son played on the Bruins before the series even started...  

Oh, and the hit on Nathon Horton is going to be the reason why the Bruins will win the cup.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can you please explain what all the fuss is about &quot;the bite&quot;? The way some Bruins media &#038; fans go on about it they make it sound like Patrice had the damn thing severed.

Really people, is this a series changing, momentum swinging moment?

Give it a rest already and play the damn game!]]></description>
