		<description><![CDATA[This was a momentum hit, and Horton was too busy watching his pass.  Rome&#039;s contact was shoulder to upper chest, not head.  Horton&#039;s head gave the ice a pretty good smack.  If Chara got nothing for his hit on Pacioretty, there should be no suspension here either.  Arguably, Chara&#039;s hit was also a momentum play.]]></description>
