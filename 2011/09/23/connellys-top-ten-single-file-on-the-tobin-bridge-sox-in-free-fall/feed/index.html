-Not done on the Sox yet, team has been Cybil all year long, would not surprise me to see them go on a strong winning streak following the disappointment, they are streaky and Cybil-esque

REPLY - MPC - Yes on Pitino - I hope the Sox go on a streak if not I hope they don&#039;t make it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Curtis Martin left for the betterment of his career? Seriously? Did you not read between the lines at the end of his career with the Jets? He hung on one last year and even tried to squeeze out one more, which didn&#039;t work, because he was so distraught with the realization that his career was going to end with no SB ring! It was very evident by his remarks at the time.

Martin knows he most likely would have had 3 rings had he stayed with the Pats and hadn&#039;t allowed himself to be pulled along by his nose ring by Parcells. Do I feel sorry for him? Not in the least. No one put a gun to his head when he signed the Jets offer sheet that included the poison pill preventing the Pats to match the offer. No doubt he&#039;d trade the extra million after taxes he might have made with the Jets for those 3 SB rings. I doubt he sends a Christmas card to Parcells each year.

BTW, let&#039;s not forget this interesting fact: Parcells never won ONE SINGLE playoff game without Belichick at his side. I bet that fact won&#039;t be on his NFL HOF plaque!

REPLY - MPC - Martin thrived in both places and would have thrived in both places - Belichick nod over Parcells but both great. Martin might have struggled in Carroll&#039;s offense]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[-Jon Lester is a good #3 pitcher. Time for everyone to stop calling him an ace.  

-Poker on TV is awful. I thought that wannabe crowd had moved on to MMA and shows about building motorcycles &#038; monster trucks anyway?    

-Sox season has come down to &quot;let&#039;s watch Ellsbury bat&quot; for me.  

-Nice that Sox have strategically positioned themselves for the indignity of a sweep in the Bronx as the deciding factor in the wild card race.  

-Bay, I am somewhere in between your take and Holt&#039;s.  True, he was awful on breaking balls but would rather have him than Crawford.  

-Pats 34 Bills 24

REPLY - MPC - I think the Patriots over is going to be like a Nebraska - Iowa State game in the 1980&#039;s / Ellsbury amazing season - hhmmmmm / Lester is 1A - he has had no command this year though]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great to the list working again!!
Sheesh, you &#038; Mazz: Disagree w/ Bay wholeheartedly; his first year here was the zenith of his career and I&#039;ll always maintain that if the guy could hit a breaking ball the Sox would&#039;ve beat TB in the playoffs.  Ballparks are ballparks, but that does not alone account for Bay&#039;s downfall... he was gonna slide if he was here or there.  Not saying Crawford right now is doing well, but I&#039;ll take a 3 yr comparative of him vs Bay anytime.
Also disagree on Fisk, who, for most of his Other Sox career was on a sub 500 team that saw players come &#038; go and never did too much.  Getting back to the ballpark idea, what influence it has, Fenway was perfect for him.

REPLY - MPC - It might have been bad luck but Bay leaving him brought him to the Bermuda Triangle / Fisk would have been good here if he stayed but certainly thrived in Chicago]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t forget about Joe Johnson,Rick Fox, Chauncey Billups, and David Wesley. Hawks grossly overpaid Johnson last summer but has had a solid career since leaving the Celtics. Lit them up in the playoffs at Phillips Arena. Fox and Billups went on to win NBA titles. Billups played big minutes on those Detroit teams. Fox was a nice piece to the puzzle. 

Jeff Suppan better without Fenway Park. Coco Crisp playing better away from Boston. Never filled Damon&#039;s shoes. Another miss by Theo and the baseball ops. (oops) dept. 

You hate watching poker on TV---I hate watching the Red Sox on TV

REPLY - MPC - Good add ins on those who left for the better/ Red Sox are useless watching live DVR and push fast forward
