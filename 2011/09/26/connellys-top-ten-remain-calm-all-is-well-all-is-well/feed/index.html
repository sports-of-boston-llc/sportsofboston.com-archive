		<description><![CDATA[*I know you&#039;re expecting me to un-load on Brady for the 4-interceptions, but I don&#039;t expect that to happen again.  On the other hand, the defense is absolutely brutal. To this point, there has been zero improvement since last year.  I know the defensive backfield is bad, but it would much better if there was anything resembling a pass rush. Nothing. Thank God we can count on Albert Haynesworth to come back &#038; contribute (sarcasm).  Will that end up being like the &quot;Shaq Watch&quot; in the playoffs? Hopefully, the defense will somehow improve as the season continues, but right now, the D-outlook is bleak. It puts a ton of pressure on Brady &#038; the offense to score TD&#039;s, almost everytime they have the ball.
* I&#039;ve heard a few comments about Brady&#039;s non-tackle attempt on the Florence interception TD. I thought the pathetic non-attempt against Miami was much more blatant.
* I always supported Theo in his battles against Lucchino, who I think is a self-serving snake.  However, I think Theo was &quot;Lucchino-like&quot; in his recent actions.  The Red Sox &quot;Minister of Propaganda&quot;,Peter Gammons, told Dan Patrick last Thursday that Red Sox management was un-happy with many of Franconna&#039;s recent moves.  It seems pretty obvious that Theo was the source of this, and Gammons would never say that without being given the greenlight.  Theo &#038; Gammons are happily involved in a long-term &quot;bromance&quot;, &#038; there is no way that Theo didn&#039;t approve in advance of this information being revealed by Gammons. Franconna is certainly open to criticism this year, but I see no possible reason why Theo would want this story out there, right before the huge series with the Yankees.  It just provided a distraction to a team  that has been looking for excuses all year.  Plus, Franconna seems like he has been pretty loyal to Theo, and has not publicly complained about the junk Theo provided for pitching (Lackey, Wakefield, Wayland, etc.).  I think it was a destructive and snake-like play by Theo in order to point the finger somewhere.

REPLY - MPC - Good comparison on Shaq - I agree that info was fed, defense is trouble]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[brady will be 5th all time after this year in tds. 

Ridley is nice but they spent 6 picks in the last draft on offensive players, traded 2 more to future drafts when brady is 34 and their defense has for 4 years been unable to do anything. add in the deal of seymour out and they&#039;re wasting the end of an alltime career to get backup rbs. 

10 years ago this red sox team would be a forever story. now just an afterthought.

Brady and Fitzpatrick both 6th round or later qbs-shows how important late round picks are. 

Moneyball worth the money to see. 

rays are the 2000&#039;s twins and 90s expos. Friedman should go to chicago. 

I expect the colts-pats game to be 48-3. networks are screwed with 6 primetime colts games left this year.

wilson could make a case-big 10 is down this year, most voters don&#039;t see stanford games and sec teams usually eat each other up.

REPLY - MPC - As always your stuff is great, great round 6 point, on target on Red Sox - bummer but not venom]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bledsoe = McPuke?

How do you figure that one?
McNab a mobile QB while Bledsoe was Pocket Passer.
That would be kinda like Randall Cunningham = Steve Grogan

And last I heard Bledsoe did not puke in the huddle during the Super Bowl on the most important drive of his career...

I was glad to here on a sports radio program this weekend them giving Bledsoe his due and naming him (along with Kraft and Parcells ) as saving this franchise!!! 
A lot of the fair weather fans around here forget about the state of this franchise prior to Bledsoes arrival (probably because of Bradys success), but think back to prior to Bledsoe and the many years we had to deal with the Hugh Millen type QB......

REPLY - MPC - I am a Bledsoe fan and do truly appreciate what he did here (the pin in the finger game was amazing) but him and McNabb just not good enough to be in the Hall of Fam]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In my book Brady will always have a lifetime free pass. However, him not attempting to prevent the TD is just like not running out a ground ball. It looks really bad and I wonder what his teammates think...

REPLY - MPC - I agree - it wouldn&#039;t have made a difference most likely but its looked bad no doubt]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting stat that I saw today.  Baylor quarterback has 15 touchdown passes to 12 `incompletions` this year.  Griffin is impressive.

I hate the conference realignment crap.  College football will be very different.  Big 12 and Big East commissioners were the ones against the plus one format proposed by the ACC and the SEC a few years ago.  I hope they regret it now since their leagues are imploding.

MPC - REPLY - Check out the SI article on Griffin III - a guy you want to root for like Tebow, McCoy and Bradford

		<description><![CDATA[Thought Brady lost focus once Pats had that 21-0 lead against an opponent he&#039;d beaten 15 times in a row. Bills didn&#039;t get the memo. 
McCourty did defend a couple passes, tough to do when opposing QB has time for a cup of tea in the pocket.
Brady had no chance at that tackle, and if he tried someone would have creamed him: smart play. 
Never mind Harang, glad Sox decided Bedard was healthier than Harden?

REPLY - MPC - Ya Bedard hasn&#039;t worked / McCourty I&#039;m shocked how much they&#039;re throwing his way]]></description>
