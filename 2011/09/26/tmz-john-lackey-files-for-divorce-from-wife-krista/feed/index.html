		<description><![CDATA[What a total and complete low life. Krista, his wife, was way too pretty and sweet to be with him to begin with. She obviously wasn&#039;t with him for his money (they have a pre-nump_ and she certainly wasn&#039;t with him for his looks, so she actually loved that monster. I hope she gets well and meets a REAL man and that this little boy continues to suck wind and get shamed out of baseball for good. Sorry, but this is ridiculous, he must have met another woman. He should concentrate on baseball.]]></description>
