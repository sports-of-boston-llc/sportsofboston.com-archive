		<description><![CDATA[Hi BD,
Thanks for the comment! You are absolutely right: I missed Peverley, who was listed as a center on the ESPN roster. I will fix the article to reflect this, and I agree: he makes a far better option as the 2nd line right winger than Thornton. But Thornton&#039;s experience should still be enough to graduate him to the third line, with Seguin and Kelly battling at center.
Keep on reading!

		<description><![CDATA[The writer of this article clearly does not follow the Bruins or even really have any idea what they have been up to since they won the cup.  Thornton on the 2nd Line? Also what happened to Peverly? Seriously at least try to look like you know the teams]]></description>
