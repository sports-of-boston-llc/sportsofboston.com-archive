		<description><![CDATA[Matt, you have missed the insights and meaning of the film entirely.  I hope no one is paying you for this column because they wasted their money if they did. Beane is a winner, he took a team that should not compete and made a team that was better than most, adding their name to the records book along the way.  He feels he is a loser because he didn&#039;t win the final game but that is his shortsightedness...and yours.  His legacy is that teams, such as Boston, took on his POV and made it work to a greater degree leaving a legacy which will not denied.  Sorry that you were unable to understand the meaningfulness of his efforts.]]></description>
