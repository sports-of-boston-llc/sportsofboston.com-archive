		<description><![CDATA[I wonder about the speed of the game. Since that can be tweaked, most reviews I&#039;ve read don&#039;t discuss this much. Did you run the game merely on default settings? Did you make any tweaks? If so, which ones?

Side note: For people who&#039;ve played Madden since its inception, the need to buy the game every year probably faded back in the 90&#039;s. I think each generation discovers this on their own. There is something great about being a relatively NEW player and getting your hands on the latest version of the game.

Thanks for sharing. BTW, which system did you use?]]></description>
