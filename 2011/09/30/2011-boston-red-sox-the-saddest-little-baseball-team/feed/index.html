		<description><![CDATA[Great insight, Mr. Segal.

To quote the immortal Reese Bobby, &quot;If you ain&#039;t first, your&#039;e last.&quot;  The Sux were not first.  I&#039;m not looking for a season of quality entertainment.  I am looking for more championship hats and bragging rights to those less fortunate to live in Boston.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a pathetic post.

The Red Sox had an up-and-down season.  They were often a joy to watch, and many players such as Ellsbury, Pedroia and Gonzalez made some amazing plays.  It was great seeing Big Papi regain his form during the middle of the season, and Youkilis performed well when healthy.  It was great seeing solid performances from new and up-and-coming players like Saltalamacchia and Lavarnway.

At the end of the day, they were let down by inconsistent pitching.  That can happen to any team.

If you want to be a pissy loser, go root for some other team.  If you want to root for the Red Sox, grow up and show some class.]]></description>
