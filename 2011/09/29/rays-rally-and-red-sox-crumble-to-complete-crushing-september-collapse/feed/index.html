		<description><![CDATA[First of all the fact of the matter is the Rays DID rally. They were down 7-0 in the eighth inning and came back to win. If a high school team was playing them then it&#039;d be a rally. That&#039;s what a rally is. 

Secondly, the game DID matter to the O&#039;s do you not remember Buck&#039;s comments about the Red Sox? Do you not think since they had nothing to play for THIS was their playoff game. They had a chance to ruin it for the moneybag Red Sox. The game mattered to them. 

It didn&#039;t matter one bit to the Yankees and if the Red Sox were in that same position Boston would slaughter Terry Francona if he even thought of keeping all the starters in through the whole game when they were up 7-0 in the eighth. 

The Red Sox choked. Period and the Rays were the beneficiary. They won. The Sox lost. That&#039;s the all of it. When you lose 20 games in a month this is what happens. The Yankees don&#039;t get any blame in this. The Rays deserve credit for never quitting on their season and the Red Sox deserve the criticism for doing the opposite.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am not a fan of the Rays, the Yankees, or the Red Sox, and I do not agree with Kevin Buck&#039;s claim that the Yankees laid down. They made the playoffs...they were resting their starters for a game that is to be played tomorrow. When they got benched they were ahead. Tampa MADE A REMARKABLE recovery they were only a strike away of not making the playoffs. Face IT the RED SOXS BOMBED and they only have to look in the mirror to see why they BOMBED. Any RED SOX fan that THINKS the Yankees tanked probably was too busy watching their team fall apart and were not watching the Rays and the Yankees. As a BASEBALL fan I saw a Yankee team that was TRYING to win the game.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I find it very strange that everyone is talking about how the Rays rallied against the Yankees. The starts were almost all pulled and the Rays were pitted against pretty much the Yankees triple A team. The Rays should have never been allowed to get back into the game and I find it a complete disgrace on the Yankees organization for playing it out the way they did last night. I am at no point blaming this for the collapse of the Sox. Just saying that when the season is on the line for one team you do not lay back and let them get back into it no matter who they are. The game didn&#039;t matter to the O&#039;s and they played hard until the end. The Yankee&#039;s should have played hard until the end also. What I witnessed last night was a disgrace by both the Red Sox and the Yankees]]></description>
