		<description><![CDATA[good article. However, how about this? If my memory serves me correct because (i am not a big east follower), wasnt it WVU and L-Ville who held the Big East Together after the last raid in the early 2000.  WVU under a new coach during that time, spark three 11 win season, winning four bowl games, including two against national brands such as OU and Georgia.  L-Ville also went on a run as well winning a BCS game.  I even recall, the WVU and the big east match up made thursday night football popular on ESPN. These actions bolded the Big East from the depts of mid america and allowed them to keep there BCS standing. I do consider WVU a brand that most known. I do think the Big East can ride the ship, and still remain apart of the big conference. USF, Cinny, L-Ville and WVU are the answer, with smart adds such as ECU, Central Fla, and Navy.  WVU again is in this position, with a new exciting coach, and saturday with the world watching.  Can lighting strike again...  I sure hope so.  That would be a story.]]></description>
