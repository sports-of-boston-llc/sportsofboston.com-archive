But at the end of the day, with all of Brady&#039;s plays, both good and bad, he gave the team roughly a 50-50 chance of winning.  That means his play was only a notch below the overall play of the Bills.  I would give the Bills a solid B, which means Brady would earn at least a C.  Not that a C is acceptable to me, but unless you have a special grading scale that only applies to Tom Brady, then his play certainly doesn&#039;t merit a D.]]></description>
