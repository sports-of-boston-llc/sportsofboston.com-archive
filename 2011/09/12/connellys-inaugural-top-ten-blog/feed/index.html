		<description><![CDATA[Welcome back!  The clock is ticking for your first complaint of the B&#039;s not spending up to the salary cap, &#038; the greed of Jacobs, etc., after winning the Cup.  Once Savard&#039;s salary is taken off the books for &#039;11-&#039;12 due to long-term injury, the B&#039;s will be $11.6M under the cap.  If Marchand is not signed before veterans report on the 15th, you will soon thereafter be unloading on the B&#039;s.  If Marchand is re-signed, you will wait for a sluggish streak for the B&#039;s, &#038; then complain they should have signed more free agents (even though it was a very weak class of UFAs).  I look forward to your Bruins criticisms.  Like Christmas, they always come. I, also, look forward to the replies that your knowledgeable Bruins fans will provide.

REPLY - MPC - Funny thing is that I was right about more things than the Bruins fans over the last five years but listen you got your Cup I&#039;m not going to ruin it for you to flash back to my hockey brilliance the previous years]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What do you mean you don&#039;t know what I am talking about....Just say that &quot;YOU WERE WRONG&quot;!! Just once and I will leave it alone!!

Just say you were wrong about:
1. The Bruins not being a contender.
2. The Bruins can&#039;t make it past the second round.
3. Ferrence.
4. Lucic
and so on.

Just a single &quot;I was wrong about the Bruins&quot; comment is all that is needed!!

&lt;strong&gt;REPLY&lt;/strong&gt; - MPC - What you&#039;re saying is that if I say that I was wrong about the Bruins in year 2011 then you&#039;ll never bother me - thats a deal that I can&#039;t pass on. I was wrong about the Bruins in 2011! (funny thing is that you never said I was right the previous years - hmmmm)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Welcome back, we&#039;ve missed you.  

-The Sox catchers performance, especially Saltalamacchia&#039;s ability to throw out runners has been a nice development. 

-JD Drew and Carl Crawford (who looks and plays scared) both laughing all the way to the bank.  Lackey is complaining all the way to the bank. 

-If Pats ran in a 2-point conversion up 27-7 would we be talking about running it up? &quot;Conversion Gate?&quot;

-Almost 115,000 at the Michigan game.  Unreal!

&lt;strong&gt;REPLY&lt;/strong&gt; - MPC - Good notes on Pats running in and Lackey complaining to the Bank thats $52mm between the three of them (Drew, Crawford, LAckey)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[BC loss was tough.  Interesting that there are only 4 major college football programs in the country that have not had an NCAA violation - BC is on of them.

Good call on the Scooby Doo bad guy.
Psyched your back.


&lt;strong&gt;REPLY&lt;/strong&gt; - MPC - BC has no violations or wins or offensive creativity / Scooby Doo bad guy must have been out on probation because he seemed to be guilty of multiple offenses]]></description>
