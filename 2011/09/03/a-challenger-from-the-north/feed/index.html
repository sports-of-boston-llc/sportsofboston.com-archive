per team.What national league in any country operates like that rather reversed
only two imports.The only advantage for Canadians is seeing their young players developing not some unheard of Americans
This whole league is joke.If you are going to war make sure of your battle plan here there is none.The legitimate team they have is Halifax

		<description><![CDATA[This is such a silly article.
Ontario (Toronto)has  a new ABA francise
the Revolution, which starts play in the fall which is is more of a threat.
This writer did no research 0.Why would
Canadians accept any team that did not give them American acceptance]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[looove the rebuttal.  Yes your math is correct if 22 teams are losing money and if the Raps are the 10th most valuable team then they are losing money.  

Are you also suggesting then that we should cut the rest of the teams outside of the top 10 then as well?  Detroit is close enough to Toronto, they can watch the NBL. Hey isn&#039;t the American credit rating bad?  I guess you guys are bleeding money too, let&#039;s cut the whole country while we&#039;re at it.

PS. Alberta is warmer then Alaska.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The idea behind the NBL is to expand interest in basketball around the country, because other than hotbeds in southern Ontario and BC and Halifax, interest is pretty low.  

However, without the Raptors in the NBA there would be a steep decline in the already small amount of interest that exists outside of basketball-playing markets.  It would counteract all the hard work Canada Basketball has done to promote the game on a grassroots level.

Without the Raptors in the NBA, there will be no NBL...simple as that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As many have mentioned this article is full of incorrect assertions and it is safe to say that more research could of been done.  Dan, you should really do your research before publishing your name to an article.  It could come back to bite you in the future.  All it takes is one silly article for people to not take what you write seriously.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The NBA and the NBL as it stands now are 2 very different things. The NBA is a $ billion enterprise showcasing the best b-ball players in the world. The NBL is a small league that will give a few guys on their way down a chance to play and make a few $, and give a few young guys the chance to showcase their skills and maybe hook up with bigger $ on a team in Europe, the middle east or Asia. The teams will play before maybe 2500 folks a night and if last year with the Millrats was any indication, be a great, affordable, fun night out.
The whole league will run on the money paid to a 7th or 8th man in the NBA so suggesting the NBL buy the Raptors is laughable.]]></description>
