		<description><![CDATA[Again, I&#039;m still waiting to hear if Brady should be excused for not even attempting to make a tackle on a 300-lb lineman? 
It&#039;s funny that you mention Joe Thornton.  You&#039;ve always ripped Thornton for having great regular seasons &#038; disappearing in the playoffs.  It appears that since the Super Bowl win over Philly, Brady has &quot;devolved&quot; into Joe Thornton. Excellent regular seasons followed by mediocre post seasons.  
You can never take away Brady&#039;s 3-rings, but the truth is that Brady has been a mediocre post-season performer since their last Super Bowl victory. Since the Pats beat Philly in 2005, Brady has lost post season games to teams with the following QB&#039;s: Jake Plummer, Peyton &#038; Eli Manning, Joe Flacco, &#038; Mark Sanchez. Other than Flacco, who just handed the ball off all game, Brady was outplayed by the opposing QB.  Other than Peyton, I don&#039;t think any of those other QBs are close to the same class as Montana. 
I hope Brady racks up great numbers in inthe regular season because the Patriots need him to.  However, the real test will come in the playoffs. It&#039;s time for Brady to show that he can still produce there. It&#039;s not February, 2005 anymore.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Brady had a great/historic night last night.  However, he had plenty of those last year in the regular season. I disagree with: &quot;He is the coolest cat to ever play QB – amazing to watch him manipulate whenever a team shows blitz too early&quot;. In Brady&#039;s last 3-post season games vs. the Giants, Ravens, &#038; Jets, all showed the blitz liberally, &#038; Brady did not appear to be &quot;the coolest cat&quot;, nor did he produce like one.
Also, I don&#039;t blame him for last night&#039;s interception, but would it be sacrilegious to ask Brady to at least try to run down a 300-lb defensive lineman?  Odrick was only 5-yards in front of Brady with 45-yards to go.  Brady took 2-steps &#038; stopped. I would expect more hustle from a team captain, but, again, I&#039;m sure questioning Brady&#039;s effort is considered blasphemy.

&lt;strong&gt;REPLY&lt;/strong&gt; - MPC - Joe Thornton would have smiled and given the guy a high five on his way back / Name someone cooler than Brady at QB - Montana great with Rice, Craig, Taylor, Rathman, Brent Jones --- oh I forgot you were in the group that said Bledsoe was better......]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[- MPC, what is your over/under on Pats TEs and TDs this year?  We are all giving you another crack at this after last year&#039;s low ball predictoin! 

-Manny graduates from assaulting 64 y.o. year old men to women. Disgraceful.  

-Is that was Jaworski said?  I only caught his apology.  Funny.  

-Um, yes, I am a little worried about our D&#039;s ability to graduate from Chad Henne to Philip Rivers.

&lt;strong&gt;REPLY&lt;/strong&gt; - MPC - Thats why I don&#039;t live in Vegas (although Hernandez really isn&#039;t a tight end) but lets say 12 on TD&#039;s / Manny once a punk always a punk / I think defense is ready for December cold]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You nailed the &quot;Bit Outside&quot;.  When will the rest of the country see Wade for the the punk that he is?

Was the Pat&#039;s clock/play management in the last three minutes questionable and perhaps too arrogant?

REPLY - MPC - Concerned with getting Brady more yards and not securing the game no doubt]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Concerned with the secondary giving up 400+ yards to a 3rd tier QB...How many yards will they give up to a top tier QB.

REPLY - MPC - Miami does have weapons but I agree - the secondary will only be as good as their pass rush and the push from the line.]]></description>
