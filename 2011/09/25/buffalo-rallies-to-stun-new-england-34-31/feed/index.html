		<description><![CDATA[I agree the officiating was disgraceful, but I can&#039;t blame that for the loss.  We had plenty of opportunities on both offense and defense and didn&#039;t complete the game.  I also disagree with you that Brady should have tried to make a tackle after throwing that interception.  That&#039;s the last thing I want him to do.  He needs to stay out of the fray and save himself for the next series.  I do agree with you though that I&#039;m ready to get rid of 85 and find a player who can make a difference.  And I wish we had a better pass defense.  That loss could have easily gone the other way.  While I&#039;m not happy about it, its not hard to figure out what needs to be done to get the team firing on all cylinders.]]></description>
