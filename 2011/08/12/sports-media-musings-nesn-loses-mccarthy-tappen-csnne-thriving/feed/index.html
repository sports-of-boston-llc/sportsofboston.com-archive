		<description><![CDATA[Not sure where in Fl you are.Here in Orlando we have Brighthouse for cable and last year they added NESN to their lineup. I was sooo excited because I had been kicking out around $150 a year for the NHL package just to watch the Bruins. But alas when the Bruins came on down here we saw Dennis &#038; Callahan. They did rebroadcast the game at midnight so I DVR&#039;d all the programs. I don&#039;t watch the Sox that much so not sure if they do the same thing. It&#039;s something to do with Fl being out of market as to why they don&#039;t broadcast the games live. Check to see if the games are rebroadcasted later in the evening.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry to see Kathryn leave.  Just a question...we subscribe to nesn when we are in Florida in the winter and spring.  Why are we not able to watch the Red Sox???  This year I watched opening day and saw Tom Carroll&#039;s intro and he turned it over to the game.  Instead of seeing opening day, we saw a rehash of Dennis &#038; Callahan.  What a disappointment!  Is that going to happen in 2012?  If so, we will not subscribe to nesn down in FL.  Please let me know.  Thank you.]]></description>
