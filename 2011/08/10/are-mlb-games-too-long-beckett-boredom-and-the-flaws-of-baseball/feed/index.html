		<description><![CDATA[There has to be a clock both behind the batter so the pitcher can see and on the outfield score board so the hitter/home plate ump can see it. Once the clock gets down, the crowd gets into it.

Also, there IS a rule about pitcher&#039;s time between pitches. The MLB rule book states that the pitcher has 12 seconds to deliver a pitch once he receives the ball. If he doesn&#039;t, the umpire can say &quot;ball&quot; and there will be a ball added to the count]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like your ideas. Here are a few more. 
Why do the players have to warm up between innings? What other sport allows that? When the inning is over the next one should start without warming up..again.
If they are worried about TV commercials, schedule them like most other sports.
Why do relief pitchers have to warm up before they officially start pitching? What were they doing in the bullpen?
Once in, batters should not be allowed to leave the batters box.
Once a pitcher touches the rubber he shouldn&#039;t be allowed to step off until he pitches.]]></description>
