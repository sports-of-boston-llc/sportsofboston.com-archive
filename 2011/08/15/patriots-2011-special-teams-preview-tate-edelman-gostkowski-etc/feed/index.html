		<description><![CDATA[I believe you missed out on an amazing special teams player this year. 4 year starting long snapper Alex Shackleton, who the Spartas are having a really hard time replacing, would be an amazing asset to any team. He&#039;s absolutely perfect every time. Fake field goal play against Notre  Dame..the best play in Spartan history to this day. Takes a hell of a player with calmness and ease with confidence to pull that off. Thank you for your time, please consider Alex Shackleton. I believe in him, and when you see his talent, so will you.]]></description>
