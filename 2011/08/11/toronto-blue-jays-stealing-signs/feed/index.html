		<description><![CDATA[The MLB and the reporters at ESPN who have a tabloid-esque love for rumors and lack of regard for actual evidence should probably take the advice of Blue Jays GM Alex Anthopolous and go look at some tape... look at lots of tape.  Find this supposed man in white and lets see it.  Without that type of proof, ESPN has once again proven that writing stories that approximate following their gut, or listenining to some unnamed sources who got their butts beat by the Jays, is as close to actual journalism as they&#039;re willing to get.

Jose Bautista in particular has faced far too many questioners since he found his power stroke.  The accusations of drug use were ridiculous.  For one thing, MLB has incorporated a strong testing policy.  Bautista goes through all the same tests as ARod or Manny, so why would anyone with a brain continue to insist he must be taking PEDs?  It doesn&#039;t make sense.  

Of course everyone knows the steroid rumors are based on nothing and so now they are seeking to find another way to discredit Bautista.  

Well enough is enough.  Reporters need to start doing actual journalism based on facts and stay away from this rumor-fueled factless kind of garbage.

Thank you.]]></description>
