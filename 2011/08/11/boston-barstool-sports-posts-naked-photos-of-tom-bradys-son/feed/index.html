Max - It&#039;s common practice to link to what we&#039;re referring to...so it gives what we&#039;re saying some context. And yes, we may have picked up some extra hits for covering this - but this was a huge story when it happened. We wouldn&#039;t be doing our job if we ignored it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Max, despite being smug and standoffish, you&#039;re overconfident statements display severely flawed logic. 

It&#039;s common practice to link to articles/twitter posts/etc. that are being referred to in blog posts. Yeah, he links them to their page...but it&#039;s so they can be held accountable for what they posted. You also neglect the fact that he linked to Portnoy&#039;s apology...forgot to mention that, didn&#039;t you.

And holding posting a link against them makes no sense, pal.  If you love barstool so much, why do you care if they link to its site? Other than to try to sound big and tough, you don&#039;t care.

Other than being a barstool troll, like half the people who have commented, you clearly have no vested interest in other opinions. People have different viewpoints, you can either look at issue from another perspective (and learn and grow as a person) or be a belligerent douche. 

The only shit that needs to be cleaned up is the pile of it between your ears.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the author&#039;s link to someone else&#039;s deplorable comments just to get hits is deplorable. 

&quot;Do you enjoy posting pictures of naked children online? Apparently Boston Barstool Sports does.&quot; Boston Barstool Sports DID NOT post the pictures someone else did. And if you claim that by adding a link to the blog that pulls up the pic counts, then you ALSO posted pictures of naked children.

Is what barstool did childish? Yep, sure is. But so is most everything else there. I happen to be a grown adult with three little ones. I find the site humorous, and am not offended by the comments. They are a joke.

In addition, what IS offensive is all these people that think it&#039;s OK to have their kids running around nude at public beaches. Hey, there is a reason that they make swim diapers. And the most important is health reasons. I don&#039;t need to be stepping in poop because you were too cheap to put a diaper on your kid. I don&#039;t ever let my kids run naked in public. Not only do people not need to see their privates, they don&#039;t need to have them peeing and pooping all over the place.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While this photo may not necessarily be child pornography in the sense that it isn&#039;t innately explicit, that doesn&#039;t mean it should be acceptable to post it on a blog with a suggestive caption.  There seems to be a definite lack of judgement on the part of Barstool and I&#039;m not really sure how anybody on here can be supportive of exploiting a child like that just for walking naked on a beach. At least by general standards of society, a two year old hanging out naked on a beach is acceptable, I don&#039;t think the same can be said for people whipping out cameras and taking pictures of them and other adults proceeding to post those pictures with inappropriate captions to make a profit off of it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While the picture in and of itself isn&#039;t creepy (let&#039;s keep in mind the millions of pictures of babies in bathtubs that the proud parents post on Facebook), that caption is terrifying. &quot;MAN, LOOKIT THIS TWO-YEAR-OLD&#039;S JUNK, EH?&quot; Come on, grow up. That sounds like a comment a functioning alcoholic granddad is allowed to make, but not a blog (even if it is a sports blog).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My feeling is that if you want to follow or make fun of a celebrity, fine. But leave the kids alone. They have no say in how famous their parents are they can&#039;t defend themselves. 

His son is 2 years old. The picture of him naked is pornography. Maybe not graphic, but it is pornography. No parent should want a naked picture of their infant on the internet. (or anywhere, for that matter) And the comments, more than anything, are deplorable. What normal person talks about how big a two year old&#039;s penis is? That, my friends, is perverted.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes this is child pornography.
Parents who photograph their own children naked do not (usually) do so in an attempt to exploit their child’s genitalia, or post those photos on the internet.  
Portnoy crossed the line from a legal standpoint by specifically focusing on the child’s genitalia with his salacious comments.
The Nirvana album is exempt because the child is not identified and right or wrong most art is exempt from pornography laws.
As for those who say if you don’t want strangers commenting on your childs genitalia put a diaper on him – I say get into 2011.  Would you tell a rape victim they should have been dressed more modestly when they were attacked?]]></description>
