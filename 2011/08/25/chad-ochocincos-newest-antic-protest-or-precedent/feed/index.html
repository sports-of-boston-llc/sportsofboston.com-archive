		<description><![CDATA[Unconventional and unorthodox? Yes, but I Ochicinco seems like a sweet, generous guy. The offer to move in with a fan suggests an unspoiled guy who doesn&#039;t mind where he lays his head (so long as he has an XBox nearby). There&#039;s something impressively egalitarian and easygoing about this gesture, no? And his willingness to pay the fine for another guy? Yes, I suppose you could interpret this as challenging the NFL&#039;s status quo/rules. But again it seems like a generous thing to do. 

In an age when a lot of NFL players are out engaging in morally dubious activities--sexually harassing women, engaging in cruelly aggressive and under-handed tactics on the field, purchasing insanely oversized and ostentatious homes in a time when others are struggling to get by--I find Ochocinco a refreshingly sweet, magnanimous fellow. I wish more players were like him.]]></description>
