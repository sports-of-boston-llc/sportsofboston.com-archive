		<description><![CDATA[Not going to lie... I don&#039;t think his commentary was that uncomfortable. The guy was just joking around and everyone is freaking out about it. Sure his comments were absurd and vulgar but that&#039;s what gets people to keep coming back to Barstool. Portnoy has been using that same commentary to react to every news story let alone this one. I think this story is way too overblown because when I read the article I just thought to myself &quot;typical el pres response...guy is a clown.&quot;

People need to find better things to make a fuss about because El Pres is always going to be a staple in the city and WEEI is upset that nobody even listens to them anymore.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Completely agree with your response.  Kids will be kids and one on the beach should be a big deal... It was Portnoys commentary that crossed the line and was just uncomfortable to read.  Afterall, despite who Tom &#038; Gisele are professionally, they are parents and that role and their children need to be protected.]]></description>
