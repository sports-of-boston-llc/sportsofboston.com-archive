		<description><![CDATA[I voted for the guy, and I&#039;m all for him being a sports fan and all, (most presidents do have meet and greets with athletes) but I&#039;m beginning to question whether or not he spends a bit too much time/focus on this stuff.  Other presidents do meet athletes, but I never got the sense that any of them cracked jokes at their expense, or tried to be &#039;one of the guys&#039; and I don&#039;t understand Obama&#039;s need to do so.  He&#039;s a busy guy, it&#039;s a busy time - I&#039;m all for him taking vacations, watching sports, etc to blow off steam - but I think he needs to learn what is and isn&#039;t appropriate - even if it is just a matter of perception.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh get serious. Bully? Rondo is a highly-paid professional athlete.

Looks to me like you are engaging in some president bullying--which unfortunately has been an incessant tactic for the last several years by certain persons who often appear for example on Faux News.  Are you one of those?  I think you owe both us (the readers of this blog) and the President an apology for posting this BS.]]></description>
