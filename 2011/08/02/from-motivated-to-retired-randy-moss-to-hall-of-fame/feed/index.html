		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Gibbs! I think he&#039;ll come back. He&#039;s only 34, and may not be the burner he once was, but has plenty to offer a team. 

A lot of people are saying St. Louis catching balls from Sam Bradford alongside Mike Sims-Walker is a great fit. The Rams also have Josh McDaniells running the offense, so that would appear to make sense.

If you believe Cris Carter, Moss wanted to play for either the Jets or the Pats. Carter also claimed the Pats offered Moss a 1 year deal, but Moss wanted years.

The Pats gave those years to Chad Ochocinco.

But then again this is all coming from Cris Carter, who called Deion Branch &quot;Just another guy&quot; and was critical that the Pats got rid of him.]]></description>
