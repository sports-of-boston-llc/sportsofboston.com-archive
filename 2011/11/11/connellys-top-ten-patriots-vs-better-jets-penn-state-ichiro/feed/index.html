		<description><![CDATA[Good point about ND, PSU should take $40 to $50 MM right now and tell all the victims, we&#039;d like to talk about a process to help you deal with this atrocious problem, Therapy for life, we all come up with iron clad rules and processes for training and reporting on any kind of bad behavior so it never happens again, your kids go here for free (if you&#039;ll let them) and let&#039;s discuss what you think is reasonable compensation. We can never give you back what you lost, but we can start this way. That would be the first sensible thing they&#039;ve done in this mess.

REPLY - MPC - That makes 85% of their responsibility go away and is right thing to do - Doctors who apologize reduce malpractice suits significantly]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I see dead people&quot; coaching moment of all time: George Halas 	Last game: Nov, 1967 	Died: June, 1965

Sorry, I know it&#039;s just a typo, but couldn&#039;t resist. 

Re: Ichiro, Sox don&#039;t need another lefty OF.  

Was that the &quot;Punt, John, punt&quot; year for Indiana? 

Re: PSU — Guy who found the shower scene should have found a baseball bat and a phone to call cops, in that order. How he has looked at himself in the mirror for nine years, I have no idea.

REPLY - MPC - Thats how good George Halas is!]]></description>
