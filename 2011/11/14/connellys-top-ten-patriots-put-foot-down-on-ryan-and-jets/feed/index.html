		<description><![CDATA[Collinsworth loves the Patriots, are you kidding me? He is so far up there you know what. 

Boston will spend more than 50 million on closers over the next four years. 

Compensation for &quot;free agents&quot; that left Boston. 

Pedro---Clay B.
Johnny D.--Daniel Bard

I&#039;ll take the two picks because Boston has shown they know what to do with them. 

I would rather give up on a player a year or so too early. As opposed to hanging on to him too long. 

Pats should win out but as we all know the season doesn&#039;t start until January. That will define this team. 

Ga. will beat L.S.U. in the SEC Championship game. BCS will have a mess on their hands.

REPLY - MPC - I think LSU is too fast on defense for Georgia but I&#039;d love to see BCS a mess / Pats not built for playoffs / I like comp picks - let Ortiz go]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Best Sox closer in a clutch situation?  Lowe, Foulke, then maybe Papelbon.  He never put the team on his back like the other two.  Good luck in Philly, Boston got the best years out of him.

REPLY - MPC - They were all good - Foulke&#039;s contribution underrated should have been MVP. Only if Jimmy Williams didn&#039;t ask Flash Gordon to go two innings against Cleveland he would be on your list too]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Collinsworth really doesn’t like the Patriots&quot; - where do you get that?

On Papelbon: he is the best closer in Sox history.  It could be another 50 years before they find another one as good.

REPLY - MPC - As El Pres said - Sox have done all right in the bullpen with Foulke, Lowe, etc - they&#039;ll find someone to fill 95% void]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is it me, or are the Sunday night games the equivalent of Red Sox Yankees now with 3 hours only a faint dream? Looked up at halftime and it was 10:14. Sorry, I don&#039;t know what time it finished. Move it along guys.
