Your credibility goes out the window when you talk about the drinking as a non-issue. It&#039;s absolutely an issue, simply because it&#039;s a symptom of the fact that he quit on his team. As people have said, if they make the playoffs nobody talks about it. Well, they didn&#039;t and Josh Beckett was as much to blame if not more so than anybody else. Face it, he got just plain fat and if you think that didn&#039;t contribute to their failures, then you don&#039;t have a clue. And if you&#039;ve ever been around any team, if the top guy is both lazy and not producing, that can and seems like in this case it did have some pretty devastating effects on everybody else. 
 
Now, should they let him go? NO, NO and triple NO. They can&#039;t get anybody worth it in return and he does have a ton of talent. He can and should be the ace or A1 of the staff. 

But to basically say every fan is an idiot and somehow you know better when the evidence was plain as the gut hanging over his belt for the last 6 weeks of the season is both incorrect and dumb.]]></description>
