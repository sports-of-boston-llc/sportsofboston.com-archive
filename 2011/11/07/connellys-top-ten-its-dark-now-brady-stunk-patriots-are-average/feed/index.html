		<description><![CDATA[You nailed the &quot;Patriots Offense&quot; section.
- Just like super bowl; pat&#039;s wait way to late to go to hurry-up offense, and Belicheck outcoached again by Coughlin.

- Slater has been 2nd option on kick-offs since he fumbled.  He&#039;s much better than Woody on returns.

-  Woody on kick-offs and Brady under pressure look a little timid.

- Just like Faulk the coaches manage Taylor Price out of this week&#039;s game.

- Two injured Pat&#039;s (both eventually walked off) failure to get off the field forcing Pat&#039;s to stop the clock preserved time and time outs for the Giants.

- Wonder how Parcell would have done if he actually did shop for the groceries?  Is the coaching and admin staffs stronger or weaker than the roster?

REPLY - MPC - You would have to say that Parcells couldn&#039;t have done worse / sad to say how many times we&#039;re saying (and he) that Belichick was outcoached / Maybe the hits Brady has taken are adding up]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[-Happy for Duquette.
-Belichick should get every accolade for the 3 rings. But he should also get all the criticism for wasting the last 3-4 years of Brady with all his undrafted free agents, trading down and stock piling picks. 
-Spikes&#039; Charleston routine is nauseating. Some veteran should slap him.
-Who was the Globe writer yesterday that said the Pats may not lose another game this season...? 
-Yes, they should have left Edelman in the tank.  He was awful.  
-Raise your hand if you feel good about our prospects Sunday night?

REPLY - MPC - Jets are by far a more talented team / Belichick will have statues around here but to date his GM and coaching has been below average /Duquette will be fun for the Baltimore media]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How about them Bruins? They totaly dominate the Maple Leafs 7-0 and not one word about them. And you go on and on about a crappy *Patriots team. Shame on you MPC

REPLY - MPC - You need to be more through when you read - I mentioned Tyler Seguin&#039;s updated goal pace. What else would you want about a November NHL game?]]></description>
