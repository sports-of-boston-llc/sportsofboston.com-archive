		<description><![CDATA[I saw some interesting comparison stats on Tebow vs. Elway in their first 8 games as starters.  Tebow beats him in every category by a pretty wide margin.
Elway 3-5
Tebow 5-3
Elway 1041 passing yards
Tebow 1281
Elway 3-10 TD to Int.
Tebow 10-4
Elway 92 rushing yards
Tebow 550
Elway 1 TD
Tebow 5

The kid can play football!

I couldn&#039;t agree more on Kuechly.  I hate to say it, but he should leave if it doesn&#039;t look like it will get better out there.
You are so right about Rettig - he&#039;s terrified to get hit.  He makes Tony Eason look like Tebow.

Robert Griffin III is a special player. He has such a strong arm and it&#039;s effortless - plus his wheels. 
Corso made me hit the dvr rewind about 5 times to check if I heard what I thought heard.  Herbstreit and Fowler&#039;s reactions answered that question.  I hope he doesn&#039;t get in trouble too much for that one one.  I&#039;m sure he feels badly today - his grandchildren watch the show.
Still sick about Penn St.

REPLY - MPC - As always we&#039;re on the same page - Corso apologized. Hope thats the end of it and not some corporate suit says he&#039;s getting too old. Kirk and Fowler were a howl.  Amazing Elway&#039;s reaction to Tebow TD - he was pissed]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[BCS fatcats rooting for LSU-Bama, not unhappy at all, IMHO, with rash of recent upsets. 
Good grief, does this sport need a playoff system, like every other level of college football. It would be exciting and enrich many, just not the entrenched interests. Until then, hard to get excited. 

You couldn&#039;t be more right about Herzlich, not to mention any number of other linebackers Pats could have drafted instead of another mediocre cornerback in recent years.

REPLY - MPC - I disagree - a rematch of an already boring game isn&#039;t best for them. They would have loved a conference to conference game ideally SEC and PAC 10.]]></description>
