		<description><![CDATA[Re: Cheering for Auburn

Auburn is the &quot;wanna be school &quot;  Their coaches have said they have been cheating for years , same for their players and they are the worst cheap shot artists in the conference . So go ahead and cheer for the team most hated in the conference (SEC).  
But Alabama is like most places , you find good and bad .  But its a  lot friendlier than i found Boston.  Its like most places and people, if you insult them , they will insult you back.  I&#039;ve worked in the Boston metro area , now in Texas, and i find most places are what you make of them .   But you probably will have the attitude of my wife&#039;s niece , &quot;Boston is just better than any other place , because we aren&#039;t bigoted like everyone else.&quot;
Roll Tide. ( Not that you would understand what that means.) P.s The show you referenced was b.s.
Oh , you will need to work on your accent so people will be able to understand you.  such as there is an R in car and park.]]></description>
