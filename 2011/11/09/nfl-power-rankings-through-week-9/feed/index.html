		<description><![CDATA[Why would you care to watch the Bengals?  Well I&#039;m 46 years old and have been a fan for more than 31 years, thru all of the good and bad and I will tell you this, they have been playing some exciting ball. I&#039;m happy to say that I&#039;m not a fan only when they are winning and if you take time to watch, you will see that we have some really good talent and that is why they are getting the job done. Also 4 of their 6 wins have been come from behind wins, they are not giving up, playing with heart and playing to win]]></description>
