		<description><![CDATA[Pedroia is 28. Yes he plays hard, but I just took a look at HOF 2nd basemen: They aged well. 
Let&#039;s say if Pedroia plays respectably for 7 more years, he has a shot; he&#039;d be 35. 
These are OPS numbers for 2b HOFers at age 35:
Carew: .830
Morgan: .733 (rose to .838 5 years later)
Collins: .804
Fox: .657 (career .710)
Frisch: .757
Lazzeri: .814
And one non-HOF:
Grich: .805

I could offer more: Second basemen hold up pretty well. Pedey has a real chance at HOF barring injury - which, as you say, is possible because he plays hard. But statistically those in his position last.

REPLY - MPC - I hope so he is the most sincere athlete I&#039;ve seen since Dave Cowens]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If Pedroia, AGon, and Papelbon keep doing what they have been doing for another 4-5 years, their chances will look pretty good.

REPLY - MPC - Pedroia and Papelbon more likely - A Gon third on your list]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With VermontK re Pedey HOF; Agon may be the least exciting version of it, but his numbers will likely do very well for his HOF possibilities.

1980 stars are doing extremely well, considering they were stars 31 years ago in the movies.  Not where they were, but doing a lot better than their 1949 counterparts were doing in 1980 (31 year gap):  I didn&#039;t catch too many movies with 1949&#039;s leading men: Joseph Cotton, Orson Welles (wine ads don&#039;t count ;), Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Dennis Price.

REPLY - MPC - Pedroia my favorite player can he continue to stress his body like he does to make it to HOF / Those 80&#039;s guys keep doing movies though]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Never mind forgetting how good Chris Herron was - I have forgotten who he was!  Let&#039;s see:  2d round pick, played 70 games in the NBA.  What is the big deal here?

REPLY - MPC - I was speaking more to his Durfee / Fresno days - amazing story]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hmmm, wouldn&#039;t discount Pedroia for HOF - seriously, 7-8 more years at this pace is realistic, already an MVP and Gold Glover (yes, I know Gold Gloves are tarnished when they award them to the Jeter statue, but still). 

Re: Tiki - I think people remember the Giants got better without him, and those inside know why. Rumors he&#039;s not the best team guy.

REPLY - MPC - Can Pedroia&#039;s body withstand 7-8 years at his pace / good point on Giants getting better]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[#5
I think (barring injury or trade...and they better not trade this #1 pick this time) that #19 Tyler Seguin should be added to that list as he is showing signs of greatness

#7 
Joe Thornton - traded from the Bruins to the Sharks for a bag of used hockey pucks.

REPLY - MPC - Seguin a long way to go before being added to list of greats - Thornton trade set back Bruins five years - still needed to be traded but offered to every team in the league and if not value then keep him and deal with the uninspired star]]></description>
