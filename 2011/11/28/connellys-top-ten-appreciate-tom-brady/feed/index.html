		<description><![CDATA[All of your Heisman picks seem to be good guys as well.  They&#039;re the reason why I love college football.  I think I would have to go with Robert Griffin III - he makes it look effortless.  

Psyched about Tebow.  I hope this keeps going.  If Keuchly doesn&#039;t win a major award at that awards night in Disney World there should be a federal investigation and every one in BC&#039;s athletic office should be fired.

REPLY - MPC - When I get home my email box will be filled with promos from Oklahoma, Alabama and others pushing their players for awards. For crying out loud some schools have hung 15 story images of their players from high rises to get attention. Not BC they&#039;re too busy not building a baseball field and making sure the whales on their cordoroy pants don&#039;t swim away]]></description>
