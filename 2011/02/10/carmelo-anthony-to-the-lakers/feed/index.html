		<description><![CDATA[I DONT SEE ANYTHING IN ANDREW BYNUM I WOULD TRADE HIM IN A HEART BEAT. THERE IS NO UPSIDE WITH THIS GUY.JERRY BUSS SON GOT TO BE CRAZY NOT TO ACQUIRE CARMELO ANTHONY.

I GET SICK TO MY STOMACH TINKING ABOUT THIS. YOU WILL NEVER WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP WITH THIS GUY HE IS NOT MOTIVATED LIKE KOBE AND KOBE IS GETTING REALLY TIRED AND BURN OUT TRYING TO MOTIVATE ALL THESE PLAYER HE HAS NOW.

THEY NEED A REAL POINT GUARD AND STEVE BLAKE IS A JOKE AND ANY COLLEGE POINT GUARD RIGHT NOW IS BETTER THAN ANYTHING THE LAKERS HAS.

I WOULD TRADE EVERYBODY BUT KOBE BYRANT AND SURROUND KOBE WITH YOUNG LEGS AND GET BACK TO RUNNING LIKE THE OLD LAKERS.]]></description>
