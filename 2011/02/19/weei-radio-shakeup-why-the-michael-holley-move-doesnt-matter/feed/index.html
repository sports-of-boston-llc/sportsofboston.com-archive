		<description><![CDATA[Part 2 i was way over the limit lol

Minahane makes D n C listenable when not on their Political rants. The other day Dennis actually said Michael Sam was more of a scumbag for taking a picture in front of the vatican in spite of them than they were for molesting little boys. It&#039;s really gotten that absurd. Like I said Kirk is refreshing but the personal beefs need to be toned down a bit. His beef with 98.5 was fine but now its like every other guy in Boston media. We get it Kirk. You&#039;re not afraid to throw down. I will say I have grown to like Mike Muttnansky Alot at night. He is very knowlegable for someone my age and he does well as toning Mikey&#039;s homerism down a bit which is his bigggest flaw. I like Mikey a lot always have so from 6-midnight they got me back. With Dale n Holley back together they mostly have me back at that time slot but IDK how I feel about Jerry yet. Its kind of annoying having him disrupt their near perfect chemistry. The mid day I have issues with still. Its obviously lacking another star. Lou is actually growing on me a lot but he is a bit on the boring side so he needs to becomplimented correctly. Christian is the one I think should have a more limited role. I think Benz takes more heat for the Steelers thing than is deserved. He&#039;s a good host. I know it was stale but I&#039;d take the Big O with Freddy and Stave etc over this crap anyday but thats just me. Luckily the Big O gives us a 3rd option mid days but its not as good as it used to be. Michael Holley was replying to my tweets during the show the other day so I appreciate they have come around on the interactive stuff. Its the best way to reach these guys fast. I do it on the national shows too. They&#039;ll read the Tweets more often than not overnight. 

  To sum it up. After 2 pm it&#039;s pretty much WEEI but before its more 98.5 for me. All WEEI&#039;s fans know we were ignored by them and any &quot;loyalty&quot; they had built up with their fan base is seriously shaken. We sat there as a new station came in with an FM signal and WEEI sat on their hands. They followed that up by axing their best talents and leaving other greats like Holley stranded on an island. Does anyone know the real motivation for all this? Seems like it was mismanaged on purpose. The WEEI app is much better than what The Sports Hub has and I feel that is huge. Many people like myself listen via our phone while on the go. It&#039;s very easy to use but I don&#039;t understand why we can&#039;t access complete show archives instead of just the segments they choose. I just stumbled across their podcasts a few weeks ago and there is some decent stuff on there as well. I hope they right their ship but I have a feeling that from now on I will always check The Sports Hub if I don&#039;t like what&#039;s on EEI. That&#039;s their fault. They sat there and let it happen. Do you think we want to channel surf? NOPE. But you caused it.

Not that it matters but we do take this stuff seriously. I spent thousands to go to Conn. School Of Broadcasting and try and break into that industry. Sports radio was my passion. What they happen to EEI was just wrong.

		<description><![CDATA[I can say I have been listening to sports radio, more so than music for over 15 years. Since i was in my early 20&#039;s, maybe even 19 or so. I&#039;m 37 now so I have built somewhat of an allegiance to WEEI or to be more fair a level of comfort with it&#039;s hosts. Well that was the best thing it had in its conrner was it&#039;s loyal fan base. People would not have switched over to 98.5 but the management moves at WEEI were more than questionable. You pretty much stated it all in your article but I will share my thoughts as well. Being a sports radio nut sure If it were a long interview I wasnt interested in at all or maybe a blowout game or something, sure I&#039;d check out 98.5 real quick but I&#039;d always come back to WEEI fast. Why? Well cuz &quot;I knew those guys&quot; Well it got to a point where those GUYS were all getting let go or shuffled around. The wrong ones though. Change is always needed. Nothing is forever especially in ratings based wars but if you are trying to run a station first off I totally disagree with cutting your talent or their salary to make more money. All you end up doing is hurting the product for your listeners, but they cut DALE ARNOLD and The Big O but they retain Dennis and Callahan who at times sound like you are listening to a Fox News Podcast. I don&#039;t understand the managerial decisions. This drove away any loyalty guys like myself had with them. I became so frustrated with the sub par broadcasting from them decimating The Big Show and The Dale And Holley show which in my opinion is one of the best in the whole country. I became frustrated with local sports radio all together but when I got back into it I was now 50/50 between the Sports Hub and WEEI.

A few months ago if I wrote this I would rant on n on how WEEI is just terrible but it is improving in some areas but not others. D n C are still on!!  Refreshingly though they have a third voice in Kirk Minihane who makes it listenable except when they go all hardcore Republican on you. I understand]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The worst thing WEEI did was to cancel Dale and Holley. I have nothing against Ordway but I knew it would never work out. I listened to WEEI everyday when Dale and Holley were on-I actually planned my day around it.More woman would listen if hosts like D and H were on. They are knowledgeable sports people without being rude and vulgar.I haven&#039;t recouped from the D and H cancellation in 2 years. I really miss them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My only draw to WEEI was Dale and Holley. The morning show BLOWS!! Mutt and Lou are ok in a pinch and on par with Gresh and Zo only during baseball season. The Big Show has its moments but again it just seems like Glenn with a guest Holley. Bring back D and H and I will listen again. Other then that the Hub is the place to be. Think of the advantage WEEI had on the hub with its loyal listeners and the fact you can listen almost anywhere in New England. Now I listen on my smartphone (which I pay for)to the Hub.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John Dennis is a complete buffoon. How the Pats put their players on that junk show is beyond me. 

Thank God narrow-minded luddites, who proudly profess their uneducated belief system (yes, science would scare J Dennis) are on the way out.

J Dennis deserves his own YouTube channel, with flag draped in the background, sitting in some hoarder-esque den, in a wifebeater, drinking beer and ranting. That&#039;s the mental image I think of when that crab of a man is unfortunately mentioned in my ear-shot.

Good riddance to J Dennis, he is on his way out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some excellent comments here. WEEI didn&#039;t care what their audience had to say, and that&#039;s never good for any business. I took the time to send a letter to Jason Wolfe awhile back. It was in reference to Steve DeOssie and it articulated my dislike for how he treated many callers. Not only was it demeaning, the bullying was uncomfortable to listen to. I also took the time to offer an opinion on Glenn Ordway&#039;s incessant repeating. I did think he was knowledgeable, but he has the habit of repeating the same thing over-and-over. Listeners aren&#039;t morons. Repeating yourself will not change their minds. In fact it makes for boring, irritating listening. Back to the arrogance.... Jason Wolfe NEVER responded back to me. 98.5 has its flaws, for sure, but it is infinitely more listenable than WEEI. They didn&#039;t care... they didn&#039;t bother to listen, and now look, a pretty marginal competitor is gobbling up market share. Jason, you only have yourself to blame...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[in giving the 10 to 2 show to Mut and Merloni WEEI shot themselves in the foot. I enjoy D &#038; C in the morning and i did listen to Dale and Holley. I never could stand the Big show with everyone talking aat once. Weei would have been better served to move Dale &#038; Holley to PM drive. Dale is a true gentlemen and he and Holley presented a knowledgable and entertaining sports show. now i listen to WEEI till 10AM and to the ballgames. Otherwise i listen to 98.5 0r newsradio 1030. Why not put Dale on at 1pm to 3?]]></description>
