		<description><![CDATA[If anyone thinks the Red Sox or any other team in this division is going to win upwards of a 100 games you are not paying attention.
The days of beating up on the Orioles and Rays are over while the Orioles are still not world beaters they still will improve to at least an 78-80 win team , and that might be the worst team in the division if the worst team has 80 wins how is any team going to win 100 or more games.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While I do think the Sox will win 96 or so and the Yankees seem like more of a 92 win team, I&#039;d caution anyone who writes off the Rays. Crawford is a big loss that can&#039;t be replaced, but Damon is serviceable enough. Carlos Pena&#039;s power will be tough to replace, too, but his .196 average wasn&#039;t exactly doing the team any good. Brignac is a talented player who can definitely replace Bartlett, Garza had an ERA near 4.00 when everything was said and done so Hellickson won&#039;t be much of a dropoff, and I&#039;d expect Wade Davis to get better too. Count on a better year from Zobrist as well, and I think Longoria is better than he 22 homers he had last year. The bullpen lost a lot of arms, but just because the guys they have back there now are unproven doesn&#039;t mean they aren&#039;t good. Adam Russell and Jake McGee are good relievers. While Tampa will need a lot to go right to challenge Boston or New York, I think they&#039;re an 88 win team that will lock up the third spot easily.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Red Sox should win the division barring injuries. They finally caught the Yankees, although being very hypocritical about &quot;buying a pennant.&quot;The Yankees could fall to third place if Burnett continues his downward spiral.They have no left handed pitching to counter a heavy handed Boston line up. Gardner should lead off and drop an aging Jeter to the 2 spot. The only hope for the Yankees is a miracle season from Garcia or Colon - wishful thinking at best. The rest of the division is a wash.]]></description>

Pencil the Sox and Yankees in for at least 95 wins each, with the Sox taking the division by a game or 2.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Add at least 10 wins to the Red Sox, subtract a bunch from the Yankees, and I&#039;d say you&#039;d have something more accurate then. Though I&#039;m leaning a bit towards knocking the Rays barely down to 4th with Damon and Manny&#039;s age and all their key free agents leaving.]]></description>
