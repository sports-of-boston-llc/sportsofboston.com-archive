People that watch the game don&#039;t go with the only hope to see a fight....they would watch an entire game without a fight...play hockey and save the fights for the ring, not the ice; play the sport and battle the other sticks on the puck, not who has the biggest ego with the most overload of testosterone...not to mention it trickles down to the youth...can you imagine watching a football game or a basketball game where the players can start taking punches at each other....exactly!]]></description>
