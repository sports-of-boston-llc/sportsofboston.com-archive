		<description><![CDATA[Is being the Paul Silas of the Celts anything like being the Osiris of the Wu? It is no doubt a tough trade, but the C&#039;s had to make it and will be better for it long-term. My pocket theory, which you not surprisingly pointed out Dave(y) D, was that Perk on OKC could truly result in an earlier-than-the-finals exit for LAL or SAS, which would make the C&#039;s even closer to a title themselves especially with their now-better-suited-to-guard-the-East line-up. Will Jeff Green be the new James Posey? Perhaps. But the real question is will he be the new Luscious Pusey. And will Kristic just get a wiffle already - his hair looks like Lidia Bastianich&#039;s.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[great trade. celts weren&#039;t going to sign him anyway and they got a young fast forward.  THEY NEED SPEED TO COMPETE WITH mIAMI.
Perkins  health was a big issue.
they went 34-10 without him and 4-3 with him. enough said.
he will most likely get injured and not play much.
He was greedy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I enjoy the trade. Perkins&#039; health was too unreliable, and for those of you who haven&#039;t noticed, Krstic, who also came over in the trade, is a big man himself, and actually a decent shooter. Plus, he got six offensive rebounds the other night.]]></description>
