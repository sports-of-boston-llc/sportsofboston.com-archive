		<description><![CDATA[Everyone the Celtics traded away &quot;size&quot; -- but they neglect to mention that Krstic is taller than Perk!

The 6 offensive boards is an aberration with Krstic, but it looks like he&#039;s tougher on the glass than I thought. I agree with your larger point, Ken!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What a wonderful sight!  A Boston center who gets 6 offensive rebounds, can hit a 16 foot jumper, doesn&#039;t set a single moving pick, earns no technical fouls, and doesn&#039;t need to dribble a ball before going up for a shot around the basket.  Yeah, I&#039;m really going to miss Perkins.

And damn, what a shame Nate Robinson is no longer Rondo&#039;s backup at point guard.  D. West looks like he never left his Boston home.  He&#039;s going to make a huge difference.]]></description>
