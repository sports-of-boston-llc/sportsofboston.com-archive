		<description><![CDATA[This is a dream come true.  I literally cheered out loud when I heard that Perkins and Robinson were gone.  Watching Perkins come back from his injury with all of his old habits was horrifying.  Moving picks, the inability to stop bringing the ball down before winding up for a dunk, slow as molasses, and making errant or disinterested passes - I&#039;ll never know what everybody raves about with this injury prone, technical foul prone creature who is virtually unable to score if more than 3 feet from the basket.  Good riddance.  Same for Nate the great, who consistently launched ill advised, errant 3 pointers, and never lived up to whatever potential he was supposed to have.  Trading Eddie House for him was one of the all time bonehead moves for the Celtics.

Jeff Green will be a fine addition and Krstic might actually play more than a few weeks without an injury.  Yay for this trade!]]></description>
