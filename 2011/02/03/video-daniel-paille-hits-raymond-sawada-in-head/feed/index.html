		<description><![CDATA[OK, I did watch the game. I&#039;m not going to hate Matt Cooke for his hit, yet let Daniel Paille off the hook for his hit. The new rules do not allow shots directly to the head. 

The hit was directly on Sawada&#039;s head, and while I don&#039;t think he intended to hit him in the head, he deserves to be suspended. Oh wait, look at that! He was. For four games.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, but obviously you didn&#039;t even watch the game.  It was a heavy shoulder to shoulder hit through the center.  Too bad Sawada painted a bull&#039;s eye on himself and got leveled, but that is hockey.  Try actually watching the game and looking at the footage - schmucks like you ruining hockey for the real fans out there.]]></description>
