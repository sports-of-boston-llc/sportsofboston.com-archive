		<description><![CDATA[All those &quot;experts&quot; who moaned and groaned over the loss of Perkins and Robinson should at least have the decency to apologize for their shortsightedness.  I stood up and cheered when those two were traded, and I haven&#039;t stopped yet.  Is anybody actually missing all those misfired 3 pointers of Robinson?  Or the pathetic attempts to score from anywhere beyond 3 feet by Perk, or his illegal picks that invariably broke up a scoring play, or his technical fouls, or the many times guards stole the ball from him because he could never learn to go straight to the dunk without putting the ball on the floor?

Yeah, it&#039;s awful to have Jeff Greene instead of Robinson, and Krstic&#039;s rebounds and scoring are just so horrible.  Come on - admit it - Ainge made a brilliant trade.]]></description>
