		<description><![CDATA[That punk deserved it. With 10 pt lead he was dancing around. Everyone knows the difference between a practice shot a real shot, especially when the clock is still running. I love that that player gave him a mild beating. Didn&#039;t mention that the suns backup players were the ones that scored all of those points. Starters didn&#039;t even play second half. And not to mention. Kg is cheapass punk. I hope someone slides their foot under him and he fractures his femur and tears an mcl. Would pay to see that, used to have respect for him. Oh well.]]></description>
