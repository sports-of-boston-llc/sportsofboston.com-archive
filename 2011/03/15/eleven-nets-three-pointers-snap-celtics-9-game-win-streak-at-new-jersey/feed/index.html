		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment, Ken! It&#039;s true that statistically March has been rough on Rondo. His minutes, shots, shooting percentage, assists, rebounds and point averages are all the lowest of any month this season. But his turnovers (3.0 per game) are actually the lowest as well, so you might be wrong there.
This season-ending decline is odd for Rondo, who in the past hasn&#039;t shown a tendency to get worse as the season goes on. His minutes are a little down, but it&#039;s unclear if that&#039;s causing the poor performances or is caused by the poor performances.
It&#039;s possible that Rondo&#039;s injuries are cropping up again, or are nagging at him just enough to affect his play without taking him out of the game. He appeared to tweak his ankle during this game, but he returned later, so who knows how bad it was.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rondo had one of his weaker games.  His shooting just gets worse and worse (can&#039;t remember his percentage against the Nets, but it looked awful), and his passes don&#039;t seem quite as crisp lately.  Either he&#039;s tired or injured, it seems, and I&#039;d say he&#039;s turning the ball over more as well.  Any idea what&#039;s up with him?]]></description>
