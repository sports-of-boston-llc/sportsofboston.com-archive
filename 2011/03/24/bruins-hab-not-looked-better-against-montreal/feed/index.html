		<description><![CDATA[The problem is with the Habs first line playing against the Bruins first line. When the Habs line outplay their first line, and forecheck heavily it creates chances to score goals. We saw that in the first 2 games. The Bruins have been crushing this lately. But the Bruins first line is vulnerable. Lucic is not playing well. Horton is almost an after thought despite his goal. Any thoughts?]]></description>
