		<description><![CDATA[Well, KC, I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s a &quot;shock&quot; anymore to see the Celtics dissolve.  Either they fall far behind early in the game, or manage to blow a lead late.  Tired legs, tired bodies, and maybe tired brains.  Please, enough with the &quot;we miss Perk&quot; stuff.  The guy missed 2/3 of the season and you poor guys looked much, much better back then while Perk was injured.  

I&#039;d be &quot;shocked&quot; if the Celts finish ahead of the Heat, and you can forget about catching the Bulls.  And just what does &quot;chemistry&quot; have to do with Pierce blowing 2 critical free throws, Allen missing every shot he took in the second half, and Baby seemingly doing anything he could to get needless fouls at the end?  Is it chemistry that has Rondo walking the ball up the court and the team standing around until there&#039;s 10 seconds left on the 24 second clock before they think about scoring?  You&#039;d think being paid 9 to 14 million dollars a year would buy a little chemistry, wouldn&#039;t you?]]></description>
