		<description><![CDATA[Good start, although not a lot we can&#039;t get better from Finn. There can&#039;t be enough Gresh critique for my liking and it is good to see a voice of reason on the surprisingly polarizing Gary T. The piece could stand some editing, waayy too &#039;words for words sake&#039; and adverb-y and perhaps we should toggle the spell check (proffessional?)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fair enough. I get that. Felger does draw the attention seeking stigma. My main admiration is his willingness to be right as well as be wrong.

I just feel like, right now, If ESPN were to hold a PTI: City vs City tourney, who do we pick over Felger? Maybe Holley? 

Here is my full take, which I alluded to in the column..
