		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not like he&#039;s being inducted into the hall of fame.  He is simply making a new mark in the franchise.  And although he may not have been as dominant at the others, what&#039;s wrong with a player who has done so much for the organization in terms of charity, reliability, and character, getting at least one accolade that recognizes him for the efforts on the field.  So it took him a long time, he has still been an integral part of everything the Sox have done for years, win or lose.  You will have 192 reasons to be thankful we had him!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;It should be noted, that this record will be set because of nearly 20 years of consistency and not because of outright domination. It took Clemens 13 seasons to reach the mark and it only took Young a remarkably low 8 seasons as a Boston Red Sox to set the record.&quot;

How long did it take Cal Ripken to win the Iron Man record? He did it a lot faster than Lou Gehrig, since there were more games each season. The record still stands. 

So what if it&#039;s taken him longer, the man has stayed in the game to achieve this record and should receive the appropriate adulation.

&quot;Tim Wakefield was never (and still isn’t) a dominate pitcher.&quot;

Depends on what day you see him pitch - there have been many days when he has been unhittable. I remember comparisons between him, Schilling and Pedro in 2004, and there was a strong argument that he was the best pitcher in the rotation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can see your point, Wakefield has never been as dominant as Clemens or Young as you can see in both his era and his longevity compared to the other two. 

However, I think it is a testament to Wakefield that he has lasted so long in a league dominated by power, with a finesse pitch. Also I personally would rather have Wakefield representing the Red Sox than Clemens: he has been loyal to the team and fans, and he has always done whatever the team has asked of him, from starting to long relief to even closer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[quite possibly the stupidest post ever about the Red Sox...Clemens had nothing but contempt for the fans and said &quot;I&quot; in every sentence and tried to seduce a freaking teenager at 28...Wakefield not as dominant as the Rocket?...wow, brilliant analysis...it counts being a decent person, and I can not wait untill we get that stain off the record book...I live in CO now, but worked at Fenway for a couple of years in the 70s, and have a 5 year old who loves the Sox...if he wishes to emulate Wake, I would be a proud dad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What you do, as many others do, is mistakenly equate power or speed with dominance.  I suppose if you&#039;re dumb enough to think the only thing that matters in a pitcher is putting up 99mph fastballs you would underestimate Wakefield&#039;s skill.  That&#039;s typical of most folks viewing of knucklers -- vastly underrated because they&#039;re not flashy.
Fortunately, in baseball at least, results matter, and the numbers don&#039;t lie -- at his best, Wakefield has been just as (if not moreso) effective as the so-called &quot;Rocket&quot;, just in a different way.

Sure, people get excited about touchdowns more than field goals, about the home run hitters more than the guys who consistently hit clutch singles and doubles, and about the loud &#038; flashy more than the stolid and workmanlike.

But the numbers don&#039;t lie.  Wake&#039;s been a very, very good player for a very, very long time (in baseball years).  Had he not been relagated to the bullpen for many years, he&#039;d have passed the other two a long time ago.  He absolutely deserves recognition, particularly since he managed to accomplish what he has in a system where the deck is stacked against him.

Just because Young and Clemens were great in their own way, doesn&#039;t diminish how amazing Wakefield is.  Just because you like vanilla doesn&#039;t mean chocolate isn&#039;t a good flavour too.]]></description>
