		<description><![CDATA[Yea this is an anomaly  and a horrific tragedy but , the announcers are announcers...just talking about what they see and calling the game. How were they to know that the fall killed him? Shit I mean he died but the announcers were just trying to make light of the situation that they obviously didn&#039;t have full knowledge of; they have too feel horrible about the incident and what was said, but get off them.  Both of them hoping that the man was ok at the end of the video. Seriously , tragedies like this happen, thats just the way life is unfortunately.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, to both Judy&#039;s and Robby&#039;s comments - this is a tragedy and yet you people have the nerve to sit on your high horses judging this man, as if it&#039;s going to justify what happened. Shame on you both! You have no idea what kind of person, father this man was and your comments are so ignorant, it&#039;s pathetic. The little boy is in my prayers. Take this video down, it&#039;s so disrespectful!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s good that this video is still on the air.  I hope it will teach people to use their brains and avoid risking their lives standing in front of low rails anywhere.  If not for themselves, at least for the sake of their families.  After all, even when relaxing and having fun, we should always use our brains at all times.  I cannot believe this guy was almost 40, a fireman, and acting so stupidly.  That rail was clearly below his waist.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Anyone who saw that knew that poor guy was in serious trouble as soon as it happened. But the announcers think it&#039;s a joke? They should be fired, they are an embarressment to the entire organization. They owe the family an apology too.]]></description>
