		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m just wondering why both clubs felt like they had to get involved. After all, it was just between Ortiz and Gregg. And yes, this is something that has been going on since the beginnings of the game. The pitcher starts to test the batter by trying to brush him back. Finally he gets the kind of response that he got from Ortiz that night, which has happened before, but not with the entirety of both teams joining in, unless they were trying to break up the fracas. However, such was definitely not the case here. Everyone was just looking for a &quot;boys&#039; night out&quot; here. If they all hadn&#039;t joined in, maybe Ortiz and Gregg would have only been ejected and not suspended like they were.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that this is apart of the game. A pitcher throws inside to get a power hitter thinking trying to get into his head, but also the pitcher needs to realize that when doing this he may get his ass handed to him. All the great pitchers did this:Nolan Ryan,Roger Clemens,Tom Glavine just to name a few. If it was me I would of threw it high inside make him get a little dirty, he is a ball player not GOD]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[They both are in the wrong.  I don&#039;t really blame Ortiz for charging because Gregg needed to have his ass handed to him for playing like that.  What a little bitch.  Gregg definitely should be ejected!  Ortiz too, obviously.]]></description>

So you&#039;re condoning that it&#039;s okay for pitchers to throw at batters, or brush them back?  I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve heard the saying, &quot;For every action, there&#039;s an opposite but equal reaction.&quot;  If the pitcher can&#039;t handle it, then he shouldn&#039;t be locating his pitches that far inside.  The pitcher should&#039;ve been ejected too, because there was no need for it when his team, which is below .500, is getting pounded by 7-runs in the 8th inning.  To me, that&#039;s bush league.  Don&#039;t get me wrong, I hate both teams, but it&#039;s just my opinion.

		<description><![CDATA[I thought the fight was totally bush league.  I love Big Papi, but I think he should have been ejected for charging the mound.  A batter has no business leaving the batter&#039;s box or baselines and running around on the grass, and MLB should change its rules to make that an automatic ejection (and automatic out).]]></description>
