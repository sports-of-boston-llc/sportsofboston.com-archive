				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, the New York Daily News printed an article with the back page headline &#8220;Papelbum&#8221; because Red Sox closer, Papelbon, said that he should close the All-Star game instead of Yankees player, Mariano Rivera. The tabloid quoted him saying, &#8220;If I was managing the team, I would close. I&#8217;m not managing the team, so it don&#8217;t matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, what they forgot to mention in their headline was that he also praised Rivera and admitted that he both liked and respected him. He also admitted that he was not expecting to close and that he thought Rivera had earned the spot.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For most Americans, Friday, July 4th was a great day. Families were having barbecues and many towns had Independence Day fireworks. Red Sox fans had even more reason to celebrate, after beating the Yankees at Yankee Stadium.</p>
<p>However, according to <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2008/07/06/ny_man_attacked_with_bat_police_say/">boston.com</a>, this wasn&#8217;t enough to satisfy a group of young people in Falmouth, MA. The group noticed a car stuck in traffic with New York license plates and began to harass the family, accusing them of being Yankees fans.</p>
<p>According to police, the driver stepped out of the car and asked the group to stop since there were children in the car. That&#8217;s when 20-year-old Robert D. Correia beat the man with a baseball bat while another member of the group slammed the man&#8217;s body into the car.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2008/07/12/not-another-pink-hat-7-11-08/">Not Another Pink Hat 7-11</a> (219 words)</p>

That&#8217;s right, Gloucester, MA native <strong>David Sanborn </strong>was ordered by a California jury to pay $25,297 ($15,297 for medical costs and $10,000 punitive damages) to Yanks fan <strong>Mario Melendez </strong>after his role in a 2006 bar fight.</p>

Yet, most fans will admit that the rivalry is all in good fun and at the end of the day it&#8217;s just a game.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to the <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/news/regional/general/view.bg?articleid=1088345">Boston Herald</a>, Boston College&#8217;s star defensive end, Brady Smith, was charged with sexual assault and breaking and entering that occurred early Saturday morning. The 20-year-old junior started 12 games last year, contributing to the team&#8217;s impressive 11-3 season. He has been issued a summary suspension from the university and has been indefinitely suspended from the Eagles football team. Smith was attending BC on a football scholarship.</p>
<p><strong>My take</strong>: Well, first of all, Smith has not been tried, so in the good old US of A, he is innocent until proven guilty. However, for the sake of this post I&#8217;m going to assume he&#8217;s guilty anyway. I&#8217;m not even going to bother mentioning the fact that sexual assault is bad and disgusting. I&#8217;ll just assume everyone reading this already knows that and agrees. The one thing I can say is that I really hate people like this. I know a lot of really smart people who applied to BC, but didn&#8217;t get in. I know others who did get in, but couldn&#8217;t go because they couldn&#8217;t afford it. It makes me so mad that someone like this is taking the place of smart, productive, non-criminals. I just hope that the same people who handed him a scholarship don&#8217;t hand him a verdict of not guilty.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apparently the <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2008/01/15/congress-after-miguel-tejada-and-steroids/">Mitchell Report</a> was just the tip of the iceberg for Miguel Tejada. According to <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3351418">ESPN.com</a>, Houston Astros&#8217; shortstop Miguel Tejada lied about his age when he signed with the Oakland Athletics in 1993. Following the advice of a local coach, he said he was 17 years old when he signed, even though he was actually 19. However, his green card, driver&#8217;s license and other legal United States documents show his real birthday. He insists that he did not mean to do anything wrong, but thought it was his only way to sign a professional contract.</p>
<p><strong>My Take:</strong> There is so much wrong with his story. First of all, I know 1993 was a very long time ago (but not really since that was the year my car was made and it&#8217;s still kickin!) but didn&#8217;t we have rules about checking legal documents before signing players back then? How does this process work? Last time I checked this was Major League Baseball and not key club (high school organization that everyone joins because it looks good on college applications). I&#8217;m seriously considering lying about my gender so I can join. Why not? The second main problem is that he insists he didn&#8217;t think he was doing anything wrong. I know ethics and morality have gray areas, but I think everyone can agree that lying is wrong. Apparently Tejada doesn&#8217;t believe in simple morals since now he&#8217;s lying about his attentions. At least Boston fans have something to take the attention off of Spygate.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2 Outfield Tickets&#8230; $60<br />
Favorite player&#8217;s t-shirt&#8230; $25<br />
&#8220;Official MLB&#8221; hat&#8230; $30<br />
Being a fan&#8230; NOT PRICELESS</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right. &#8220;Red Sox Nation&#8221; is no longer a general term for all Red Sox fans. No, now we need to make it official by spending an additional $15-250. This has been going on for a few years and it just keeps getting more ridiculous. Being a fan and consumerism are not the same thing. Being an &#8220;official&#8221; member of Red Sox Nation is meaningless. No, that&#8217;s not entirely true. It means you have more money than me. Congratulations.</p>
<p>The way I see it, loving the Red Sox is sort of like loving coffee. You can brew your coffee at home where nobody sees it and still love it more than someone who goes to Starbucks just to be seen drinking it. In terms of the Red Sox, you don&#8217;t need to buy the most expensive merchandise (or any for that matter) or belong to a special club. You know if you are a fan and you shouldn&#8217;t have to prove it. Anyone who tells you anything different is wrong.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Breaking News: Randy Moss is innocent!</p>
<p>From Spygate to Tom Brady&#8217;s baby mama drama, the Patriots have been the center of many stories in 2007-08. This was probably the reason Rachelle Washington decided to come forward with allegations that Randy Moss hit her and prevented her from seeking treatment in her home on January 6, 2008. Whether we believed her or not, I think it&#8217;s safe to say that the general feeling was that she was just after a portion of Moss&#8217; fame and fortune. I was anything but surprised when <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3288150">ESPN.com reported today</a> that Ms. Washington requested that the restraining order be dropped and the entire case dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>My take:</strong> Is Randy Moss really innocent? Perhaps. Did he just pay her off so she&#8217;d drop the case? I hope not, but maybe. Did Rachelle just realize that her allegations didn&#8217;t have the impact she&#8217;d hope for? Probably. What it comes down to is that I really don&#8217;t care. I like Randy Moss because he catches the football, not because he doesn&#8217;t hit women. All I can say is, Randy Moss, for the sake of your fans, your team, and your sanity, please stay away from this crazy woman.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Breaking news! According to <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2008/02/29/2008-02-29_side_dish_tom_brady_in_his_underwear.html">NYdailynews.com</a>, Patriots QB Tom Brady has been offered seven figures to star in a new underwear campaign for Calvin Klein. This move was designed to compete with Armani&#8217;s ads staring L.A. Galaxy&#8217;s David Beckham.</p>
<p><strong>My take:</strong> As long as this doesn&#8217;t deter his focus from football, I don&#8217;t see any reason why he shouldn&#8217;t do it. It&#8217;s no secret that Tom Brady is young and gorgeous, and he won&#8217;t stay that way forever. While some might consider him a sellout, I think he should cash out while he still can. Plus, what girl doesn&#8217;t want to see Tom Brady in his underwear? I am so glad that this deal got offered to Tom and not Peyton.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am a girl. I love sports. I don&#8217;t see why these two things cannot go hand in hand. My mom, aunt, and sister are all huge sports fans. I grew up watching the Red Sox, Patriots, and Celtics. When the Sports of Boston guys decided to add a female voice to this blog, I jumped at the chance.</p>
<p>I find it necessary to explain the term &#8220;pink hat&#8221; for anyone who doesn&#8217;t understand the title of this column. According to KC, a &#8220;pink hat&#8221; is a girl who is not a sports fan that moves here for college and buys a pink hat because it is cute. I own pink hats, jerseys, and accessories, but I don&#8217;t fit this definition. The way I see it is, if I can mix my favorite color and my favorite sports teams, why wouldn&#8217;t I?</p>
<p>I will mostly only talk about baseball and football, because these are the only sports I watch consistently. I watch basketball occasionally, but I don&#8217;t even think I could name the Celtics starting lineup. The only thing I know about the Celts is that I hate Paul Pierce and I always have. I go to UMass hockey games so I can chant obscenities and taunt the goalie, but I have no idea what&#8217;s going on. As much as I hate to admit it, I cannot remember the last time I watched a Bruins game. I also just drafted my very first fantasy baseball team! I have no idea what I am doing, but I will post more about my trials, tribulations, frustrations, and utter confusion later.</p>
