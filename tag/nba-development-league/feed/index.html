				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Celtics assigned the recently acquired Marcus Landry to the Maine Red Claws on Saturday, presumably to make room for veteran sharpshooter Michael Finley. Landry came to the Celtics on Deadline Day with Nate Robinson for Eddie House, J.R. Giddens, and Bill Walker.</p>
<p>Landry got in one game with the Celtics this season, playing three minutes against the Cavs in the 108-88 loss. He went 0/2 from downtown and did not register a stat.</p>
<p>More from the NBA D-League&#8217;s press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>NEW YORK, March 6, 2010 – Boston Celtics rookie forward Marcus Landry was assigned to the Maine Red Claws, the Celtics’ NBA D-League affiliate, it was announced today.  Landry’s assignment is the 28th of the 2009-10 NBA D-League season.</p>
<p>Landry, 6-7, 230-pounds, has appeared in one game for Boston since being acquired by the Celtics on Feb. 18 in a trade with the New York Knicks.  In 18 career NBA games, Landry averaged 2.4 points and 6.2 minutes, scoring a career-high eight points in a 132-89 win over the Indiana Pacers on Jan. 3 at Madison Square Garden. (...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/03/06/celtics-assign-landry-to-red-claws/">Celtics Assign Landry to Red Claws</a> (239 words)</p>

<p>Almond leads the D-League with 26.8 points per game in 22 games this season. The former 2007 first round pick (No. 26, Utah Jazz) is the all-time leading scorer for Rice. A veteran of 34 NBA games, Almond played in the 2010 D-League All-Star Game.</p>
<h2>TJ Cummings</h2>
<p>Cummings, at 28, has played parts of five seasons in the D-League and across the globe in Puerto Rico, China, Belgium, etc. He brings the Claws a nice presence on the boards, as he&#8217;s averaging 15.5 points and 8.9 rebounds per game.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/02/16/maine-red-claws-trade-for-almond-cummings/">Maine Red Claws Trade For Almond, Cummings</a> (91 words)</p>

Giddens and future considerations to the New York Knicks for Nate Robinson during a 14-game stretch in December when Robinson didn&#8217;t see any action.</p>
<p>Then, when Robinson exploded for 41 points in a win over the Hawks on Jan. 1, the trade landscape changed and Robinson&#8217;s value increased.</p>
<p>In a busy day for J.R. Giddens news, the second-year player was sent to the Red Claws on Thursday, an indication that Kevin Garnett may soon be returning to the lineup. Giddens provided the Celtics their only &#8220;true&#8221; backup point guard, but for now, he&#8217;s headed to Maine to help out the Claws.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the full press release from the NBA D-League:</p>
<blockquote><p>NEW YORK, Jan. 21, 2010 – Boston Celtics guard J.R. Giddens was assigned to the Maine Red Claws, Boston’s NBA D-League affiliate, it was announced today.  Giddens is the 12th NBA player, and the third Celtic, to be assigned to an NBA D-League affiliate this season.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/01/21/j-r-giddens-offered-to-knicks-for-nate-robinson-assigned-to-red-claws/">J.R.

<h3>SIOUX FALLS DOWNS MAINE AT 2010 NBA D-LEAGUE SHOWCASE</h3>
<p>BOISE, ID Jan. 5, 2010 – Playing its third game in four days, the Sioux Falls Skyforce had enough in the tank to snap a three-game losing streak, defeating the Maine Red Claws 121–102 in the fifth game of the 2010 NBA D-League Showcase.</p>
<p>All seven players who took the court for Sioux Falls scored in double figures, led by 20 points from David Bailey.

Raymond Sykes and Chris McCray each added 19 points for the Skyforce.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/01/05/red-claws-split-2-games-at-2010-nba-d-league-showcase/">Red Claws Split 2 Games at 2010 NBA D-League Showcase</a> (444 words)</p>

<p>&#8220;We just executed both on the defense and the offensive end,&#8221; Georgia Tech alum Mario West (team-high 19 points) said. &#8220;Anytime you can get stops and fast breaks and layups and get points on the other end, that helps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When we got defensive stops we pulled ahead,&#8221; head coach Austin Ainge said. &#8220;And every time our defense lapsed they got back in the game. We can score, we have a lot of talented players so we&#8217;ll always be able score the ball so it&#8217;s about getting defensive stops when we need to.&#8221;<br />
