The event took place just prior to the Red Sox facing the Chicago White Sox.</p>
<p>The recent Hall of Fame Inductee was honored at the ballpark and fans were given a miniature Hall of Fame plaque detailing some of his career statistics as well as player history. During the event a video highlight was shown on the jumbotron giving fans, players, and coaches a chance to admire Pedro&#8217;s supremacy on the mound and his charisma in the dugout and clubhouse. The video also featured Martinez career stats, which got the crowd roaring before he even took the field. So many of the numbers are staggering however a few that got a rise out of those spectating included the following: The 313 strikeouts in 1999, which was Pedro&#8217;s single-season career-high and a Sox franchise record. His 1.74 ERA in 2000, which was ridiculous, keeping in mind the juiced-up players he was fanning on a nightly basis. Then, last but not least, the .760 winning percentage (117-37) with the Red Sox between 1998-2004, best in the majors in that time span.</p>
<p>Martinez, accompanied by his wife and children, waited excitedly as Red Sox legends came out to congratulate him on his accomplishments. It all started with a video message from Nomar Garciaparra, who recalled being inducted into the Latino Hall of Fame with Martinez, he was asked to use two words to describe the sensational ace and said, &#8216;The Best,&#8221; which may simply be the most accurate description.</p>
<p>The ceremony was led by the voice of the Red Sox, Joe Castiglione, who called on Sox greats such as Carl Yastrzemski, Jim Rice, Dwight Evans, Dennis Eckersley, and Carlton Fisk to present Pedro with gifts and memorabilia. One unique gift was a bronze mold, covered in gold, of Pedro&#8217;s huge hands and freakishly long fingers. It was, after all, these fingers that allowed him to force righties out of the batters box, waving at that up and in, high-rising fastball and then make most who faced him look foolish with a one of a kind change up. Martinez was also presented with a laptop computer full of video highlights of his career from teammates Curt Schilling, Trot Nixon and Orlando Cabrera. A special thank you and a call to review &#8216;El Tiante&#8217; Luis Tiant all-time numbers for further accolades was made by Pedro during his speech. He also thanked former Expos manager Felipe Alou as well as Ralph Avila, the scout who first discovered Martinez at a young age in the Dominican Republic. Sox favorite Tim Wakefield made an appearance and presented the Martinez family with a donation to his charity. Pedro also took time for heartfelt gratitude aimed at all the fans in Red Sox Nation.</p>
<p>It was David Ortiz that set in motion the unveiling of #45, which will now forever be a part of Fenway Park and the Red Sox organization and never again be worn by a Sox player. Ortiz spoke to the Fenway Faithful to address Pedro&#8217;s amazing career but also his genuine personality that New England came to fall in love with during his time in Boston.</p>
<p>Before Martinez could finish his speech, he brought out his catcher Jason Varitek to share the moment with him calling it &#8220;his moment, too.&#8221; This was apparently off script as Varitek was to come out for the first pitch, to this Martinez said, &#8220;Hey, this is Pedro,&#8221; and, much to the delight of the crowd, referred to the celebration as &#8220;my party.&#8221; The Hall of Fame pitcher took the mound for the final time in front of a standing ovation as he threw out the first pitch, high and tight of course, to his battery-mate Varitek.</p>
<p>In Pedro&#8217;s career he was voted onto eight All-Star teams, and won three Cy Young Awards while piling up 3,154 strikeouts, 219 wins, and a 2.93 career ERA. Pedro recently received 91.1 percent of the vote to be inducted into the Hall of Fame, joining this years class of baseball legends. Whether it was blowing away the side or taping a player to a post in the dugout, Martinez was as integral a part of the Red Sox as there was at the turn of the millennium. Pedro dazzled all those who watched him with his electric fastball, majestic change-up and infectious smile. His dominance as a pitcher and his leadership in the clubhouse helped Boston reverse the curse and win the 2004 World Series. Pedro&#8217;s role on that team, and the greatness of his Red Sox career will never be forgotten, and now remembering is just as easy as turning your head toward right field.</p>

<p>Despite all the money he made, despite all the accolades he received, Nomar&#8217;s career, to me, and I think I speak for all Sox fans in this regard, will be recognized more for what it could have been, than what it was.</p>
<p>There was a time in which Nomar could accurately be described as a more complete player than Derek Jeter.  Of course, at that time, Alex Rodriguez was the best player in baseball (and would be for the next several years) but, between the three of them, they made baseball the best sport in America. In 2014, where the disparity in popularity between baseball and football grows every year, there appears to be something missing from the game that made it the favorite from Generation X to every generation dating back to the Civil War.  Each season, there seemed to be a single compelling narrative which captured the country&#8217;s fascination.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2014/10/05/as-jeter-leaves-lets-reminisce-on-nomar-what-could-have-been/">As Jeter Leaves, Let&#8217;s Reminisce on Nomar: What Could Have Been</a> (718 words)</p>

Joe Castiglione has been calling Red Sox games on the radio for over 30 years now and is a deserving inductee. Then, there is Roger Clemens.

It looked like the Player’s Union would scrap the deal because Rodriguez had to alter his contract to come to Boston, but ultimately the deal was approved. In exchange for Rodriguez, the Red Sox sent the talented but enigmatic slugger Manny Ramirez to the Rangers, as well as, little known Single A pitcher Jon Lester. To replace Ramirez, the Red Sox ship now displaced shortstop Nomar Garciaparra to the White Sox for Magglio Ordonez and pitcher Brandon McCarthy.</p>
<p>It’s amazing how so often the best deals are the ones that do not happen. The previous scenario obviously did not pan out, but it very nearly did. Where would the Red Sox be standing now in this alternate history? They would be short three championships to start.

<p>The Sox have inquired on several pitchers, but the latest one that has been brought up is Cliff Lee. Lee would be a huge boost in the rotation and would provide substantial depth.

(Photo Courtesy Elsa/Getty Images) " ></a><p>If you asked me if this team could sink any lower a week ago, I would have responded with &#8220;how could that happen?&#8221; It&#8217;s no secret the 2012 campaign has been a dark cloud on the franchise&#8217;s history. There have been plenty of reasons to dislike this team ever since September of last season. Yet with all the baggage they have and all the negativity that surrounds them, I thought there was literally no way they could sink any lower.</p>
<p>Until I read <a href="http://bostonherald.com/track/inside_track/view.bg?articleid=1061155131&amp;position=0">this story in the Boston Herald</a>.</p>
<p>All but four of the Red Sox players skipped out on Johnny Pesky&#8217;s funeral. They did manage to attend Josh Beckett&#8217;s annual &#8220;Beckett Bowl,&#8221; however. Instead of honoring a legend who gave so much of his life to the franchise and the game, they bowled, listened to country music, and knowing this group I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they indulged in some alcoholic beverages. Disrespectful is an understatement.</p>
<p>The four players who attended the funeral were Clay Buchholz, David Ortiz, Vincente Padilla, and Jarrod Saltalamacchia. I can understand the concept that some players may not have been that close to Pesky, which is why they may not have attended. But at the same time guys like Saltalamacchia and especially Padilla who have not been with the team long, still made the effort to honor a legend of the franchise which they are a part of. (...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2012/08/23/sox-players-skip-peskys-funeral-sink-lower/">Sox Players Skip Pesky&#8217;s Funeral, Sink Lower in Fans&#8217; Esteem</a> (261 words)</p>

<p>Nomar joined ESPN last season as an analyst for Baseball Tonight, and even called a couple of games during the season. Despite his shy nature, Nomar has grown more comfortable on camera and should fit in right away.</p>
<p>In eight seasons in Boston, Nomar hit .323/.370/.555 with 173 homers and 669 runs batted in before being traded to the Chicago Cubs during the 2004 season. He played five more injury plagued seasons with the Cubs, Dodgers and A&#8217;s before retiring after the 2009 season.</p>

<p>Tuesday at the Garden, the NBA kicked off their regular season by debuting the Miami Heat’s “new big 3,” led by former Cavalier, LeBron James. LBJ “took his talents to South Beach” over the summer, announcing the move in a self-promoting, ego-boosting, hour-long “LeBron-a-thon,” aired on ESPN. Since then, “King James” has taken loads of heat for it, and not just from scorned Cavs fans.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/10/29/who-makes-up-your-mt-rushmore-of-hatred/">Who Makes Up Your &#8220;Mt.

The move comes as little surprise after Garciaparra effectively ended his career with the Red Sox, signing a ceremonial one day contract to retire with the team on March 10. That day, he also threw out the first pitch in a Grapefruit League game in Fort Myers. On Wednesday he will be saying goodbye to the game once more on a far bigger stage in front of many more fans.</p>
<h2>The Early Years</h2>
<p>While Garciaparra will be received with reverence and ovation, his relationship with Red Sox faithful hasn&#8217;t always been so secure. Though he picked up where Mo Vaughn left off and prepared us for Pedro, Garciaparra&#8217;s final season in Boston was nothing if not strange.
