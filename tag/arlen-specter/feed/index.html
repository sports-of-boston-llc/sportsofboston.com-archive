				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After all the talk about Congressional hearings, subpoenas and sworn testimony, it appears &#8220;Spygate&#8221; will not be uttered in the hallowed halls in Washington D.C.. After months of threatening an official investigation into the NFL&#8217;s handling of Spygate, Pennsylvania senator Arlen Specter has said he will not be pursuing any such investigation because he &#8220;doesn&#8217;t have the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Daily News broke the story which had Specter quoted saying, &#8220;I&#8217;ve gone as far as I can&#8221; and says Specter will now focus on another sports topic &#8211; the public financing of stadiums. Specter also said he wouldn&#8217;t be pursuing an investigation because he has &#8220;too much to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>No comment has been released as of yet from the NFL or the Patriots.</p>
<p><strong>My Take:</strong> What a windbag. After all he puts the league and the Patriots through, he does what everyone knew would happen, drop the matter. Specter had zero support in Congress for a full investigation and even Patriots haters across the country wondered why with all the problems facing the country that Specter would waste time on this. This should finally bring a close to Spygate forever as all rocks seemed to have been overturned. Specter proved how stupid he is and how much he just wanted the limelight and now he&#8217;ll focus on other things not related to our economy, the war on terror and health care. Good job Pennsylvania!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to the AP,<strong> Sen. Arlen Specter</strong> wants an independent investigation of the Patriots&#8217; taping of opposing coaches&#8217; signals similar to the Mitchell Report on performance enhancing drugs in baseball. Specter again criticized the league&#8217;s handling of the investigation during a news conference Wednesday. Specter is the senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong>OK. I&#8217;ve had enough of this national attention to the issue. Allow me to give some local attention. Here are the facts that were presented to NFL Commissioner <strong>Roger Goodell</strong> by <strong>Bill Belichick</strong> and reaffirmed by <strong>Matt Walsh</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Patriots illegally taped opposing offensive and defensive signals from the sidelines ever since Bill Belichick became coach in 2000.</li>
<li>The Patriots did not tape or authorize a taping of the St. Louis Rams&#8217; walkthrough prior to the 2002 Super Bowl.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaking in Washington with Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA), NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said Wednesday that he stands behind destroying the Patriots spying tapes after viewing and punishing the three time Super Bowl Champions.</p>
<p>Specter says Goodell told him that the Patriots admitted to taping opposing coaches signals since Bill Belichick took over in 2000. Specter said Goodell had told him Belichick said he thought the taping was legal but Goodell didn&#8217;t agree.</p>
<p>Specter wanted to speak to Goodell because he feels the entire process of hearing the claims, seeing the tapes, punishing the Pats and destroying the tapes all took place in a two week span, and though he won&#8217;t come out and say there was a cover-up, he&#8217;s intreagued by &#8220;the amount of haste&#8221; in which the events took place.</p>
<p><strong>My Take:</strong> I think the most important thing to come out of the meeting is the Belichick admission of taping coaches since 2000. Whether or not he really thought it was legal, this might open another whole can of worms. As for the story as a whole, I think Specter has a right to talk to Goodell because the NFL enjoys an anti-trust exemption and if the league front office can&#8217;t be trusted then they should lose that privilege. However, I agree with Goodell&#8217;s actions in destroying the tapes. Why would he keep them around? So they could be leaked to the media? There is no reason not to destroy the tapes as soon as they were received.</p>
