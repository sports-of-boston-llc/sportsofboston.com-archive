In the world of Boston sports, there may not be a man more deserving of this honor than Celtic great Bill Russell. In May it was announced that Russell, a winner of 11 NBA championships, would finally be honored with a statue in city where he won all those titles. Now the location of the statue has finally been determined.</p>
<p>Next spring, the statue will stand on the south side of City Hall Plaza in an open, bricked area. The chosen location is meant to be a reflection Russell’s outstanding work on and off the floor of the hardwood. Russell was not only one of the greatest players in NBA history, but was also a civil rights activist. He has also been a supporter of children and education. He currently is a part of a state-mentoring organization called the Mass Mentoring Project that has helped more than 23,000 students as well.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2011/07/14/bill-russells-statue-to-stand-in-city-hall-plaza/">Bill Russell&#8217;s Statue To Stand In City Hall Plaza</a> (337 words)</p>

As most Bostonians would agree, it’s about time.</p>
<p>Russell is considered one of the greatest athletes to play professional sports in North America, having won 11 Championships with the Boston Celtics, three of which while he was a player coach. He also happened to be the first black coach in a major U.S. professional sports league, and was honored in February with the Presidential Medal of Honor.</p>
<p>It is well known that Russell struggled with racism in Boston, and fled the city after his playing days. He famously refused to return when the Celtics retired his number 6, and when he was inducted into the Hall of Fame. But he has in recent years made amends with city, beginning with a re-retirement of his number in the new Fleet Center in 1999, in which the standing ovation from the crowd <a title="New York Times" href="http://partners.nytimes.com/library/sports/basketball/061600bkn-russell.html" target="_blank">brought tears to his eyes</a>. Since then he has begun to return more often to Boston, reaching out to the youth and even mentoring current Celtics’ legends such as Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2011/05/05/bill-russell-to-be-honored-with-statue-in-boston/">Bill Russell to be Honored with Statue in Boston</a> (308 words)</p>
