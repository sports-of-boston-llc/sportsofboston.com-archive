				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>They worked all season to get to this point. Now, the New England Patriots will have to best a perennial defensive power house in the Baltimore Ravens. It is one of the four rematches from the regular season being played this weekend. The Patriots will hope for a repeat of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/10/04/patriots-outlast-ravens-27-21/">the 27-21 win during Week 4</a>.  Since then, the Ravens have been playing stellar football and hope to spoil New England&#8217;s future playoff plans.</p>
<h2>HOW THEY GOT HERE:</h2>
<p>New England has had a roller coaster season. Half of New England&#8217;s games this season have been decided by a touchdown, including five of their losses. However, they persevered and outlasted the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets to capture the AFC East. Last season, they were 11-5 and missed the playoffs. This season, 10-6 was enough to win the division and earn a home playoff game. The Patriots now welcome the Ravens to Foxboro, a team they are 5-0 against all time.</p>
<p>Baltimore surprised the world last season when they went all the way to the AFC Championship, led by a rookie coach (John Harbaugh) and quarterback (Joe Flacco). They wasted little time this year, starting 3-0 until they ran into the Patriots. Their schedule was a mix of top teams (Colts and Vikings) and bottom dwellers (Browns and Lions), and they finished with a 9-7 record, second in their division to the Bengals. As a wild card team last season, they had no struggles on the road and they are looking to repeat in the new decade.</p>
<h2>WHY NEW ENGLAND WILL WIN:</h2>
<p>There are certain teams that New England does not lose to and one of them is the Ravens. Since the Browns became the Ravens in 1996, the Patriots have gone 5-0 against the birds. However, this will be a first-time matchup in the playoffs. Still, how much of a difference will this game be from the Week 4 tilt? In that matchup, Mark Clayton dropped a would-be first down pass that would have kept a potential game-winning drive alive for the Ravens. It was a game New England should have lost, (their top receiver was Ben Watson with 51 yards and they had no rusher over 25 yards), but in the end, they prevailed. In the end, it&#8217;s not how you win, but that you win.</p>
<p>So, the simple fact that New England has Tom Brady at the helm should be enough. Even <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/01/09/the-playoffs-without-wes-welker/">with Wes Welker down</a>, Brady&#8217;s weapons of Randy Moss, Ben Watson, Julian Edelman, and Kevin Faulk will allow him to spread the ball around and keep New England rolling.</p>
<p>This game also sees the return of Vince Wilfork. The big man on defense will eliminate any holes for Baltimore&#8217;s Ray Rice or Willis McGahee. The Ravens runners are north-to-south guys who run right down the middle and by shutting them down, New England will ruin Baltimore&#8217;s offense. With a quarterback who can control the clock and a defense that can make the other team continue to punt, there is no doubt that the Patriots will win the game.</p>
<h2>WHY BALTIMORE WILL WIN:</h2>
<p>New England might have been team of the decade, but Baltimore was the defense of the decade. They have had the most feared linebacker in recent memory, Ray Lewis. Their secondary is manned by Ed Reed, a man who has a better nose for the ball than most receivers. So, there is a reason why they should be angry. The only talk about defense is how the New York Jets have the best in the league, by far. If that isn&#8217;t enough to get a team fired up, then nothing is. The Ravens have six guys who have two or more interceptions on the season. Ray Lewis is fifth in the league in tackles and leads a pass rush that has collected 32 sacks on the season.</p>
<p>On the other side of the ball, the Ravens have a duel run threat with Ray Rice and Willis McGahee and a quarterback that doesn&#8217;t make many mistakes. No experts out of Baltimore are picking the Ravens to win, which does create an &#8220;us against the world&#8221; mentality. This game will be a statement game for the Ravens, proving they still have a great defense and that last season&#8217;s AFC Championship appearance was no fluke.</p>
<h2>THE X-FACTOR:</h2>
<p>Who will win the wide receiver battle? Derrick Mason was the Ravens leader in receiving yards with 1,028, but Ray Rice was first in receptions with 78 and the team&#8217;s second leading receiver. Todd Heap, Mark Clayton and Kelley Washington have not been the models of perfection. They also are not sure things for Joe Flacco. If New England shuts the running game down, every member of the Ravens receiving corp will have to step up their game, or they will have an early exit from the playoffs.</p>
<p>When you talk about receivers in New England, all talk goes to the loss of Wes Welker. He is done for a while and Randy Moss appears to be injured as well. That leaves Ben Watson as the teams next leading receiver with 404 yards. Moss will be active for the team and hopefully his injury is one of Bill Belichick&#8217;s mind tricks. Edelman and Sam Aiken will see a lot of playing time and Kevin Faulk will see many passes going his way when he&#8217;s in the game.</p>
<p>Not-So-Fun-Fact: Super Bowl XLII hero David Tyree, yes the &#8220;helmet catch guy,&#8221; now plays for the Ravens and is fourth on their depth chart. Do not be surprised if he makes an appearance, if only to be used as a distraction.</p>
<h2>PREDICTION:</h2>
<p>This could be the closest game played during Wild Card Weekend. If New England can not control the Ravens run game, there is no chance they will win. The last time around, the Patriots did not allow a rushing touchdown. If they can repeat that success, then New England advancing in the playoffs is a sure thing. The loss of Wes Welker will be felt this week, but if there was one person who could over come that obstacle, it&#8217;s Tom Brady. The Ravens will throw everything, including the kitchen sink, at the Patriots, but trust in Belichick. He lives for these games. <strong>Patriots 27 &#8211; Ravens 20</strong>.</p>

<p>Leagues with a Week 17 championship game can be a pain in the butt. This is the time of the season where most teams have clinched playoff spots and will be methodically resting starters in order to hopefully prevent injury. In fantasy land, this makes deciding who to start or who to pick up extremely difficult. But hey, I guess that is the challenge of a Week 17 championship.</p>
<h2>Week 17 Sleepers</h2>
<h3>Indianapolis @ Buffalo</h3>
<h4>Buffalo Bills Defense/Special Teams</h4>
<p>The Colts showed last week that they aren&#8217;t afraid to rest key players. They even ruined a perfect season to do it. There is no reason to think Indy won&#8217;t rest Peyton Manning and Co. again this week, maybe even more.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/12/30/week-17-sleepers/">Week 17 Sleepers</a> (736 words)</p>

I mentioned <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/10/24/week-7-start-em-sit-em/">last week</a> how owners should get creative when dealing with their bye weeks. I shared with you how I coped with a tough Week 4 by making two trades that value-wise weren’t in my favor, but allowed me to upgrade my starting lineup &#8211; or so I thought. Let’s look at the three trades I’ve made in this league:</p>
<ul>
<li> In Week 3 I traded Cedric Benson and Derrick Mason for Clinton Portis and Calvin Johnson.</li>
<li> In Week 4 I traded Thomas Jones, Marshawn Lynch and Steve Smith (NYG) for Matt Forte and Percy Harvin.</li>
<li> In Week 4 I traded Mike  Bell and Correll Buckhalter for Donald Brown.</li>
</ul>
<p>My starting lineup after these trades was Donovan McNabb, LaDanian Tomlinson, Matt Forte, Clinton Portis, Calvin Johnson, Steve Smith (CAR), Brent Celek, Indianapolis D/ST and a kicker. I was feeling pretty good about my team and thought that I was the team to beat in this 12-team league. Think about that for a second. In a 12-team league I had acquired <em>three</em> first round players. However, if you reevaluate the trades now it appears I not only gave up more value, but <em>downgraded</em> my starters in the process!(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/10/30/week-8-start-em-sit-em/">Week 8: Start &#8216;Em/Sit &#8216;Em</a> (1,724 words)</p>

<p>Over the years, I have learned that you do not win fantasy football leagues by holding onto big names waiting for them to start producing for you. I have found out that you have to make as little of an emotional connection to your roster as possible. You can’t be afraid to drop players like Terrell Owens and Derrick Ward for guys like Mike Sims-Walker and Ricky Williams because believe it or not, the owner who owns the latter pair is feeling a lot better about his team than the other guy.</p>
<p>So I am here to tell you it’s OK to drop big name guys who aren’t producing because if they haven’t done anything positive five weeks into the season, then what can you expect going forward? Obviously I am not talking about players that have been underachieving due to injury because clearly they can come back and contribute positively to your team. I am talking about these guys, who I think are the biggest names that you should feel free to drop at this point in the season:</p>
<p>Terrell Owens, Lee Evans, LenDale White, Darren McFadden, Derrick Ward, Laveranues Coles and Torry Holt- see you guys next year.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/10/16/week-6-start-em-sit-em/">Week 6: Start &#8216;Em/Sit &#8216;Em</a> (1,477 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Baltimore Ravens (3-0) at New England Patriots (2-1)</h2>
<p><strong>Time</strong>: 1:00 p.m.<br />
<strong>Where</strong>: Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Massachusetts<br />
<strong>TV</strong>: CBS<br />
<strong>Radio</strong>: 98.5 FM:  The Sports Hub</p>
<p>The New England Patriots are entering Week 4 with a respectable 2-1 record and are gearing up to play one of the most potent offenses in the NFL&#8230;wait&#8230;the Baltimore Ravens?</p>
<p>No longer just a defensive team, the Ravens have finally added an offense that makes them a serious Super Bowl contender.  They have maturity on both sides of the ball and are 11-1 in their last 12 games, including the preseason.  Since becoming the Ravens (remember they were once the original Cleveland Browns), the franchise is winless against the Patriots and has scored a combined six points at games in New England.  To quote the Ravens, they hope this happens &#8220;Never More.&#8221;(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/10/04/patriots-meet-new-and-improved-ravens-offense/">Patriots Meet New And Improved Ravens Offense</a> (1,479 words)</p>

For the football season I will be recommending players to start and sit at each position for the upcoming week. I will avoid recommending the obvious names such as, Adrian Peterson, Drew Brees or Tom Brady who you start no matter what team they are facing. I will focus more on the middle-of-the-road players. The ones who you need to decide between that can make or break your week. I can promise you that it is much more useful to research a decision between Jerricho Cotchery and Derrick Mason rather than Drew Brees and Joe Flacco. So without further delay, let’s jump right into it!</p>
<h2>Quarterbacks</h2>
<h3>Start ‘Em</h3>
<h4>David Garrard, QB, Jacksonville (vs. ARI)</h4>
<p>I know he looked awful against the Colts on Sunday, but that defense is better than people give them credit. Garrard faces a much weaker defense in Arizona and it’s a home game so I see a nice game out of Garrard here. I am one of those who think Torry Holt still has some juice left and Garrard will squeeze it out of him and make a fantasy drink. That makes no sense.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/09/17/week-2-start-emsit-em/">Week 2: Start &#8216;Em/Sit &#8216;Em</a> (1,175 words)</p>
