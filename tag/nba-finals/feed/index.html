<p>After the Cavs were blown off the floor in game four, I along with the rest of the country had pronounced them dead. I had begun to write LeBron&#8217;s eulogy, complete with a bevy of excuses and narcissistic one-liners that he would have loved. I popped &#8220;The Godfather&#8221; in the DVD player and was prepared to watch it six times in succession as a tribute to LBJ&#8217;s willpower and mental fortitude. I even sent flowers to LeBron&#8217;s mom and step-dad, Delonte West.</p>
<p>The series was all but over. You could see it in the body language of every Cavs player. They were ready to throw in the towel and fire up the old LeBron excuse train. But then, the King finally lived up to his name. Kyrie got the party started with a tremendous individual performance in game five, and LeBron finally woke up and remembered that he is the single most unguardable player in the history of basketball.</p>
<p>No one, not even Air Jordan himself, has ever had a performance quite like King James had in these finals. I mean the guy led both teams in points, assists, rebounds, steals, and blocks for the series for christ&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>He carried the Cavs and the city of Cleveland to their first title in 52 years, and he did it against a team that was destined to be one of, if not thee greatest team of all-time. Of course, the epic comeback would not have been possible without one of the biggest collapses in the history of modern athletics. The Warriors were completely out of sync down the stretch last night, hoisting up horrible shots and hoping that Steph or Klay (The Trash Bros) would bail them out with a late prayer. Their third best player in Draymond Green outplayed both Steph and Klay for most of the series, and that can&#8217;t be the case if you want to beat a player of Bron Bron&#8217;s caliber on the big stage.</p>
<p>As much as I hate to say it, if LeBron cracked under pressure like Steph did in this series, the media would be absolutely DESTROYING him right now. That&#8217;s the price you pay when you build yourself up as one of the biggest front runners of all-time. When you lose, the blame falls squarely on your broad, freakishly muscular shoulders. But when you win, and dominate the way that LeBron did in this series, then all of the praise and credit if yours and yours alone.</p>
<p>Whatever narrative you want to write about LeBron and his career is now open for debate. The comparisons between he and Jordan that seemed all but dead just a few short months ago are now back on the table. That&#8217;s how impressive LBJ&#8217;s finals were.</p>
<p>So where does LeBron go from here? He did what he set out to do and won a championship for his city, and he did so as the best player on the floor by  wide, wide margin. Why stay? Cleveland is a dump to begin with and I&#8217;ve got to imagine that it&#8217;s burned to the ground after last night&#8217;s celebrations. Whatever he does, his legacy is now set in stone.</p>
<p>I hate you LeBron James, and I always will. Your pompous, self-absorbed demeanor will never allow me to truly respect your greatness. But finally, I can say without sarcasm, that I truly, truly respect you.</p>
<p>PS- Someone check on J.R. Smith. Like right now.</p>

I don&#8217;t think anyone, including the Warriors, thought that OKC would put up this kind of a fight against the defending world champs. Up three games to one, the Thunder were in the driver&#8217;s seat. Russell Westbrook couldn&#8217;t be stopped and was looking like the best player on the court. Kevin Durant was playing sound, efficient basketball on both ends of the floor, and the supporting cast, particularly Steven Adams, seemed to be making all the little plays that make the difference in a tight series.</p>
<p>But then, Steph Curry happened. Klay Thompson woke up from his coma and dropped 19 in the fourth quarter to force game seven. When you get a great team like the Warriors on their heels, you have to go for the jugular. Can&#8217;t let Steph and Klay hang around long enough to get hot. The role players, including Anderson Varejao, who apparently still plays basketball, and others did their part down the stretch. Oracle was LIT. Steph was crossing anyone who dared to guard him and making it look more effortless than ever. When I think about Steph Curry twenty years from now, this is the game I&#8217;ll remember. The way he, the Thunder, and everyone watching knew the ball was going in the second he came off of the screen.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got to be honest, I was starting to grow tired of all the Golden State love. ESPN constantly shoving them down our throats and social media losing their minds every time Steph hits a three. But the Warriors are just too much fun. One of the all-time great teams in sports and last night showed just what kind of resolve they really have. Can&#8217;t wait to watch them take down King James once again in the finals. I enjoy watching LeBron James lose just as much as I enjoy watching my teams win. If that&#8217;s wrong, then I don&#8217;t want to be right.</p>
<p>PS- Hey KD, you know who doesn&#8217;t play in the Western Conference with the big bad Warriors and Spurs? The Celtics. Just saying&#8230;</p>

<p>As painful as it was to be forced to recall that deeply suppressed memory, it made me somewhat giddy. Was I about to see Lebron go full supernova to save the Cleveland Cavaliers season and force a Game 7? Without having it come at the expense of my own team? Was anything even out of the realm of possibility?</p>
<p>When the final horn sounded, Lebron&#8217;s stat line didn&#8217;t disappoint: 36 points, 15 rebounds, 9 assists, just shy of his third triple double of the Finals. But somehow his performance still was disappointing, as the Golden State Warriors withheld a furious JR Smith heat check 3-point barrage in the final minutes to end the franchise&#8217;s 40 year title drought.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/06/17/lebron-falls-short-as-warriors-end-40-year-nba-title-drought/">Lebron Falls Short as Warriors End 40 Year NBA Title Drought</a> (618 words)</p>

<p>As a Celtics fan &#8211; one who watched his team get unceremoniously swept out of the first round by an earlier iteration of this Cleveland Cavaliers team &#8211; I can&#8217;t explain why I find myself cheering for Lebron. It is blasphemy. It is heresy. It is wrong.</p>

The Heat and Spurs are once again the last two teams standing, and will clash in the Finals for the second consecutive season. It is the first time that the same two teams will play in the Finals since 1997 and 1998, when the Chicago Bulls and Utah Jazz faced off in back-to-back years. In 2013, the Heat needed a game seven at home to capture its second straight NBA Championship. Will it be the same story in 2014?</p>
<h2>The rematch</h2>
<p>The Heat&#8217;s and Spurs&#8217; rosters are very similar to last year&#8217;s. <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/558/mike-miller">Mike Miller</a> for the Heat and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/4300/gary-neal">Gary Neal</a> for the Spurs are key players that will not be in this year’s Finals, while Miami added <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/469/rashard-lewis">Rashard Lewis</a> and San Antonio now has <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/3190/marco-belinelli">Marco Belinelli</a> in the fold. The Spurs have home court advantage this time around, but Miami has had an easier road getting to the Finals. San Antonio needed seven games just to get out of the first round against the Dallas Mavericks, and had a tough six-game series in the Western Conference Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Miami, on the other hand, has only lost three games in the playoffs. The question now is, will the Heat complete the three-peat, or will the Spurs avenge their 2013 Finals disappointment?(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2014/06/05/heat-vs-spurs-round-two/">Heat vs Spurs: Round Two</a> (145 words)</p>

Last summer Allen was given the choice between a bigger contract that came with a starting role in Boston vs heading to South Beach to play with <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james">LeBron James</a> and a chance at a ring. This past week it was made clear why Allen made this choice, with the Miami Heat beating the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA Finals in 7 games, giving them their second championship in two years. Allen did give up millions of dollars to come to Miami, but in the end Allen got what mattered to him most, a 2nd championship ring.</p>
<p>During the finals Allen was a key contributor, and shot 54 percent from three. One of those threes was arguably the most important shot in the series, a clutch corner three with just 5.2 seconds left to tie game 6 and force a overtime. The Heat would end up winning the game in overtime and go on to win the title.  Allen finished the finals with an average 10.2 points per game and is the only Connecticut Husky to have won two NBA Championship rings in the school&#8217;s history.<br />

He was born in Brooklyn, New York, to two Russian immigrants. Red also served in the U.S. Navy from 1943-47. It was not until Walter Brown, owner of the Boston Celtics, asked Red in 1950 to coach his failing and financially strapped franchise. This, arguably, could prove to be the single most important hiring in the history of Boston sports. It did not take long for Auerbach to make a impact, during the 1950 NBA draft, Auerbach drafted future Hall of Fame point guard Bob Cousy.</p>
<p>Auerbach also broke the color barrier in basketball, drafting the first African American player in Chuck Cooper. Then in 1956 NBA draft, Red drafted the single best player to ever suit up in a Celtics uniform, a man by the name of Bill Russell. Red went above and beyond to be in the position to draft this future dominant player that was said to be better than Michael Jordan by Phil Jackson, who coached Jordan to his six titles in Chicago. Thanks to Red and Russell, the Celtics created a dynasty, winning 11 titles in 13 years and becoming the most dominating team in the NBA.</p>
<p>Thanks to Red, the Celtics have won an NBA-best 17 championships, which is still a record to this day. Red was also known as one of the only coaches in the NBA who would choose players based on talent and motivation, regardless of skin color or ethnicity.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2013/06/13/remembering-celtics-legend-red-auerbach-during-the-nba-finals/">Remembering Celtics Legend Red Auerbach During the NBA Finals</a> (298 words)</p>
