With Dion Lewis and LaGarrette Blount out with season ending injuries the once dynamic combo of speed and power has been replaced by special team players and practice squad promotions. Jackson will add depth, experience, power running, ball security, and, for the Patriots, will hopefully transition to the offensive system quickly having played under offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels in 2011 in St. Louis.</p>
<p>With all the injuries the Pats have suffered Brandon Bolden, a key player in the special teams game who has always taken limited snaps at running back, has become the featured back in the New England offensive. He has been accompanied by the speedy James White who is able to play a vital role in the passing game. However with only two backs on the active roster New England was forced to promote a practice squad player for Sunday&#8217;s game against the Titans. Joey Iosefa, a 247-pound fullback who had been cut by Tampa Bay and later picked up by New England, made an impact with 51 yards on 14 carries and one big run in which he bulldozed Tennessee cornerback Coty Sensabaugh.</p>
<p>With New England so thin in the backfield, and with the playoffs and cold weather ahead, signing a veteran back like Steven Jackson looks like a solid move, although Jackson hasn&#8217;t played since being released by Atlanta in February. When in a Falcons uniform last season he averaged 3.7 yards per carry in 15 games. The three time Pro Bowler has churned out 11,388 yards over the course of 11 seasons in the NFL playing for Atlanta and St. Louis before that. Now at 32 years old the Patriots hope he has a little left in the tank to propel their running game forward. At 12-2 New England has secured a first round bye and has a great shot at the number one overall seed in the AFC. Over the next few weeks McDaniels and running back coaches will have the opportunity to work with Jackson and integrate him into the current carousel of backs.</p>
<p>If Jackson is able to get on the field quickly this would mean Bolden could get back to his special teams duties with limited touches at running back if needed. It would seem that the apparently explosive James White isn&#8217;t going anywhere as he has become a integral part of the Patriots offensive attack, particularly on passing downs. His combination of pass catching and ability to make plays when getting the ball in space gives back a little of the Dion Lewis dimension to the offensive.</p>
<p>The Patriots also recently signed running back Montee Ball to the practice squad, the Denver Broncos 2013 second round draft pick. Ball was productive in his rookie season with 120 carries for 559 yards and four touchdowns. In 2014 a groin injury sidelined him for much of the season before he was ultimately released.</p>
<p>If Jackson can get on the field this Sunday he will face a defense that is second in the NFL against the run for a better-than-expected Jets team currently fighting for a wild card spot.</p>

Phillip)" ></a><p>After losing two games in a row you knew there was no way the Patriots were going to lose Sunday against the Texans. With Belichick and Tom Brady involved the Patriots haven&#8217;t lost more than two games in a row since 2002. Offensively the team is still banged up but the return of Rob Gronkowski made an immediate impact. Julian Edelman returned to the practice field much earlier than anyone expected, granted it was light work but still a positive sight nonetheless. Both of those only added to the fact that the Bengals lost the game and Andy Dalton for potentially the rest of the season and the Broncos blew a 12-0 lead at home against the Raiders. The Patriots took the opening and now control their own destiny.</p>
<p>&#8211; Sunday night was the most balanced offensive game plan that they&#8217;ve used all year. Tom Brady finished with 30 pass attempts while the team as a whole ran the ball 31 times. They finally decided to stick with the run and it paid dividends. LeGarrette Blount looked to be having his most productive game of the season rushing 10 times for 53 yards. Unfortunately his day and season were ended early. Brandon Bolden showed a good burst for his first extended look of the season finishing with 51 yards on 16 carries. James White started to make more of an impact in the passing game gaining 27 yards on a screen pass. It&#8217;s a shame that one of the best rushing games for the year is marred by the loss of Blount.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/12/16/notes-and-observations-week-14-patriots-take-control-of-the-afc-defeat-texans-27-6/">Notes and Observations Week 14: Patriots Take Control of The AFC, Defeat Texans 27-6</a> (1,046 words)</p>

When it happens in New England it&#8217;s easy to expect doom and gloom from all the talk shows because something must be wrong, right? The good news about Sunday&#8217;s game is that it can easily be chalked up to an anomaly.</p>
<p>&#8211; Let&#8217;s start off with that absolutely stupid fake, drop kick that they made Nate Ebner attempt. I definitely understand trying to practice these trick plays in real game scenarios which is why I was 100% in agreement with the onside kick against the Redskins. Obviously it&#8217;s easy to look at the onside kick against Washington with positive eyes since the play worked. Even if that play failed they were firing with a loaded gun on offense with Julian Edelman, Danny Amendola, Rob Gronkowski, and Dion Lewis all healthy and playing. If the onside kick fails and the Redskins score, the Patriots still had their full offense to gain the points back. On Sunday they were playing without Lewis, Edelman, Gronk, and Amendola has been hobbled with a bum knee. What is the point to trying that play in that situation? The only thing it did was anger the Eagles for &#8220;disrespecting&#8221; them and it gave life to a team that was down 14-0, on the road, and has already shown a track record for giving up in the middle of games. (...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/12/09/notes-and-observations-week-13-patriots-embarrass-themselves-at-home-lose-to-eagles-35-28/">Notes and Observations Week 13: Patriots Embarrass Themselves at Home, Lose to Eagles 35-28</a> (1,026 words)</p>

With the offense devastated by injuries, the defense played some of its best football of the season. The offense is clearly dealing with communication and trust issues with all the new pieces being plugged in along the way. For the first time in weeks the offensive line was healthy but ironically it was the worst they&#8217;ve looked all year. Tom Brady&#8217;s most reliable receiver with zero dropped passes, Danny Amendola, left with an apparent knee injury. After his exit they had three healthy receivers. One was Matthew Slater and another was Chris Harper who has never caught an NFL pass. With all that they still made the plays to win a divisional game in prime time.</p>
<p>&#8211; Aside from a few big plays the defense showed again how good they can be. The front seven was holding contain on Tyrod Taylor for the majority of the game. Pressure caused by the pass rush directly led to multiple poorly thrown passes. LeSean McCoy did break the 27-yard touchdown run but was held to just 55 rushing yards other than that. By his standards that&#8217;s a relatively calm day. Rob Ninkovich continued his solid campaign by adding another 1.5 sacks and pressuring Taylor throughout. Rotating defensive linemen throughout the game has paid off for the Patriots as each group knows exactly what their job is, and they&#8217;re doing it well.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/11/25/notes-and-observations-week-11-defense-leads-battered-patriots-to-victory-over-bills-20-13/">Notes and Observations Week 11: Defense Leads Battered Patriots to Victory Over Bills 20-13</a> (978 words)</p>

This week was another prime example of just how good we have it here. The Patriots handled the Redskins all game and the win was never in doubt. Tom Brady finished just one yard shy of 300 for the day and threw for two more touchdowns. The defense played as good as they have been the past few weeks. Even with all that it was a bad game by Patriots&#8217; standards.</p>
<p>&#8211; Tom Brady put up another solid performance with 299 yards, going 26-39 with two touchdowns. He had a very uncharacteristic interception that made me do a double take to make sure it was Brady throwing the ball. It was a rare instance where he didn&#8217;t read the defense correctly and just never saw linebacker Keenan Robinson playing zone. Credit to Robinson for reading the play and making the interception, but that was a bad pass by Brady. Again, that&#8217;s how great it is to be a Patriots fan. These awful plays are so few and far between that it&#8217;s actually shocking when it happens.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/11/11/notes-and-observations-week-9-patriots-beat-redskins-27-10-to-go-8-0-for-2nd-time-in-team-history/">Notes and Observations, Week 9: Patriots Beat Redskins 27-10 to go 8-0 for 2nd Time in Team History</a> (929 words)</p>

(AP Photo/Michael Dwyer)" ></a><p>One of the best things about being a Patriots fan is having this luxury of knowing you&#8217;re going to the playoffs every year. Even more than that, you&#8217;re probably going to watch your team in the AFC Championship just like the past four years. In only week eight, the Patriots have basically wrapped up the AFC East. After emasculating the Dolphins on Thursday night they now have wins against each of their AFC East opponents. What&#8217;s more impressive is that score could have been a lot worse. The offense left a lot of first half points on the field as the defense was shutting the Dolphins down. That&#8217;s really nitpicking though as 36 points is nothing to bat an eye at.</p>
<p>&#8211; I genuinely hope everyone watching is really appreciating what Tom Brady is doing this season. What he&#8217;s doing at 38 years old is nothing short of amazing. On Thursday he went 26-38 for 356 yards, with four touchdowns and no interceptions. That brings his totals on the year to 2,410 yards with 20 touchdowns and only one interception that came off a bobbled pass from Julian Edelman. He&#8217;s on pace to throw over 5,500 yards, about 47 touchdowns, and maybe have three interceptions. He&#8217;s more focused than he&#8217;s ever been and it was never more apparent than on one play in the fourth quarter. With the game already in hand with a score of 29-7, Brady took a sack after missing a read. He then slammed the ball and his fist in frustration. Even though the game was already over Brady wasn&#8217;t satisfied. He wants to leave no points on the field. Tom Brady wants to win this season more than he wants anything in the world and I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anyone out there who can slow him down. (...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/11/02/notes-and-observations-week-8-patriots-virtually-clinch-afc-east-in-36-7-win-over-dolphins/">Notes and Observations, Week 8: Patriots Virtually Clinch AFC East in 36-7 Win Over Dolphins</a> (1,046 words)</p>

For two and a half quarters the Colts kept it interesting with the help of Mike Adams&#8217; pick-6 off the tipped pass from Julian Edelman. Gronk was virtually non-existent with the exception of his 25-yard touchdown catch-and-run. Andrew Luck was actually making plays when he had to. It seemed like for once the Colts were playing their best football against <em>their</em> most hated/feared rival (I emphasize their because lets face it no one in New England thinks this is a rivalry). Then it happened. The single dumbest play in the history of the NFL. &#8220;The fake punt.&#8221; After that play the Colts team and their fans were demoralized.</p>
<p>&#8211; The absolute best part about that play is that there was not one person in that whole organization that spoke up when they were practicing that play. Apparently they&#8217;ve been working on it for a while which makes it even better. In all that time not one of them had the brains to say &#8220;hey ya know guys&#8230;I don&#8217;t think this one&#8217;s going to work.&#8221; They all that that this was really going to get them. Right now they&#8217;re all saying it was a communication breakdown, the ball wasn&#8217;t supposed to be snapped, but that&#8217;s all a mask. In their heart of hearts they truly thought they had something special and instead it usurped the &#8220;Buttfumble&#8221; from its thrown of hilariously awful football plays. (...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/10/20/notes-and-observations-week-6-colts-run-the-dumbest-play-in-nfl-history-patriots-beat-them-again-34-27/">Notes and Observations, Week 6: Colts Run the Dumbest Play in NFL History; Patriots Beat Them Again 34-27</a> (1,099 words)</p>

In New England, the team and the fans could only see the things that they could improve on next week. The defense played exactly how it should and didn&#8217;t even surrender a touchdown on the road. All Belichick sees is how can the team lower the penalties called against them? Tom Brady continued his dominance with three total touchdowns, completing 20 out of 27 passes, and throwing for 275 yards with zero interceptions. All Belichick sees is how can he get the offensive line to protect Brady better and how can the team finally run a pick play they don&#8217;t get penalized for? That&#8217;s how spoiled we&#8217;ve become in New England that even with a dominant win on the road there is still so much work that can be done.</p>
<p>&#8211; Obviously this wasn&#8217;t Dallas&#8217; best team. With no Tony Romo and Dez Bryant they were already starting at a huge disadvantage. This game definitely plays differently if Romo and Bryant are healthy, but I still believe the Patriots defense could have matched up against them well. The game plan was perfect as they carried five defensive tackles on the active roster for the first time all season. There were times where they loaded up the box with nine men begging Brandon Weeden to pass on him. He didn&#8217;t and they contained the run all game. You can say what you want about the Cowboys sending out the JV offense but the bottom line the defense did exactly what it was supposed to do to that team. If it wasn&#8217;t for penalties on their two field goal drives, this game very well could have been a shutout.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/10/13/notes-and-observations-week-5-patriots-defense-solid-after-the-bye-week-beat-dallas-30-6/">Notes and Observations Week 5: Patriots Defense Solid After the Bye Week; Beat Dallas 30-6</a> (1,352 words)</p>
