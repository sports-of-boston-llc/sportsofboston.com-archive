<p>It seemed like we had the world in our hands going into the 2015-2016 season as Tom Brady was fresh out of a Deflategate court win. We had our starting quarterback for game one of the season, we were playing as the defending Super Bowl champions, and Brady&#8217;s revenge tour was engaged. We felt like nobody could stop our team. The Patriots had a fantastic season before coming up just short to the Denver Broncos in the AFC championship game.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2016/04/30/its-now-roger-goodell-vs-patriots-nation/">It&#8217;s Now Roger Goodell vs Patriots Nation</a> (580 words)</p>

<p>Brady&#8217;s next logical step is to appeal the ruling to have the enter second circuit court of appeals to hear the case, which currently has 2-2 record with federal judges. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s a slim chance that the court will hear the case&#8230; and an even slimmer chance that the case is heard by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

This means that Berman will rule on the case, a decision that he said will come &#8220;tomorrow or the next day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although no settlement was reached, Berman did say that he felt the sides had worked &#8220;quite hard&#8221; toward reaching one. If he upholds the suspension for Brady, the suspension will begin on Saturday, September 5. If he overturns the decision of the NFL, the suspension will be vacated. If he rules in the NFL&#8217;s favor, Brady could still appeal again and file for an injunction meaning he could play while that appeal is playing out.</p>
<p>Berman has been tough on the NFL in court, but that does not necessarily mean he will rule in Brady&#8217;s favor. The two sides had three negotiating sessions since August 1, but were unable to reach a deal.</p>

<p>Goodell initially responded to questioning by saying a decision is &#8220;coming soon&#8221; and then elaborated that it could be next week. Brady was originally suspended for the first four games if the 2015 season in May and his appeal was heard on June 23. The appeal was a marathon affair, lasting the entire day and into the night. Since the appeal, both sides have been mum regarding the potential outcome.</p>
<p>Patriots owner Robert Kraft was also spotted at the conference, but according to Goodell none of their discussions were regarding Brady.</p>

Photo courtesy fansided.com." ></a><p>Tom Brady will meet face to face with Roger Goodell on Tuesday in the much anticipated &#8220;deflategate&#8221; appeal. Brady will be looking to have his four game suspension completely wiped out. Goodell will be the arbitrator and have final say on whether or not Brady&#8217;s  case merits a change in his discipline. If he chooses to uphold the punishment, Brady will likely sue the league in Federal Court.</p>
<p>Brady has some science on his side as several organizations have recently come out to debunk the science in the Wells Report, including a lengthy New York Times article.(http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/opinion/deflating-deflategate.html?_r=0)</p>
<p>Brady also has the issue of precedent on his side as no violation of this minor a magnitude has ever been punished so severely. There is also no direct proof that Brady ordered the footballs to be lowered below the league minimum or that he endorsed the practice.</p>
<p>However, Brady will still have to overcome the fact that he refused to turn records of text messages over to investigators and he will have to prove no wrongdoing. If he cannot do this, it is unlikely that Goodell will wipe his entire punishment away, something that would cause the league to lose face and would be a waste of the Wells Report cost, which was reportedly over $5 million.</p>
<p>The decision will have lasting effect on both the NFL and the Patriots. If the suspension is overturned, the entire process in which the NFL investigated the Patriots and Brady will be questioned. Also, Goodell&#8217;s handling of all discipline would be questioned also, as this would not be the first time he had a major decision overturned. If the suspension is upheld, the league will be facing a court battle with one of its biggest stars. Needless to say, the fireworks for the NFL are going to come early this summer, and they will begin tomorrow.</p>

Since the &#8220;Deflategate&#8221; controversy and league penalties, one of the league&#8217;s most powerful owners was at odds with the offices on Park Avenue in New York.</p>
<p>Given his harsh statements toward the league prior to Super Bowl XLIX and his statements both after the league sanctions and to Peter King over the weekend,  he was viewed as an owner that would not only appeal the penalties, but possibly (although unlikely) go all the way to court.</p>
<p>Instead, Kraft did a 180 and announced that the team would accept the NFL penalties &#8220;reluctantly.&#8221; These penalties include the loss of a first and fourth round draft pick as well as a $1 million fine. Quarterback Tom Brady is still going ahead with his appeal of a four game ban.</p>
<p>Kraft said in part: &#8220;“I don’t want to continue the rhetoric that’s gone on for the last four months. I’m going to accept, reluctantly, what he (Roger Goodell) has given to us and not continue this dialogue and rhetoric, and we won’t appeal.’’</p>
<p>A league source told ESPN&#8217;s Adam Schefter that Kraft and Goodell had met prior to this press conference and even hugged. Many believe that Kraft offered to accept the team penalties in exchange for a lessening or eliminating of Brady&#8217;s suspension. So far, nothing has changed on the Brady front.</p>
<p>The reaction among fans was mixed. Some felt Kraft was doing the right thing by accepting the penalties and trying to move on. Others felt he was turning his back on his team for the good of his fellow owners and profits. Still more were puzzled at why an owner who had insisted on innocence was now accepting some measure of guilt by taking the penalties.</p>
<p>The truth is probably somewhere in the middle. Kraft still may feel his team is innocent, but that he would not win the appeal fight. If he was able to cut a deal and get Brady on the field for week one, then it is understandable. If not, then it is tough to justify spending so much time publicly fighting something to then just change course unless Kraft either knows members of his organization are guilty or he didn&#8217;t have the support of other owner&#8217;s in his fight.</p>
<p>One has to wonder also how Bill Belichick feels about all this. His press conference the Saturday after the allegations broke was the strongest public defense any member of the organization has done. He is also someone who highly values draft picks and has now lost two of them. And it is safe to say he would have been able to get the Patriots to play well without Brady in the first two or four weeks of the upcoming season. Now it seems all his efforts to prove his operation&#8217;s innocence has been for not.</p>
<p>The next crucial date in this saga will be Brady&#8217;s appeal. If the four games hold up, then Kraft&#8217;s acceptance is not only a loss for New England, but likely to ruffle the feathers of his two most important employees, Belichick and Brady. If the suspension is reduced, then Kraft will be praised for putting Brady above himself. Until then, it is likely we won&#8217;t hear anything from either side.</p>

<p>In the never-ending Deflategate saga, we have a new development this morning. Roger Goodell told CBS News that Ted Wells is nearly finished with the report.</p>
<p>“[Wells] has not been given a time frame, I expect it will not be long,” Goodell told Charlie Rose on CBS This Morning Tuesday.</p>
<p>The investigation began in late January after the Patriots were alleged to have played the first half of the AFC Championship game with 11 under-inflated footballs. </p>
<p>Goodell said Wells is trying to do a thorough job and hinted that they may be looking at one game &#8212; &#8220;The question is, one of the things that [Wells] would be asked to look for – was it just one game?” &#8212; before backtracking and saying that there&#8217;s no suspicion the under-inflated footballs were used in more than one game. </p>

After the beginning of the season if you told most people the Patriots would come out of their current six-game stretch with a 3-3 record, most people would have taken that as a plus. Fast forward to the week of Thanksgiving and there is a legitimate chance the Patriots don&#8217;t lose a single game of their difficult mid-season schedule. They&#8217;ve already handled the likes of the Bears, Broncos, Colts, and Lions. All that remains are trips to Green Bay and San Diego. Even if they lost one of those games, going 5-1 after most expected them to break even is a massive accomplishment. Personally, I don&#8217;t see how this Patriots team loses another game this season.</p>
<p>&#8211; There really aren&#8217;t enough good things to say about this defense. Granted the Lions haven&#8217;t been lighting up  the scoreboard but they do have terrific talent who can easily find the endzone. Thanks to another standout game from the secondary, all the Lions could muster was three field goals. The only real big plays came when the Patriots were in zone defense, i.e. Golden Tate&#8217;s 42-yard catch. Jamie Collins had Tate in coverage and got turned around allowing Tate to be wide open. Other than that, there were few mistakes made by Matt Patricia&#8217;s defense. (...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2014/11/25/notes-and-observations-week-12-patriots-continue-stretch-of-dominance-defeat-lions-34-9/">Notes and Observations Week 12: Patriots Continue Stretch of Dominance, Defeat Lions 34-9</a> (1,051 words)</p>
