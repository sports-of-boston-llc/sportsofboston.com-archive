For those who did not see, Eduardo Rodriguez pitched well over five and a third innings, but was pulled after recording an out, leaving the bases loaded for Tommy Layne, a below average middle reliever.</p>
<p>Layne promptly gave up six runs without recording an out, and when Farrell pulled him, Robbie Ross Jr. gave up another two, putting the game way out of reach, and embarrassing the Red Sox on national TV.</p>
<p>As frustrating as watching that game was, even a casual fan had to wonder why Farrell decided to get involved. Rodriguez&#8217;s pitch count was up, but should the manager have given him a chance to get out of the inning with the bottom of the order coming up? Perhaps yes, perhaps no. But if pulling him was the right decision, then-why Layne? Ziegler is your ground ball guy. Layne is the guy you put into a game that is already out of reach, and when it comes to the Kansas City Royals, a two run lead does not put a game out of reach. Citation: their eight runs in that same inning.</p>
<p>Farrell&#8217;s managing abilities come into question seemingly daily, taking off some of the pressure of under-performing Sox. Regardless, the fact remains-if this teams expects to advance past the ALDS, or take the AL East, their bullpen must show some backbone and record some important outs.</p>

<p>You can make the case that Porcello has been the Red Sox best pitcher so far this season.  He has a record of 11-2, his ERA is 3.66, and he has a WHIP of only 1.17.  These are stats that are much improved from his horrible campaign from last season, to make it worse he signed that 4 year contract worth 82.5 million dollars.  Last season it seemed like Porcello really couldn&#8217;t get a grip of the season, and really couldn&#8217;t figure out Boston.  Maybe that big contract got to his head?  If I had to guess I&#8217;d say yes it did.</p>
<p>This season tho he has been the most consistent pitcher The Sox have.  He has been able to get the tough outs when needed, and has pitched in some really big games this season.  Porcello shows no signs of slowing down, I totally expect him to continue his dominance post all-star break.  Porcello seems like he has more &#8216;guts&#8217; than the other guys on the staff.  With that being said, if the season comes down to one game it should be Porcello on the mound, not David Price.</p>

<p>The Red Sox got off to an early 1-0 lead coming from a single from Brock Holt.  Perfect position for Price.  On the road against the hated Yankees in New York, a real chance to show your worth and make Boston fans to start thinking differently about you.  An inning later the lead was gone, and 2 innings later The Red Sox trailed by 3 runs.  In the bottom of the 4th, Price had a chance to get out of a jam.  Didi Gregorius was at bat with bases loaded and 2 outs, Price had him down 0-2 in the count.  The next pitch Gregorius ripped a 3 run double to deep right field and the wheels fell off.  Gregorius is no all worldly hitter, he is only hitting .235 on the season, however, he was able to out battle The Red Sox ace and give the Yankees a 4-1 lead.  Price would give up 2 more runs on a Carlos Beltran single before exiting the game in the 4th inning.</p>
<p>A mind-blowing stat,  The Yankees only had one swing and miss on Price fastballs.  His (Price) velocity on his fastball has drastically dropped this season, and he can&#8217;t pinpoint his pitches like he used to.  With Price being 30 years old you got to think that his performance is falling off faster than The Sox could have predicted it.  Also if Price is getting timid and nervous during a regular season game in New York, then how is he going to look if The Red Sox are playing meaningful baseball in october?  It&#8217;s a scary thought for us Red Sox fans.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2016/05/07/another-start-another-disappointment/">Another Start, Another Disappointment.</a> (0 words)</p>
