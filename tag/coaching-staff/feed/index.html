<p>In a similar move, Lawrence Frank is leaving the Celtics&#8217; coaching staff for Detroit, where he was named the Pistons&#8217; head coach last week. Frank only spent a year as an assistant under Doc Rivers and was an adequate replacement for Thibodeau, who was regarded as the mastermind behind Boston&#8217;s shutdown defense. The rebuilding Pistons are certainly hoping that with a year under Rivers&#8217; tutelage, Frank can bring to the table something similar to what  Thibodeau brought to the Bulls in leading them to the East&#8217;s best regular season record.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2011/07/29/lawrence-frank-to-pistons-larry-brown-as-replacement-for-celtics/">Lawrence Frank to Pistons, Larry Brown as Replacement for Celtics?</a> (321 words)</p>

(Photo by AP)" ></a><p>While coaching staff previews are usually about the last thing NFL fans care to read, in New England, Patriots diehards worship at the altar of Bill Belichick. Though it may sound hyperbolic, Belichick has truly reached cult status in New England, the byproduct of three Super Bowl rings. For a long time it seemed that the Hooded One could do no wrong.</p>
<p>However as high profile coordinators scurried out of town one after another, detractors began raising flags. For the first time, their have been some cracks revealed in the previously impenetrable Belichick foundation. It has always been &#8220;In Bill We Trust,&#8221; give him the headset and get the hell out of the way. It didn&#8217;t matter who was surrounding him as long as he made the game plan and he trusted them to get their guys to execute it. It&#8217;s simple when you win titles, not so much otherwise. As the window closes on the Patriots&#8217; dynasty years, it will be interesting to see if the coaching staff can continue to keep their veterans motivated while getting the young guys and free agents up to speed.</p>
<h2>Head Coach: Bill Belichick</h2>
<p>Bill Belichick begins his 10th year at the helm and his 35th season in the league. He remains the only head coach in the league&#8217;s history to win three Super Bowls in four years. Belichick&#8217;s three wins ties him with Joe Gibbs and Bill Walsh for second place on the NFL&#8217;s all-time list. Titles aside, Belichick teams are also known for their ability to bounce back after a loss, and for their sustained success over the league&#8217;s top competition. From 2003 to 2009, Belichick&#8217;s Patriots were 18-1 (.947) in games following a loss. In that same spanm the Patriots went 32-13 against NFL Playoff teams, a .711 winning percentage. Usually devoid of many major stars, Belichick&#8217;s teams are smart, disciplined, and trusting of their teammates and of the game plan.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/08/09/patriots-2010-preview-coaching-staff/">Patriots 2010 Preview: Coaching Staff</a> (1,331 words)</p>
