<p>That wasn&#8217;t the only drama witnessed this weekend. Overall, there are 13 undefeated college football teams ranked in the AP top 25. If I were to tell you by this time in the season that both Alabama and Florida would not be atop their division, you may have not believed me. If I were to tell you that USC and Texas would be unranked, that may have garnered the same response.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this college football season has been spectacular.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/10/13/college-football-week-7-whos-hot/">College Football Week 7: Who&#8217;s Hot?</a> (558 words)</p>

Thousands of others will descend upon Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis to watch four teams compete for a national championship and eternal glory. Michigan State, Butler, West Virginia, and Duke are all that remains of the 65 team field that participated in what may have been the most exciting NCAA Tournament ever.</p>
<p>To get you ready for the games on Saturday, I&#8217;ve compiled a list of the eight key players to watch for.</p>
<h3>Kyle Singler (Duke):</h3>
<p>Singler is the heart and soul of the Duke Blue Devils. One of the top five college recruits of the 2007 class, the 6&#8217;8&#8243; forward has been a starter at Duke since his freshman year. He could have declared for the NBA draft after averaging 13.3 points and 5.9 rebounds per game in his sophomore season, but a loss to West Virginia in the second round of the NCAA Tournament left a bitter taste in his mouth, motivating him to return for another season. Singler, averaging 17.6 points 6.9 rebounds this season, has a chance for redemption on Saturday. Look for him to play with a BIG chip on his shoulder against the Mountaineers.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/04/02/ncaa-final-four-star-watch/">NCAA Final Four: Star Watch</a> (805 words)</p>

One reader, who named his/her bracket &#8220;I Own Coasties,&#8221; won the group with 142 of a possible 192 points. They correctly picked UNC and Villanova reaching the Final Four, and with some success in earlier rounds, it was strong enough to hold off two SoB staff members.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/04/07/north-carolina-wins-ncaa-championship/">North Carolina Wins NCAA Championship</a> (159 words)</p>

<p>Ahh, the peaks and valleys of the NCAA Tournament. By Saturday, I lost my first Elite Eight team, and subsequently my first Final Four team in Memphis. I had the seven other Elite Eight teams so I was still in great shape to win some much-need <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">money</span> bragging rights. At least, I thought I was in great shape&#8230;</p>
<p>Every single year, the University of Louisville, coached by the beloved Rick Pitino, seems to be in the NCAA Tournament. My strong &#8220;dislike&#8221; for Rick usually hurts me, as I usually have Louisville losing in the Sweet 16 or earlier. This year, as the No. 1 overall seed and in a bracket with a &#8220;weak&#8221; No. 2 in Michigan St., I figured Louisville had an easy ticket to the Final Four. I finally put my faith in Rick Pitino. What did he do? He screwed me once again, just like he screwed the Celtics.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/03/31/pitino-busts-my-ncaa-bracket-again/">Pitino Busts My NCAA Bracket Again</a> (241 words)</p>
