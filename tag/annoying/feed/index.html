Over the course of my time as a Boston sports fan, I have noticed many announcers/sports personalities that are completely off in their analysis. This could include why a team is struggling, their insights on a major trade or butchering a widely known players name such as Brad Marchand. With Marchand, it was not until the 2nd game of the Stanley Cup Finals two years ago that the announcers said his name correctly.</p>
<p>Regardless, an unbiased and true commentator brings plenty to the booth and studio, but this list accomplishes the complete opposite.</p>
<h2>10th- ESPN&#8217;S Skip Bayless and Stephen A. Smith</h2>
<p>These two analysts need to be pared together in this list because it is always them I see arguing every morning with one another. Skip and Stephen A. are adults that act like children on the set of ESPN&#8217;S <em>First Take.</em> Stephen A never lets Skip speak, always yelling and telling Skip he is wrong, but then when it is Skip&#8217;s turn to fire back all he does is yell back at Stephen A. with narcissistic and contrarian remarks just to be difficult. Some of the most notable include Skip telling the public that Tim Tebow will be a very good QB (years ago) and still refusing to give LeBron James credit for his play.</p>
<h2>9th- 98.5 Sports Hub&#8217;s Jermaine Wiggins</h2>
<p>Wiggins helped the Patriots win a superbowl years ago, but whenever he visits the Sports Hub, he seems to always be off on his analysis. Just a fair warning, do not get him started on the Bruins, he becomes completely befuddled and but still attempts to break down the Bruins. Wiggins also has one of those voices that you are grateful that is not calling Red Sox games.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2013/06/26/top-10-most-annoying-sports-personalities-of-all-time/">Top 10 Most Annoying Sports Personalities of All Time</a> (602 words)</p>
