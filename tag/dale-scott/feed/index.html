Man, Scott was terrible. (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)" ></a><p>Normally, I don&#8217;t even mention the umpiring/officiating when putting together these game reviews (unless we&#8217;re talking about the NBA, where &#8220;referee&#8221; and &#8220;crook&#8221; are synonymous terms). But, home plate umpire Dale Scott&#8217;s performance on Wednesday afternoon at Fenway, especially in the ninth inning, was poor at best; and crooked at worst.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the ninth, with the Red Sox down 3-0 but threatening to score. Kevin Youkilis was on first base after a single, and the white-hot J.D. Drew was at the plate. Normally mild-mannered, Drew turned back to talk to Scott on two occasions during the at bat for pitches well outside the strike zone. Drew has a keen eye, and I&#8217;m apt to trust his judgment, but NESN&#8217;s Amica Pitch Zone clearly showed that both pitches were at least six inches outside the strike zone. Drew, facing a 3-2 count instead of a walk, blasted a run-scoring double over the head of Vernon Wells in center field.</p>
<p>Next up was David Ortiz, who represented the tying run at the plate. Jays closer Kevin Gregg was all over the strike zone (but rarely in it), and Ortiz brought his usual patience at bat. Facing a 3-2 pitch, Ortiz watched what appeared to be Ball 4&#8230;but was instead Strike 3 on a pitch at least 6-8 inches off the plate. Instead of having Ortiz walking to first base, the Red Sox lost a baserunner, and Ortiz was nearly ejected for arguing his case.</p>
<p>Now with two outs in the inning, Adrian Beltre stepped to the plate hoping to drive in Drew. During his at bat, he appeared to check his swing, but the umpire (Scott) called it a swing and refused to check with the first base umpire. This brought out Terry Francona, who was immediately ejected for coming out of the dugout during an at-bat. Perhaps with a fire lit under him, Beltre singled home Drew to bring the Sox one run closer. Unfortunately, it was too little, too late: <strong>Blue Jays 3, Red Sox 2, Dale Scott 1</strong>.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/05/12/umps-snider-help-jays-sneak-by-red-sox/">Umps, Snider Help Jays Sneak By Red Sox</a> (350 words)</p>
