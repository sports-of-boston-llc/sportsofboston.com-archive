But, Lester did what he could to make some Boston sports fans smile on a day when most would rather mope.</p>
<p>In the midst of his quest for 20 wins, Lester put forth a strong effort, going seven innings and allowing zero runs on four hits and four walks to lead the Sox to a 6-0 win. He struck out four to earn his 18th win and help his team avoid a sweep at the hands of the Jays.</p>
<p>Offensively, the Red Sox did all their damage in the fourth and fifth innings. Victor Martinez stroked his 18th homer of the season in the fourth, and the Red Sox got five more in the fifth on an RBI double from Daniel Nava, a two-run single from Yamaico Navarro, and a two-run HR from J.D. Drew.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/09/20/lester-avenges-patriots-loss-beats-blue-jays-for-18th-win/">Lester Avenges Patriots Loss, Beats Blue Jays for 18th Win</a> (163 words)</p>

(AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Nathan Denette)" ></a><p>It was the kind of offensive display that any pitching staff would salivate over. The boys of summer needed a laugher in their favor for a change, and got it on Wednesday night, as the Boston Red Sox out-slugged the Toronto Blue Jays on their way to a <strong>10-1 victory</strong>. While the Yankees managed to avoid a sweep at the hands of the Texas Rangers, the Rays finally dropped one to the Tigers, and now the Sox stand within 3 1/2 games of the Wild Card.</p>
<p>After Boston put across one run in the top of the first without even managing a hit, starter Clay Buchholz gave one back in the bottom of the first when Victor Martinez let a passed ball by him; the runner later scored on a sacrifice fly. But Buchholz was able to let loose and let it fly from there, and put zeroes up on the board for seven more innings to lower his ERA to an A.L.-best 2.49. And his offense finally provided more than enough run support to secure Buchholz&#8217; 13th win of the season.<br />

Man, Scott was terrible. (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)" ></a><p>Normally, I don&#8217;t even mention the umpiring/officiating when putting together these game reviews (unless we&#8217;re talking about the NBA, where &#8220;referee&#8221; and &#8220;crook&#8221; are synonymous terms). But, home plate umpire Dale Scott&#8217;s performance on Wednesday afternoon at Fenway, especially in the ninth inning, was poor at best; and crooked at worst.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the ninth, with the Red Sox down 3-0 but threatening to score. Kevin Youkilis was on first base after a single, and the white-hot J.D. Drew was at the plate. Normally mild-mannered, Drew turned back to talk to Scott on two occasions during the at bat for pitches well outside the strike zone. Drew has a keen eye, and I&#8217;m apt to trust his judgment, but NESN&#8217;s Amica Pitch Zone clearly showed that both pitches were at least six inches outside the strike zone. Drew, facing a 3-2 count instead of a walk, blasted a run-scoring double over the head of Vernon Wells in center field.</p>
<p>Next up was David Ortiz, who represented the tying run at the plate. Jays closer Kevin Gregg was all over the strike zone (but rarely in it), and Ortiz brought his usual patience at bat. Facing a 3-2 pitch, Ortiz watched what appeared to be Ball 4&#8230;but was instead Strike 3 on a pitch at least 6-8 inches off the plate. Instead of having Ortiz walking to first base, the Red Sox lost a baserunner, and Ortiz was nearly ejected for arguing his case.</p>
<p>Now with two outs in the inning, Adrian Beltre stepped to the plate hoping to drive in Drew. During his at bat, he appeared to check his swing, but the umpire (Scott) called it a swing and refused to check with the first base umpire. This brought out Terry Francona, who was immediately ejected for coming out of the dugout during an at-bat. Perhaps with a fire lit under him, Beltre singled home Drew to bring the Sox one run closer. Unfortunately, it was too little, too late: <strong>Blue Jays 3, Red Sox 2, Dale Scott 1</strong>.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/05/12/umps-snider-help-jays-sneak-by-red-sox/">Umps, Snider Help Jays Sneak By Red Sox</a> (350 words)</p>

<p>Buchholz pitched eight strong innings, srtiking out four and walking only two, as the Red Sox went on <strong>to beat the Blue Jays 2-1</strong>. The righty improved to 2-2 on the season after suffering back-to-back losses to the Texas Rangers and Tampa Bay Rays.</p>
<p>Buchholz pitched just long enough to earn the win, as the less-than-stellar Red Sox offense scored the go-ahead run in the top of the eighth inning. In a move we&#8217;ve recently seen, Mike Lowell came in to pinch hit for David Ortiz with the bases loaded in the eighth inning, earning a walk to drive in what would be the winning run of the game.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/04/28/buchholz-brings-a-game-in-red-sox-victory/">Buchholz Brings A-Game in Red Sox Victory</a> (205 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight the Red Sox are going for their second three game sweep this year of Toronto. The Sox have won four in a row and are seven games up on the Yankee&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Jacoby Ellsbury is in the lineup again tonight. In Jacoby Ellsbury&#8217;s four games of starting in September he is 8-12 with 1 2B, 1 3B, 2 HRs and 5 RBI. In 363 AB&#8217;s in AAA Ellsbury had only 2 HR&#8217;s. He&#8217;s been a huge asset to the Sox in his short stint.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every game (Ellsbury&#8217;s) played, it&#8217;s not only exciting, it&#8217;s very beneficial to us winning,&#8221; Red Sox manager Terry Francona said.</p>
<p>Post All-Star Break this is what the starting pitchers have looked like.</p>
