The 6&#8217;2, 266 pound defensive end is not as large as some of the prototypical pass rushers in the NFL, but he uses his length as well as anyone and makes plays with his strength.</p>
<p>The Patriots have quite a bit of depth in terms of pass rushers with Chandler Jones, Rob Ninkovich, Jabaal Sheard, and Dominique Easley all ahead of Flowers on the depth chart. When asked what he felt his role could be in such a crowded group, Flowers said he was eager to contribute any way he could.</p>
<p>“I’m just coming out here and working hard. I want to be that guy who can get his reps when he can, who is attentive, who listens to all the coaches, and contribute wherever I need to be,&#8221; Flowers said.</p>
<p>One of the best ways for Flowers to get on the field early is to be as versatile as possible. He had opportunities both inside and outside along the defensive line in practice.  The rookie felt that being able to do both was important for him and for his teammates.</p>
<p>“It’s definitely a way that I can help the team the fastest that I can. Being able to go out to in and things like that…like I said, I’m just trying to establish a role and if that’s what the coach wants me to do, go inside sometimes and outside I&#8217;m all for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flowers is making the most of his opportunities in camp thus far. He has looked explosive in several drills and has been around the football in full team work. At this point, he has had most of his chances with backups and will likely see extensive time in the preseason as he tries to climb his way up the depth chart. Playing at Arkansas in the SEC, Flowers is no stranger to big games or strong competition. In one week he will have his first taste of NFL action as the Patriots host the Packers in the team&#8217;s first preseason game. Flowers is looking forward to the chance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m just looking forward to going against someone other than my teammates. Camp can be long, going against the same people each and every day, but I’m looking forward to going against someone else. I wouldn’t say there are any nerves, it’s all football. I’m just trying to go out there and do it as best I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Flowers can produce in the preseason as well as he as at times during camp, he will continue that climb up the depth chart.</p>

Photo courtesy Patriots.com" ></a><p>The Patriots added eleven players over the weekend during the NFL draft. They also added several undrafted free agents after the conclusion of the draft Saturday night. Early on, the Patriots went with a defensive focus with their first four picks (and seven out of eleven total picks) were on that side of the ball. New England spent all of their offensive picks on day three, picking two guards and a tight end. One long snapper was also picked by the team.</p>
<p>With the loss of Darrelle Revis and Brandon Browner this offseason, the Patriots have chosen to invest more in their front seven and hope to generate pass rush to force turnovers instead of forcing coverage sacks and turnovers due to lock down secondary play. This shift began with Revis and Browner leaving, continued with the Jabaal Sheard signing, and was added to on draft weekend. Three of the Patriots first four picks were defensive lineman or pass rushers including first round pick Malcolm Brown. Brown, a behemoth defensive tackle out of Texas, should instantly contribute to the Patriots interior pressure on both passing and rushing downs. Dominque Easley is a bit of a wild card, if he can come back healthy in 2015 he and Brown could combine to create a young, formidable defensive tackle duo. Defensive end Geneo Grissom, a third round pick, is somewhat comparable to Jamie Collins, a high level athlete who couldn’t quite find a niche on a college defense. He is not as talented as Collins, but could add some depth behind the Patriots budding star linebacker. Trey Flowers could end up being a steal at defensive end as well. He was picked at the top of the fourth round and very well could end up going at the end of the second or in the third.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/05/05/patriots-2015-draft-picks-review/">Patriots 2015 Draft Picks Review</a> (454 words)</p>

<p>Flowers led the Razorbacks in tackles for loss (15.5) and had six sacks. He is a powerful edge player who could look to get snaps in sub defense and third down situations. His 6&#8217;2&#8243;, 266 pound frame was best on display in SEC play this season, especially against Texas A&amp;M. His speed is not great, which has him rely more on his power and bull rush than anything else. It was another team captain selection for New England, as Flowers was a leader and captain of the Arkansas defense.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/05/02/patriots-select-three-in-round-four-including-finally-two-guards/">Patriots Select Three in Round Four, Including (Finally) two Guards</a> (236 words)</p>
