Let me speak for the majority of Bruins fans here when I say that I&#8217;ve been pleasantly surprised thus far since I wasn&#8217;t expecting this team to be as competitive as they are at this point.</p>
<p>My biggest concern entering this season, along with almost everyone who&#8217;s followed the B&#8217;s the past couple years, was their dull defensive group. On paper, they are one of the worst units in the entire NHL but so far, they&#8217;ve managed to not completely sink the teams and fans postseason aspirations. Granted they have had their moments where they look like they&#8217;re fishing for swordfish in their own end, however it hasn&#8217;t been as bad as it could be. Obviously, the white knight in this case has been the expected-unexpected emergence of Brandon Carlo.</p>
<p>The 19 year-old from Colorado Springs has stepped right into the top pairing alongside Zdeno Chara and has done just about everything that has been asked of him at this point. His big 6&#8217;5&#8243; frame knows how to maneuver around the ice and his impressive poise combined with his simple, no-nonsense style of play has absolutely been a welcome addition to the Bruins backend. I will say that he certainly does look his age on the ice at times as he gets thrown around quite a bit and sometimes looks overwhelmed in the D-zone but all that comes down to inexperience and that will improve the more he plays. Basically, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s too much of a stretch to say Carlo has been a huge reason this team has been as successful as they are in the early-goings of the year.</p>
<p>Behind Carlo and the other five defensemen on the ice stands a man that was on the verge of being run out of Boston this fall in Tuukka Rask. However, after amassing one of the best starts of his career this season recording an 11-3-0 record in 14 appearances, it would be foolish to overlook the contributions Rask has made to the B&#8217;s 11-8-0 overall record. To keep it simple, every game Rask hasn&#8217;t started the Bruins have lost, and those games were missing the same feel to it with Rask on the bench. Not only that, but for the most part, Rask has been an imposing presence in the crease making the majority of his saves look very easy. If Tuukka can keep this up he&#8217;s going to be in contention for the Vezina Trophy at the end of the season, alongside my favorite goalie in the league in Carey Price (sarcasm, of course) and could single-handily lead the B&#8217;s to the playoffs for the first time in three seasons.</p>
<p>The last player I&#8217;ve noticed more than any other through 19 games has been David Pastrnak. I&#8217;m glad to be saying this because I really enjoy what Pastrnak has brought to the table since he&#8217;s been on the roster and I think he&#8217;s the true goal scorer the Bruins have missed since trading Tyler Seguin. Leading the team with 10 goals, Pastrnak has looked much more confident in the offensive zone stringing together some nice plays with Patrice Bergeron and Brad Marchand. The one concern I have surrounding his game though is his health. Similar to Carlo, Pastrnak is a young kid still developing muscle and is more at risk to injury because he&#8217;s on the weaker side. It&#8217;s been an issue in the past and it has popped up already this season, so if anything will hold him back this year, it&#8217;ll be the injury bug. Other than that, it&#8217;s clear that his overall game is starting to show improvement as his back-checking alone has improved ten-fold, as well as his defensive game in general, and it&#8217;ll be critical once the big games roll around in February and March.</p>
<p>Like I said, while the B&#8217;s haven&#8217;t been tremendous so far, they also haven&#8217;t looked dreadful. This team really didn&#8217;t have much roster turnover and the new guys on the roster, with the exception of David Backes, are all young players still trying to fill a role so at least to me, it&#8217;s hard to be upset with the results we&#8217;ve gotten so far. As a team, they seem to be a lot more likeable than in years past and I feel like that comes from their tendency, at least until now, to not give up in games. Other than an embarrassing 5-0 loss to the Minnesota Wild on Oct. 25 and two 5-2 losses to the New York Rangers, every game they lost was a back-and-forth game that I felt they had a good chance to win.</p>
<p>Look at their most recent game against the St. Louis Blues, a couple bounces go their way and they more-likely-than-not walk away with a win against a predominantly top Western Conference team. A 3-2 loss at Montreal also comes to mind in this example as the B&#8217;s were the better team in this game, but just couldn&#8217;t muster a goal past Price. This could be the most important aspect to this years team because as we all know, part of the reason they&#8217;ve failed to make the playoffs was their inability to win big games down the stretch. If they are showing some heart now, I can&#8217;t imagine that&#8217;ll disappear once the games become even more important down the line.</p>
<p>When it all boils down to it in April, we&#8217;ll look back on this start and the towering play of Carlo, Rask&#8217;s extraordinary start, the superb play of Pastrnak, and the overall pride this year&#8217;s team possesses and be shocked. Hopefully it&#8217;ll be a positive shock because they didn&#8217;t get a higher seeding in the playoffs, and not a negative shock if they fail to make the postseason, again. Now that would be something I would not be thankful for.</p>

Photo: Aaron Doster (USA Today Sports)" ></a><p>Recently, the Boston Bruins made NHL headlines when they signed former Blues captain David Backes to a 5-year, $30 million contract. Backes, who had 21 goals and 45 points last season, joins a Bruins squad that recently absorbed the losses of Loui Eriksson (VAN), Dennis Seidenberg (UFA), and Chris Kelly (OTT).</p>
<p>David Backes is 32 years old, and potentially worth the $6 million per year. His 21 goals last year were his least since the 2009-10 season. However, Backes also brings a certain amount of physicality to the ice: his 239 hits last season were good for 13th in the NHL. A return to the playoffs is desperately wanted in Boston, and the addition of the experienced center will provide guidance for an otherwise younger team.</p>
<p>In addition to Backes, the Bruins also kept young defenseman Torey Krug signed throughout the 2019-20 season, with an average annual salary of $5.25 million. The move, paired with the buying out of Seidenberg&#8217;s contract, signifies a change in philosophy for the B&#8217;s: give the younger guys a chance, and start building towards a powerhouse that can win a championship within the next few years. While Krug did pump out 40 assists (9th amongst NHL defenseman), his goal output was smaller that he is used to.</p>
<p>Other signings so far for the Bruins include goalie Anton Khudobin and Riley Nash, a former Carolina Hurricanes forward. Nash, according to a Bruins report, has tallied three straight twenty point seasons, and could prove useful as a staple in the fourth line.</p>

<p>If you looked at the two teams on paper they were incredibly even matched and when you watched the game on the ice you knew that the statistics didn’t lie. This game was a battle down to the very last shootout goal.</p>
<h2>First Period</h2>
<p>The first period started out as expected with each team flying around the rink and throwing their bodies into anything that moved. Both teams got their opportunities in the offensive zone and fired off shot after shot. Both goalies and defenses were able to hold their own for most of the first period.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2013/11/22/bruins-lose-hard-fought-game-to-worthy-blues/">Bruins Lose Hard-Fought Game to Worthy Blues</a> (611 words)</p>
