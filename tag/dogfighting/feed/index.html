<p>No.</p>
<p>Some people, such as Michael Irvin, an NFL Hall of Famer, have glorified Vick lately for his past career in the NFL. So, does anyone actually remember what it was like when Vick played as quarterback for the Falcons? The victorious seasons? There were few. 2004 was the only season that he can pride himself on, as the Falcons went 11-5.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/07/23/anyone-want-to-take-a-bite-out-of-michael-vick/">Anyone Want to Take a Bite Out of Michael Vick?</a> (288 words)</p>

<p>Michael Vick has been sentenced to 23 months in prison by a federal judge for dogfighting conspiracy charges.</p>
<p>Through a plea deal, Vick admitted bankrolling the dog fighting operation which took place at a home Vick owned. Vick initially denied killing dogs himself, but failed a polygraph test when asked about it and now says he was actively involved in killing at least one dog, tying the noose and hanging the animal.</p>
<p>Vick started serving his sentence in November and with good behavior could be out in 18 months. It should be noted that Vick received the near maximum penalty, due largely in part because the judge was unimpressed by Vick&#8217;s actions before his sentencing. Reports are that Vick tested positive for marijuana after turning himself in to police.</p>
<p><strong>My Take:</strong> I feel justice was done today. I was afraid that because of the plea deal and Vick not having to admit some things I think he did, he would get off with a light sentence. This former NFL star will now be in jail for nearly <em>two years</em>, with the first possibility of release coming in May 2009 on good behavior. I&#8217;m far from an animal lover but it was a despicable thing he did, and was not a spur-of-the-moment mistake, but a pre-meditated, multi-year illegal gambling ring with murderous practices.</p>
<p>His NFL career should be over because of the sheer low class, low character crime he committed, but in a league who gives Ricky Williams another chance, the jury is out. I hope for his sake that he does his time, gets released and goes on with his life in quiet. I don&#8217;t see how any sports fan could cheer for him once he gets out of prison. Good thing we won&#8217;t have to worry about that until mid to late 2009.</p>
