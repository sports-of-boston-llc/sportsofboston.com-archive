This was their 6th straight win and they have now moved into the top spot in the wildcard. They are now only one game behind Toronto for first place in the division. One of the many reasons the Sox are playing so well is star outfielder, Mookie Betts.  Betts is playing unbelievable right now and definitely should be in discussion for MVP right now. Since August, he has batted .403, with seven homeruns and 20 RBI’s. He had a three home-run game against Arizona on the 14th and a two home-run game against the Orioles on the 16th. The three home-run game was Bett’s second time doing that this season and the first time a Red Sox player has done that since the great Ted Williams. I know that Jose Altuve is having an amazing year, batting .364 for the Astros, but if the Sox make the playoffs and the Astro’s don’t than Betts should hands down get the MVP.</p>
<p>The Red Sox starting pitching has also been a big factor why they have won 6th straight games. In the past seven days the Sox starting pitching has only let up a total of eleven runs. Rick Porcello picked up his 16th win on Sunday, and all season long has given the Sox a pitcher they can rely on. If Porcello keeps pitching as well as he has, he will definitely be in the discussion for Cy young. Rodriguez has also been a nice surprise lately. In the month of August he has an ERA of 2.08. It really seems like he is turning around his season. Unfortunately, on Tuesday, while pitching a no hitter through four innings he had to come out of the game due to injury. Hopefully, this is just something minor and continues to pitch well for the rest of the season.</p>
<p>The Sox have 43 games left and a three game lead in the Wild card standings so as of right now they are in a good position to make the playoffs. I believe that they will and if they don’t I will consider this season a disappointment. Go sox!</p>

The heralded ace David Price has been good this season with a 7-3 record and 91 strikeouts, but his 4.63 ERA leaves plenty of room for improvement. Then there is Steven Wright, who has unexpectedly taken over the second spot in the rotation through his stellar consistency. The knuckle ball profile fits more in the middle to back end of a pitching staff, but Wright&#8217;s impressive performance and lack of a viable alternative have propelled him to the front in the rotation.</p>
<p>Rick Porcello follows Wright in the rotation. The twenty-seven year old had an exciting start to the season but has since seen his ERA creep over four in June, which lends itself to some concerns. The return of Eduardo Rodriguez is a welcome addition and can help boost the rotation if he performs, but doubts about the overall quality and depth of the pitching staff are imminent.</p>
<p>After Price there are some critical questions that need to be addressed, and it begins with Steven Wright. Is he really a top two starter for a potential division winner? There is no doubt he has been outstanding this year, the most consistent pitcher on the team, but the unreliable nature of the knuckleball is a tad concerning. It would behoove the Red Sox to see an emergence from either Porcello or Rodriguez as consistent performance from one of these two traditional pitchers would help stabilize the top of the rotation and ease any excessive expectations of Steven Wright.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with the rotation is the vacancy left by disastrous seasons from both Clay Buchholz and Joe Kelly. Buchholz has the potential to rebound from his demotion to the bullpen if he can find his command, but Kelly on the other hand is a lost cause. Even worse, in his last start with Pawtucket Kelly left the game after four and two thirds innings with an apparent groin injury.</p>
<p>Thanks to the friendly nature of the Red Sox schedule until mid June, John Farrell announced that he will employ a four man rotation until June 18th. At that point he wants someone to grab the role of fifth starter and demand that spot through their performance. This offers an opportunity not only to the incumbents Buchholz and Kelly, but also Henry Owens and Roenis Elias whom have both spent most of the season in Pawtucket.</p>
<p>If these problems with the pitching staff are not addressed from within the organization the front office will have to make a trade. This is potentially problematic because the market for quality pitching at this season&#8217;s trade deadline appears minimal. The two top options are Sonny Gray of the Oakland Athletics and the Atlanta Braves&#8217; Julio Teheran, both of whom will demand a healthy package of top prospects in return.</p>
<p>In an ideal world the team will find a resolution from within the organization, but earlier this week Dave Dombrowski announced he is looking for both starting and relief pitching help before the August 1st deadline. It remains to be seen how the situation will unfold, but pitching is a key element of success for any baseball team and Red Sox could use some help both in rotation and the bullpen as they prepare for a pennant race and playoff run.</p>

This is surprising, since the sheer amount of firepower displayed by the Red Sox may have led one to believe that they put up 15 runs per game.</p>
<p>Bogaerts did run his hit streak to 26 games, and the Red Sox did win the first two games to walk away with a split, but there is an air of disappointment after they dropped the final two games. The pitching staff gave up 25 runs over the final 18 innings, which is no recipe for success. Joe Kelly was largely to blame, giving up 7 ERs in 2.1 innings, but Porcello did nothing to assuage the bleeding, giving up 5 ERs in 6 full and allowing three long home runs.</p>
<p>The Red Sox will remain up a game on the Orioles in the AL East, as they look to widen the gap over the Toronto Blue Jays, who are suddenly only 3.5 games behind.</p>
<p>Tonight, David Price (7-1, 5.11) will look to get the Red Sox back to their winning ways. Price faced Toronto on May 29th and pitched well, giving the Red Sox enough support to propel them to a 5-3 victory. He will face his former team for a third time at 7:10 in Boston, and will be facing R.A. Dickey (2-6, 4.64) who cannot beat the Red Sox. In three starts against them, Dickey has led the Blue Jays to a loss each time. Price&#8217;s 94 mph fastball should be able to take down Dickey once more. Expect the knuckleball to be close to ineffective. <strong>Final score: BOS 8, TOR 3</strong></p>

He was expected to settle into Boston&#8217;s rotation and this anticipation had cultivated an anxious hope that he could build on an impressive rookie campaign. That anxiety boiled for over three months after the injury. The Red Sox front office exercised caution with Rodriguez through his rehab program, and then kept him in Pawtucket for five starts before recalling him. On Tuesday night at Camden Yards,  Rodriguez was finally ready for his debut with the Red Sox and he handled the occasion in stride. He threw 89 pitches over the course of six full innings, allowing just two earned on six hits and no walks.</p>
<p>The offense opened the game with back-to-back solo home runs by Mookie Betts and Dustin Pedroia, and by the bottom of the second inning the Red Sox had a five run advantage. Rodriguez did not relinquish that lead. He used his fastball early in counts and then worked in a sharp change-up to strike out three batters.</p>
<p>The essential aspect of Rodriguez outing was that it quieted worries about his velocity that had risen when he did not feature 95 mph heater during his starts in Pawtucket. Against the Orioles, he consistently sat around 92 mph with the fastball but touched 94 mph and as he continues to regain both arm and lower body strength the velocity should continue to return.</p>
<p>The addition of Eduardo Rodriguez to the roster adds a sense of insurance to a pitching staff that has some holes with neither Clay Buchholz nor Joe Kelly having proven himself capable of retiring MLB hitters. Buchholz was the man relegated to the bullpen in response to Rodriguez&#8217;s return and after Kelly&#8217;s disastrous outing last night he was optioned to Pawtucket. which leaves a void in the rotation. It remains to be seen how the Red Sox will fill this vacancy but Rodriguez&#8217;s presence should help take some pressure off of the pitching staff as a unit.</p>
<p>His return also presents a precarious situation for the front office. Rodriguez activation from the disabled list feels like the prize of a trade deadline deal. As the deadline approaches this acquisition will have to effect the front office&#8217;s decision making. While it remains to be seen how this process will unfold but there is no doubt that Rodriguez&#8217;s return addresses an important hole in the rotation.</p>
<p>Rodriguez is regarded as one of the more promising young pitchers in baseball and has plenty of time to develop. A role in the middle of the Red Sox rotation this season will serve to curb the lofty expectations of Red Sox fans as the lefty continues to mature, but few question he has the raw talent of a future ace. The camaraderie in the clubhouse should help Rodriguez hone his craft as he learns from the savvy veterans during the playoff push, and fans can expect him to make a solid contribution as the Red Sox strive to stay atop the competitive AL East.</p>

Boston&#8217;s latest action came in the form of a trade with the Seattle Mariners. The Sox traded lefty starter Wade Miley and Jonathan Aro for reliever Carson Smith and Roenis Elias.</p>
<p>Miley was a fiery competitor who occasionally bumped heads with Red Sox manager John Farrell last season in his first and only season in Boston. The left hander was a solid middle of the rotation starter for Boston going 11-11 with a 4.46 ERA and leading the team in innings pitched with 193 plus in 32 starts. The quality that Boston may miss most about Miley is his durability. He is able to go out and pitch every fifth day for which the same cannot be said for the injury-prone Clay Buchholz and Joe Kelly who are likely to sandwich Rick Porcello with the third and fifth starter spots to open to season. The reason for moving Miley is the need for an upgrade in the bullpen and financially his contract is very reasonable for the Mariners to manage. It is also known that Dombrowski wasn&#8217;t willing to deal the young, hard-throwing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez who pitched well for Boston in his first season in the majors going 10-6 with a 3.85 ERA. It also always seems like Red Sox fans and management alike start every season with the same sentence about Clay Buchholz, &#8220;If he can just stay healthy&#8230;&#8221; which he inevitably does not. However whether the Red Sox are unwilling to let go of the potential 1/3 of a season ace or other teams have lost interest in watching him get scratched night after night Buchholz is staying put in Boston, at least for now. As for the possibility of dealing Porcello, Boston pretty much hitched their wagon to him with a 4-year $82.5 million dollar contract last season and with the way he pitched no one is chomping at the bit there.</p>
<p>Now what did the Red Sox get in return? A 26-year old, right handed, side arm delivery reliever in Carson Smith. The young Smith is considered to have a power arm, hurling a fastball in the 93-95 MPH range with a killer, swing-and-miss slider, especially for righties, and the ability to mix in a changeup. In 70 innings pitched last season with Seattle he was able to produce 92 strikeouts, this exemplifies the kind of stuff he is bringing to the Red Sox bullpen. Smith went 2-5 with 22 holds, 13 saves and a 2.31 ERA in 2015. His roll in the much improved Boston bullpen will likely be a seventh inning set up man with Koji Uehara pitching the eighth and Craig Kimbrel now taking over as the closer. This kind of late inning fire power has been a successful model in recent years. The Royals had great success all season and will be handing out World Series rings with much thanks to their bullpen, the Yankees have also developed a one-two knockout punch in Dellin Betances and Andrew Miller coming out of the pen to finish games.</p>
<p>Sox manager John Farrell had this to say regarding the now weaponized Sox bullpen: &#8220;What&#8217;s clearly different with this group is that it&#8217;s deeper in talent, it&#8217;s deeper in performance, it&#8217;s deeper in the ability to get strikeouts in key spots. We&#8217;ve got the ability to now assign innings to individual guys where they can probably mentally prepare for that inning.&#8221;</p>
<p>An included advantage in the revamped bullpen is depth and flexibility. Smith has been a set up man and closer in the past and could be up to the task if Uehara needed a night off. Uehara has been the Sox closer for the past few seasons if rest for Kimbrel is necessary. Lets also not forget about the hard-throwing Junichi Tazawa who can rotate in for back end relief. It appears a weakness of lasts year&#8217;s Red Sox team may have been turned into a strength in just a few short months this off season.</p>
<p>Boston also acquired Cuban-born, 27-year old Roenis Elias who went 5-8 with a 4.14 ERA in 20 starts last season. The lefty also had two relief appearances. It is unclear at this time what Boston will do with him, it is thought that he could add depth to the starting rotation or compete for a spot in the bullpen. Elias&#8217; ability to get a starting spot may hinge on whether the Red Sox go hard after another starter such as veteran Cliff Lee who stated he plans to pitch in 2016.</p>
<p>Dombrowski and the Red Sox have aggressively taken care of business early and put themselves in great position to sit back and listen to possible trades and opportunities as baseball&#8217;s winter meetings continue in Nashville Tennessee.</p>

Most of them are pretty obvious and involve pitching, but let’s get into it. Below are the Red Sox three most glaring needs, in no particular order.</p>
<h2>An Ace</h2>
<p>This one has already been talked about a lot and is pretty obvious, as 2015 proved the harsh reality that a rotation full of mediocre pitchers gets a team nowhere. The Red Sox are in a good position with some of their younger pitchers, including <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=13164&amp;position=P">Eduardo Rodriguez</a>, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=13143&amp;position=P">Henry Owens</a>, and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=14272&amp;position=P">Brian Johnson</a>, but those guys are not yet ready to be legitimate number one starters. Fortunately, the Free Agent and Trade markets are likely to be flush with top-notch starting pitching; it will be up to Dave Dombrowski to decide how to allocate his resources and improve the roster. Aside from the obvious talent improvement that would come with an established Ace, such an acquisition would also create more competition among the rest of the roster’s pitchers, as there would be one less spot in the rotation available. This competition would be great for both veterans, like <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8779&amp;position=P">Wade Miley</a> and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=2717&amp;position=P">Rick Porcello</a>, and younger players like Owens and Johnson. Competition breeds improvement, which is sorely needed throughout the Red Sox pitching staff.</p>

Since there is always a give/take, ying/yang, etc. we will cover both ends of the emotional spectrum, but for now let’s start on a positive note and take a look at three areas of organizational strength that can be built upon going forward.</p>
<h2>The Lineup</h2>
<p>It’s no secret that the Red Sox need a good amount of pitching improvements if they want to contend in 2016 and beyond. The everyday lineup, however, appears to be in very good shape as currently constituted. Five Red Sox posted an OPS right at or near .800: <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=745&amp;position=DH">David Ortiz</a> (.913), <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8370&amp;position=2B">Dustin Pedroia</a> (.797), <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=13611&amp;position=OF">Mookie Betts</a> (.820), <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=12984&amp;position=OF">Jackie Bradley Jr.</a> (.832), and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=11982&amp;position=1B">Travis Shaw</a> (.822). Additionally, the Red Sox as a team <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=bat&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=0&amp;type=8&amp;season=2015&amp;month=0&amp;season1=&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0,ts&amp;players=0">finished among the Major League leaders</a> in several offensive categories including:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6<sup>th</sup> in Batting Average &#8211; .265</p>
<p>5<sup>th</sup> in OBP &#8211; .325</p>
<p>7<sup>th</sup> in Slugging &#8211; .415</p>
<p>4<sup>th</sup> in Runs Scored – 748</p>
<p>4<sup>th</sup> in RBI &#8211; 706</p>
<p>6<sup>th</sup> in wOBA &#8211; .321</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pretty impressive. Keep in mind that all of this was accomplished despite two of the lineup’s alleged staples – <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8001&amp;position=SS">Hanley Ramirez</a> and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=5409&amp;position=3B">Pablo Sandoval</a> – were worse than replacement level and a complete drain on the offense. The Red Sox had a top-6 offense in the baseball in 2015, with potential to be top-3 in 2016.</p>
