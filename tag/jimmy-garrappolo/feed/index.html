<p>Who is the favorite to win Super Bowl 51? New England? Seattle? Who is the smart pick? Dallas or Oakland? Is there a longshot team that could upset the chalk for the Lombardi Trophy? Maybe the New York Giants are the underdog pick? <a href="http://www.betphoenix.ag/news/nfl/super-bowl-51-picks-10108" target="_blank">Read more&#8230;</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Tom Brady is officially free.  After Serving his four game suspension, Brady is set to start Oct<a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2016/10/03/brady-is-back/brady-4/" rel="attachment wp-att-87959"><img class="alignright wp-image-87959" src="https://i1.wp.com/sportsofboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brady.jpg?resize=247%2C164&#038;ssl=1" alt="Brady" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/sportsofboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brady.jpg?resize=451%2C300&amp;ssl=1 451w, https://i1.wp.com/sportsofboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brady.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/sportsofboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brady.jpg?resize=200%2C133&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/sportsofboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brady.jpg?resize=130%2C86&amp;ssl=1 130w, https://i1.wp.com/sportsofboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brady.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 247px) 100vw, 247px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>ober 9<sup>th</sup> against the Cleveland Browns.  The fans are excited, the players are excited, and I’m sure Tom himself is thrilled to be back on that field with his teammates.  During Brady’s absence, the Patriots posted a 3-1 record with back up quarterbacks Jimmy Garrappolo and Jacoby Brissett.  If you told me at the beginning of the season that Garrappolo would get hurt and the Patriots would still be 3-1, I wouldn’t believe you.  People were definitely a little nervous about how they would play without Brady but as a team they exceeded expectations.  Yes, it would have been great if they beat Rex Ryan and the Buffalo Bills yesterday and went 4-0 but unfortunately Garrappolo wasn’t healthy enough to play and Brissett looked a little banged up to.  Honestly the whole team didn’t look ready to play yesterday which is unusual to see from the Patriots.  Don’t get too happy though Rex, Brady and the Patriots will be back looking for Revenge on October 30<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>In my mind I think Garrappolo not starting yesterday is a little bit of a disappointment.  Look I’m not a doctor, nor have I had that injury before but I feel like if you want to become an elite Quarterback in the NFL you have to try and play through that injury.  There were some reports that the Patriots were trying to push him to play the Thursday night game against the Texans, which I thought was unrealistic because that was only four days after suffering that injury.  After rehabbing for two weeks though, I thought he was going to play.  He was practicing throughout the week and throwing the ball pretty well.  Playing through injuries show toughness in a Quarterback and it’s usually the elites one that do it.  For example, Brady has played with that injury, Russell Wilson played through an injury this week, and Big Ben always it’s a little knocked up but most of the time he’s out there playing.  Again, I don’t know how bad the injury was but it would’ve been good to see potentially your future Quarterback showing some toughness.  This was also his last chance to really show the league what he can do.  Now unless Brady gets injured, which would absolutely be devastating, who knows when Jimmy will get his next shot to prove to the league how good he is.</p>
<p>It’s only Monday, but I’m sure me and thousands of Patriots fans already can’t wait for next Sunday.  Bradys back, Ninkovich is back, and hopefully the real Gronk is back.  Good luck Cleveland, your going to need it.</p>
