Trade this pick for an established superstar?  Draft ANOTHER young player who won&#8217;t pan out for the next 3-5 years?  It must be tough to be Danny Ainge this time of year.</p>
<p>Danny Ainge has a reputation around the league of getting the best of trades.  I challenge anyone to give me a trade that Danny has lost.  Every blockbuster trade that has involved The Celtics the last few years have been in their favor, and it&#8217;s not even close.  The Kevin Garnett trade, the Ray Allen trade, the Brooklyn trade, the Rondo trade, even the Jeff Green trade.  All trades that have benefited The Celtics and hurt their trade partner.  If Danny is going to make a big splash this offseason, he&#8217;s going to have to talk someone else into giving up a superstar caliber player.</p>
<p>With Ben Simmons and Brandon Ingram likely being off the board when the Celtics select.  Danny&#8217;s first action should be looking for a trade.  Guys like, Jimmy Butler, Paul George, and Demarcus Cousins have been all the talk around Boston.  All of these guys will take a king&#8217;s ransom to acquire, but for the right deal they could all be in green next season.  What should Danny be willing to give up?  With all these players and picks he has acquired through the years it&#8217;s time to cash in, in other words if Indiana wants this year&#8217;s pick, next year&#8217;s Brooklyn&#8217;s pick and Jae Crowder then you do it.  It&#8217;s time for this &#8220;Fireworks&#8221; statement to be true.</p>
<p>If there is no trade to be made before or on draft night and Ainge is forced to take a player, he has to take someone who can help this team sooner rather than later.  Jamal Murray from Kentucky would be my pick at number 3.  Murray who is 19 years old could be a star in the league someday, standing at 6&#8217;5 he could be a 2 guard and a small wing player.  Murray seems like the guy who wants to take the big shot, who wants the ball in crunch time.  Last season he averaged 20 points, 5 rebounds, and just about 3 assists on the season.  His best basketball moment came on the international stage.  In the 2015 Pan Am games Murray was playing for team Canada.  In a game against the USA, Murray was scoreless through the first 3 quarters, but then exploded in the fourth.  Scoring 22 points while dishing out 6 assists in the fourth quarter he led Canada to a 111-108 win over the USA.  This is the type of player the Celtics need.  Murray can take over a game and would be a great compliment to Isaiah Thomas.  If you&#8217;re not going to trade the pick than Murray is the guy to go after.</p>
<p>The NBA draft is June 23rd.</p>

<p>Danny Ainge, after the game, said, &#8220;this team did not play to their potential,&#8221; which he was absolutely correct about.  This quote is coming from the president of basketball operations.  We all know Danny &#8212; he wants to win now, and he would trade every guy on this roster with the exception of Thomas for a bonafide superstar.  (...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2016/04/30/celtics-season-in-review-big-changes-on-the-horizon/">Celtics Season In Review: Big Changes On The Horizon?</a> (623 words)</p>

The C&#8217;s came out of the gate hot and held command of the lead for a majority of the game, but failed to execute and score over big stretches of the second half.  Although Isaiah Thomas did his best to will the team to victory despite a poor shooting night and some crucial misses at the free throw line, his late effort was not enough and the Celtics fell. The heart and grit of this group is displayed by their tenacious defensive intensity, but what the team lacks is a go-to scorer &#8211; someone they can give the ball to in the post and confidently say &#8216;go get me a bucket big man&#8217;. With an ace like that the Celtics could become elite team and a real contender in the Eastern Conference.</span></p>
<p>Trade speculation has been buzzing around big-time NBA centers including Dwight Howard, Brooke Lopez, and DeMarcus Cousins, and the Celts have been tied to almost all of the rumors. The question remains whether Danny Ainge is ready to make that kind of deal, which would undoubtedly require separating with some very valuable assets. Rumor has it that Ainge has expressed interest in such a deal, but has been unwilling to accept a trade that includes Marcus Smart or the Brooklyn Nets&#8217; 2016 1st round draft pick that was acquired in the trade involving Pierce and Garnett. This is a fair assessment by Ainge as that selection has a chance of becoming a number one overall and Marcus Smart has shown tremendous promise. It is clear that Ainge does not consider Smart on the trade block, but that 2016 draft pick deserves some reconsideration.</p>
<p>The obvious top pick in this year&#8217;s draft class is LSU&#8217;s freshman phenom Ben Simmons. Anyone that watched he and the Tigers dismantle Kentucky on Tuesday got to see the superior talent level and athleticism that has NBA general managers salivating. After him on the in the top five of the mock draft board are Brandon Ingram (Duke), Kris Dunn (Providence), Jaylen Brown (California), and Ivan Rabb (California). Although all these players are certainly talented and may blossom into quality NBA starters, none of them seem to address the Celtics&#8217; needs other than Simmons.</p>
<p>The chance of the Nets&#8217; pick becoming #1 overall is 15.9% as of January 7th and the chance of it being in the top 3 is 46.9%. And keep in mind, every time the Celtics continue to lose to the Nets decreases that probability. Drafting Ben Simmons would be ideal for any team because the potential he offers, but acquiring him is far from a sure thing at this point for the Celtics and the lucky team that gets the number one overall will also need to demonstrate patience as the youngster develops.</p>
<p>It seems like given the circumstances and the current Celtics roster trading that Nets&#8217; unprotected draft pick could be beneficial to the Celtics if it is dealt for the right guy. Of the three aforementioned centers on the market the easy name to cross of the list is the plague of the NBA &#8211; Dwight Howard. But both Brooke Lopez and DeMarcus Cousins are interesting and offer intriguing options that deserve some consideration. Here is a career comparison of the two.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two other important elements that need attention are health and character, which are both important when analyzing these two options at center. With DeMarcus Cousins the main concern is his attitude, as he has a history of clashing with coaches and quitting on his teammates. For Brook Lopez it is his injury history that includes foot and ankles problems that often become a chronic hinderance for many big men. Other than those two concerns both players statistical output have been fairly comparable over their careers, with DeMarcus having an advantage on the offensive end. </span></p>
<p>The answer here is DeMarcus Cousins. He is younger than Lopez, has not had the scary injury history, and has shown flashes of defensive ability to go along with his offensive skill set. As previously mentioned the concern is about Cousins&#8217; character, which is a valid source of anxiety and skepticism. But the leadership role on the Celtics that Isaiah Thomas has assumed, and his friendship with Cousins that was developed during their time playing together for the Sacramento Kings offers some optimism. This relationship could harness Cousins&#8217; potential and influence him to buy into Coach Stevens&#8217; system. Sure it is not an absolute certainty, but the presence of Thomas along with leaders like Jae Crowder and Avery Bradley could simmer Cousins&#8217; attitude and allow him to blossom on in team-oriented environment.</p>
<p>With the addition of an elite center the Celtics would be a real contender in the Eastern Conference. Brooke Lopez&#8217; health concerns are not worth giving the Nets back their first round draft pick despite his talents, but the promise of DeMarcus Cousins would be. In either case the deal would likely also include a second round draft pick or two, and a player like David Lee to balance each teams&#8217; salary cap. DeMarcus Cousins offers a superstar offensive skill set with defensive potential if he is surrounded by a competitive team that he gels with. This acquisition could move the Celtics one step closer to their championship aspirations. Celtics fan are waiting patiently for this team to turn the corner and although a supreme college talent like Ben Simmons is promising, it will only serve to further delay the winning process. On the other hand DeMarcus Cousins is under contract through 2018 and could propel the club to the next level upon his first day in the green and white. If Ainge wants to win in the near future he will make this type of deal, if not Celtics fans will have to continue to wait patiently for the team to become a legitimate contender for the NBA championship.</p>

Boston came into the game sitting at 10-8 going 2-3 in there last 5 games and in second place in the Atlantic Division behind Toronto. The C&#8217;s put one in the win column taking it to the Kings 114-97 with four Celtics scoring twenty or more points.</p>
<p>Isaiah Thomas, who continues in the starting line up, and Kelly Olynyk, a spark off the bench, each put up 21 points in the victory while Avery Bradley and Jae Crowder both notched 20-point games as well. The Celtics continued their balanced attack and seemed to play everyone with 12 players scoring in the game. Thomas maintained his average as coming into the game he was scoring 20.8 points per game and Avery Bradley knocking in 16.1 per contest. Other key players moving forward include Jared Sullinger and Jae Crowder both averaging double figures and Evan Turner who is close averaging 9.0 points per game adding solid defense and play-making on offense.</p>
<p>Sacramento hasn&#8217;t exactly gotten off to a blistering pace with their 7-13 record however they have been hampered by injury in the form of a back strain for Demarcus Cousins and are now 6-6 in games that he has played in. Cousins, a player much sought after by Danny Ainge and the Celtics this off season, was averaging 28.2 points per game in the contests in which he has been able to play coming into the game against the Celtics. Former Celtics point guard Rajon Rondo was averaging a shade under 13 points and 10.7 assists per game and hoping he and Cousins can get this Kings team out of the basement of Pacific division (Also known as the Golden State division), and at least compete for an eight seed in the wild western conference.</p>
<p>The Celtics were able to hold Cousins to just 16 points and seven rebounds in twenty four minutes of action. Rondo scored five points and dished out eight assists in the loss. Rudy Gay appeared to be the only Kings player to really shine scoring 18 points and ripping down seven boards. Heading into the game most were excited about the match up between the always difficult to handle Rondo and a great defender in Avery Bradley, as well as the rotation of Celtics bigs in the trenches against a powerful low post presence in Cousins. Boston was able to get the best of that match up to get a victory south of the border. The Kings also lost rookie center Willie Cauley-Stein during the game with a dislocated finger, he will be out 4-6 weeks by initial reports.</p>
<p>The Celtics will continue to be without Marcus Smart for the road trip who is missing time due to, to steal a phrase from hockey, a &#8220;lower leg injury&#8221; which in medical terms is a subluxation of the proxmial tibfib joint. Ainge recently said on the Boston SportsHub 98.5 that he will likely be out a few more weeks but is working hard on getting back.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Boston they are a deep team with twelve players averaging over ten minutes per game so the rotation can pick up some slack however Smart&#8217;s spark, athleticism, defense and intensity are hard to match, the Celtics have gone 4-3 in his absence.</p>
<p>The Celtics got a much needed win in Mexico City as the next stretch of games are not any easier. They go on the road to play the new Twin Towers in LaMarcus Aldridge and Tim Duncan in San Antonio and then travel to New Orleans to do battle against Anthony Davis and the Pelicans. After that they will host Jimmy Butler and the Chicago Bulls before the reigning NBA Champion Golden State Warriors, led by MVP Stephen Curry, bring their currently undefeated, high tempo show to Boston next Friday night.</p>
<p>The Celtics will try to continue to grind through this difficult road trip while Sacramento is falling quickly out of contention in the breakneck paced race for the western conference playoffs.</p>

NBA fans around the league are in store for a night of surprise and elation as they watch their favorite teams draft and trade players in hope of assembling a championship caliber team. Tonight is especially exhilarating for Celtics fans. It is very clear Danny Ainge plans to actively seek trades, and he has openly stated that no one on the roster is considered &#8220;untouchable&#8221;. The abundance of draft picks and young talent, retention of coveted trade exceptions, and cap room availability have created a lot of opinions about the potential directions Ainge may pursue. No one knows how the night will unfold, but it sure is fun to speculate.</p>
<p>Many expect the Celtics to trade up for a lottery pick in the draft.

(Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)" ></a><p>I have already stated that I am not sure is DeMarcus Cousins would fit in Boston but I would still take the risk depending on the package Sacramento is looking for. There are a number of things general manager Danny Ainge could do to get Cousins or some other star, given the cap situation and the number of tradable pieces on the books. Quite possibly the best, and least talked about of these assets is the two large trade exceptions Boston has from Tayshaun Prince and Rajon Rondo. These could be huge in a scenario where Ainge goes all in for next season. If he decides to simply use all cap room, trade exceptions, trades and draft picks between now and next year’s trade deadline, there are endless possibilities &#8212; one of which is figuring out a way to bring the Kings big man to Boston.</p>
<p>Cousins is on a great contract, through 2017-18, plays well on both ends of the court (when he wants to) and is possibly the most frightening low post threat in the league. That all sounds great but that last part is what worries me. In an increasingly perimeter oriented league, maybe a guy who plays almost exclusively inside isn’t worth as much as one that can stretch the floor. So there are two questions that need to be answered: Is DeMarcus Cousins worth trading for? And if so, how do you do it?(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/06/09/using-trade-exceptions-and-bringing-boogie-to-boston/">Using Trade Exceptions and Bringing Boogie to Boston</a> (1,453 words)</p>

Lee and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/4240/avery-bradley">Avery Bradley</a> ran a two-man fast break for a couple of baskets, and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/261/kevin-garnett">Kevin Garnett</a> showed no signs of fatigue after logging big minutes in the Celtics&#8217; Sunday win over Miami. Garnett scored 13 points, grabbed 9 rebounds and went 4-for-4 in the early going while battling <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/4258/demarcus-cousins">DeMarcus Cousins</a> down low.</p>
