<p>After giving up 49 points last week The Rams defense was on the ropes, and as a whole I&#8217;m sure they were a team that was looking to get home after back to back games in the pacific time zone.  The Patriots scored on their first possession, a 4th and 1 rush by LeGarrette Blount that went for 43 yards and a touchdown.  Then they scored early in the second on a touchdown pass from Tom Brady to Chris Hogan, however after this the offense hit a wall.</p>
<p>The Patriots average 3.1 offensive touchdowns per game, yesterday they scored 2 and struggled to do so.  Without Gronk the offense doesn&#8217;t thrive like they should.  Not having that big body in the middle of the field hurts them, Gronk is a matchup nightmare, he does things on the football field that most guys can only dream of doing.  The Patriots always preach about finishing drives off with touchdowns, well yesterday they kicked 4 field goals.  When the playoffs come around you have to score touchdowns, not kick field goals.  On the season The Patriots have been stellar on 3rd downs.  They are 6th in the league with a conversion rate of 44.5%.  Yesterday they were 4-12 on third down.  When Brady needs a completion he looks for his hall of fame tight end, and when he&#8217;s not there things change.</p>
<p>The Patriots are still the favorites in the AFC, but without Gronk it levels the playing field.  The defense will have to play more like it did yesterday, and multiple guys are going to have to step up on offense to pick up the slack of Gronk not being there.</p>

(Photo Courtesy of nflspinzone.com)" ></a><p>Labor Day presented good news for Patriots fans, as All-Pro Tight End Rob Gronkowski revealed that he will indeed play in the team’s first game against the Dolphins in Miami this Sunday. Gronkowski is a game-changer who can singlehandedly cause a defense to change what they do. The Past two seasons have been riddled with injuries for Gronkowski, and the the Patriots hope this will be the beginning of a fully healthy season for him.</p>
<h2>Gronk&#8217;s Effect</h2>
<p>With the return of Gronkowski, the Patriots offense will have a much easier time moving the ball against the Dolphins’ defense. Although Brent Grimes is a good cover  corner, he is not built to defend a player like Gronkowski. This task will be left to a combination of Miami safeties and linebackers, none of whom are equipped to do so. After missing the early portion of the 2013 season, Gronkowski returned in Week Seven against the Jets and was targeted 17 times and hauled in eight receptions for 114 yards. In the six and a half games he played in, New England had the top offense in football in almost every statistical category. In his last full season, 2011, he set the record for touchdown receptions by a tight end. The most impressive part of the entire equation is that he is still only 25 years old and getting better.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2014/09/02/yo-soy-fiesta-what-to-expect-from-rob-gronkowski-in-week-1/">Yo Soy Fiesta!
