				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=160231">Chris Crane</a> had his finest game since taking over the quarterback position at BC, throwing for two touchdowns and running for three more, including the game winner with :22 to go, in the Eagles 38-31 victory over NC State.  The win is the first conference victory of the season, evening that mark at 1-1 and pushes the overall record to 4-1.  It is also the second win in as many tries for Coach Jeff Jagodzinski over his predecessor Tom O&#8217;Brien.</p>
<p>In addition to the touchdowns, Crane (34 for 51) threw for 430 yards and ran for 40 of the team&#8217;s 151 on the ground as BC amassed 581 yards of total offense.  The BC offense went three-and-out on the first drive, but scored on their next three to solidify Crane as the quarterback (for this day anyway) and keep the headphones on <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=236575">Dominique Davis</a> for the entire game.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2008/10/05/crane-leads-bc-over-nc-state-with-5-tds/">Crane Leads BC Over NC State With 5 TDs</a> (1,153 words)</p>
