Coming into this All-Star Game, the American League was unbeaten in 13 match-ups (including a tie in 2002), but the National League had the overall better record at 40-38 (2 ties).  Starting for the National League was the Colorado Rockies&#8217; <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=28625">Ubaldo Jimenez</a>, who ended the first half of the season with a 15-1 record and a 2.20 ERA. Opposing him for the American League was the Tampa Bay Rays&#8217; <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=28958">David Price</a>, who had a record of 12-4 and a 2.42 ERA.</p>

Boston&#8217;s other three All-Stars were pitcher <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=28855">Clay Buchholz</a>, second baseman <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=6393">Dustin Pedroia</a>, and catcher <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=5007">Victor Martinez</a>, all of whom were on the DL coming into the All-Star Game.</p>
<h2>The AL Scores First</h2>
<p>In the first half of the All-Star Game, it was all about the pitching, as neither team was able to score.
