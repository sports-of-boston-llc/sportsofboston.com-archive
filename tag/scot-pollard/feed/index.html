				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The token white guy riding the bench through most of the season, Brian Scalabrine will still remain a fan favorite in Boston despite the numbers that he puts up. Although he played a bit more than his white counterpart, Scot Pollard, Scal still did not deliver impressive numbers this season. I understand that if he played more often, his numbers would be better, but lets face it: the Celtics did not need him to play more. Scal did more off the court than on the court to help his team.</p>
<p>Scalabrine&#8217;s final numbers for the season were meaningless averages of 1.8 points and 1.6 rebounds per game. However, Scal was a guy that Doc Rivers could count on to be there when the team needed him.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>KC did <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2008/01/27/celtics-making-the-grade-at-seasons-midpoint/">a piece earlier in the Celtics season</a> in which he reviewed and issued grades for each individual player on the team. Now that the season is over I&#8217;ll take a look at all of the players on the team and give them a grade and a little bit of review on how I believe they performed and what to look forward to from them in the future.</p>
<p>Overall, no one can deny the C&#8217;s an A overall. Winning 66 games in the regular season and then going on to win the NBA Finals is not something to be taken lightly. To win in the fashion that they did earns the team an overall A, no questions asked. Also, I give an A to Doc Rivers and Danny Ainge for putting this team together and creating the greatest single-season turnaround of a franchise in NBA history. They deserve all the credit and accolades they get.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2007/09/01/player-preview-scot-pollard/">high hopes for Scot Pollard</a> coming into the 2007-2008 season. I figured Pollard, penciled in as the No. 2 center behind Kendrick Perkins, would see an increase in playing time from the previous season. As soon as the season really got going, though, I found out that Pollard just isn&#8217;t that good.</p>
<p>Pollard came off the bench very rarely (he played 22 games total), and when he did, it was because the Celtics had all their big man plagued with injury or in foul trouble. He did provide the occasional rebound or blocked shot, which was helpful. But&#8230;his contributions were really meaningless. How so?</p>
<p>With or without Pollard, the Celtics would&#8217;ve won 66 games in the regular season, gone seven games in the playoffs against the Hawks and Cavs, and gone six games with the Pistons and Lakers before winning the NBA title. He was just along for the ride.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that the Celtics regular season is officially over, we can take a look at it overall. Unless you have been living under a rock all of the NBA season, then you know that the Celtics were at least good. They have been better than good and that is exactly why they finished their season off with the third best record in club history at 66-16. There was nothing that seemed to stop the Celtics the entire way through. Just take a look at their monthly records:</p>
<p>November: 13-2, December: 13-1, January: 10-5, February: 9-4, March: 13-3, April: 8-1</p>
<p>Not a bad run at all, especially in their worst month of February when they went Kevin Garnettless for a few games. Besides that the C&#8217;s went without injuries minus the injury that ended Scot Pollard&#8217;s season (they proved they really did not need him though), for  basically the entire season.  There were a few minor scrapes to some players here and there but overall it was a healthy season for Boston.</p>

<li>Is this the Perk we&#8217;ve been waiting for, or is it just a flash in the pan? I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s a little of both. Perk is definitely improving, and KG has a lot to do with that. But, Perk is not Al Jefferson yet, not by a long shot.</li>
<li>It will be interesting to see if Perk can keep this up. I added him to my fantasy team just in case this is a lot more than just an aberration.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Celtics have played 41 games. They have remarkably won 34 of them. Thus, it should come as no surprise that the Celtics midseason report card will feature many outstanding grades. Let me start by giving <strong>Danny Ainge and Doc Rivers each an A</strong> for their outstanding performances. Danny gets the mark for bringing in all this talent and transforming the team, and Doc gets the &#8216;A&#8217; for making this all work. Now, allow me to present the (mostly good) grades for the first half of the 2007-2008 NBA season.</p>
<p><strong>REPORT CARD<br />
</strong>Rubric: Grades for all players will be based on their performance statistically this season and how they performed vs. my projections. Grades will be just like a report card with comments on how the player has performed and if they can improve.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kevin Garnett<br />
Grade: A<br />
</strong><br />
Actual 2007-2008 Stats:</p>
<table class="projection" width="353">
<tr>
<th>PLAYER</th>
<th>MIN</th>
<th>PPG</th>
<th>RPG</th>
<th>APG</th>
<th>BPG</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kevin Garnett</td>
<td>35</td>
<td>19.2</td>
<td>9.9</td>
<td>3.8</td>
<td>1.4</td>

<p>Preseason Projected Stats:</p>
<table class="projection" width="353">

<p>Comments:  Garnett has been everything the Celtics have asked for and more. His numbers may be down when compared with his career averages and my projected numbers from before the season, but he has undoubtedly been the glue for the team when they needed it most. Take example from Friday night&#8217;s game against Minnesota. He left the game in the fourth quarter with a painful abdominal strain, but returned and sealed the deal with a game-winning steal. His tenacious style and absolutely intense demeanor just gets everyone, fans included, jacked up for the entire game. His defensive presence has been outstanding, as the Celtics have allowed the least amount of points in the NBA, and have the largest average point differential. I have zero complaints about Garnett&#8217;s game. (Cross your fingers that his injury is not serious!)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Celtics easily handled the washed-up Kings, combining stifiling defense with uncanny 3-point accuracy in an 89-69 drubbing (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nba.com/games/20071226/BOSSAC/boxscore.html">NBA.com Box Score</a>). Ray Allen led 5 Celtics in double figures with 17 points, while Kevin Garnett added 14 points and 10 rebounds. James Posey contributed 11 points off the bench in the win.</p>
<p>The old Sacramento Kings (from the Mike Bibby-Chris Webber days) played like the Celtics did last night. Prolific 3-point shooting (usually provided by Peja Stojakovic) combined with strong defense often led to 50-win seasons for Sacramento. It worked for years until the team started breaking down. Last night, the Celtics turned the table, ending an 11-game losing streak in Sacramento.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Here’s the Celtics Four-Point Play to appear every Wednesday on Sports of Boston. This is where I will compile four (4) small and related Celtics facts and offer my own spin on a variety of Celtics news stories. The general format will be a short blurb about the story first, then my reaction tabbed underneath it.</em></p>
<p>1. From the Boston Globe: &#8220;The Celtics picked up guard Rajon Rondo&#8217;s option for the 2008-09 season on Tuesday. Rondo will make $1.2 million this season and $1.3 million next season.&#8221;</p>
<ul>
<li>The C&#8217;s were facing the deadline in which an NBA team can pick up team options on recently-drafted players. The C&#8217;s smartly grabbed Rondo for an extra year at only $1.3 million, which should prove to be a bargain. After 2008-09, Rondo will be due a much larger payday.</li>
<li>One guy that has the potential for a big future payday is Tony Allen, whom the Celtics declined to extend probably because of his horrific knee injury suffered last season while attempting a dunk. Tony is coming off knee surgery and the C&#8217;s wisely decided to sit back and wait it out with him. If the injury never occurred, I guarantee the C&#8217;s would&#8217;ve picked up the option.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to Celtics.com&#8217;s Peter Stringer, center Scot Pollard has returned to the practice court following a left ankle injury. Yeah, I&#8217;m talkin &#8217;bout practice.</p>
<blockquote><p>Reserve center Scot Pollard took to the practice floor Monday for the full session, and he was upbeat about returning to action, noting that he was taking &#8220;baby steps&#8221; toward being ready to go for Friday&#8217;s season opener against the Wizards.</p>
<p>Pollard sprained his left ankle during workouts before training camp, so Monday was his first official practice with the Celtics.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m obviously not in basketball shape but it was good to get out and run around and actually be a part of the team on the court,&#8221; Pollard said. &#8220;Hopefully, knock on wood, we&#8217;re past the point of [my ankle] reacting a huge amount.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Probably more known for his hairdos than his ability as an NBA center, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/players/stats?statsId=3189">Scot Pollard</a> brings the Celtics added muscle to the front court. The eccentric 6&#8217;11&#8221; big man was signed August 7 to a one-year deal at the veteran minimum ($1.0 million), a few days after Danny Ainge completed the deal for star forward <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/players/profile?statsId=3007">Kevin Garnett</a>. Pollard will bring a <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?statsId=5981">Kevin Millar</a>-type persona to the locker room and should be a quote-machine all year long for the press.</p>
<p>He may be most-remembered for an incident late last season in which he was not suited up for a game against the Pacers. With the camera on him, Pollard said, &#8220;Hey kids, do drugs.&#8221; Pollard was disciplined by the Cavs, and later apologized admitting it was a &#8220;bad joke.&#8221; He continued, &#8220;That&#8217;s all it boils down to. There are a number of things people could say about it, but it just turned out it was a bad joke. Obviously, I don&#8217;t believe that.&#8221;</p>
