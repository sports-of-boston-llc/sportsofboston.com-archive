He celebrates this one with Julian Edelman. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer)" ></a><p>One of the best things about being a Patriots fan is having this luxury of knowing you&#8217;re going to the playoffs every year. Even more than that, you&#8217;re probably going to watch your team in the AFC Championship just like the past four years. In only week eight, the Patriots have basically wrapped up the AFC East. After emasculating the Dolphins on Thursday night they now have wins against each of their AFC East opponents. What&#8217;s more impressive is that score could have been a lot worse. The offense left a lot of first half points on the field as the defense was shutting the Dolphins down. That&#8217;s really nitpicking though as 36 points is nothing to bat an eye at.</p>
<p>&#8211; I genuinely hope everyone watching is really appreciating what Tom Brady is doing this season. What he&#8217;s doing at 38 years old is nothing short of amazing. On Thursday he went 26-38 for 356 yards, with four touchdowns and no interceptions. That brings his totals on the year to 2,410 yards with 20 touchdowns and only one interception that came off a bobbled pass from Julian Edelman. He&#8217;s on pace to throw over 5,500 yards, about 47 touchdowns, and maybe have three interceptions. He&#8217;s more focused than he&#8217;s ever been and it was never more apparent than on one play in the fourth quarter. With the game already in hand with a score of 29-7, Brady took a sack after missing a read. He then slammed the ball and his fist in frustration. Even though the game was already over Brady wasn&#8217;t satisfied. He wants to leave no points on the field. Tom Brady wants to win this season more than he wants anything in the world and I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anyone out there who can slow him down. (...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/11/02/notes-and-observations-week-8-patriots-virtually-clinch-afc-east-in-36-7-win-over-dolphins/">Notes and Observations, Week 8: Patriots Virtually Clinch AFC East in 36-7 Win Over Dolphins</a> (1,046 words)</p>

The Dolphins don&#8217;t have the same talent across the board as the Jets, but they have two elite players in Cameron Wake and Ndamukong Suh. Suh is an excellent interior lineman when he has his head in the game and will be a handful for the Patriots interior offensive line. However, it is Wake who could end up being more of a problem for New England.</p>
<p>Wake already has six sacks this season and the Patriots are hurting at offensive tackle. If Marcus Cannon cannot play, then the starting tackle opposite Sebastian Vollmer will be Cameron Fleming. Miami will likely try to match-up Wake with Fleming as much as possible making this battle of the &#8220;Cams&#8221; important to the outcome of the game. When teams have beaten a Patriots offense in the last 15 years they have generally done three things&#8221; get pressure up the middle, have a good edge rusher, and cover well. Miami is not great in coverage but definitely checks off the other two boxes. If the Patriots line gets beat off the ball consistently, then Tom Brady will not have adequate time to defeat the Dolphins coverage. The battle around the edge is especially important because Brady struggled in the first half against the Cowboys this season and excellent edge rusher Greg Hardy.</p>
<p>Wake is a superior player to Fleming, but Fleming held his own last week against the Jets. The Patriots will also try to help Fleming out by chipping Wake off the edge with running backs and tight ends. Even so, there will be instances where the young tackle has to block Wake one on one. Wake has shown that when he gets going, he can have a monster game. His four first half sacks against the Titans changed how Tennessee played that game and he could do the same to the Patriots.</p>
<p>Miami could move Wake around and have him face off with Vollmer, but the better match-up for them is Fleming. If Marcus Cannon plays he will not be 100% and signs are pointing to the possibility of him sitting out. There is a strong possibility that Fleming will once again be forced into the starting role.  If that is the case, the match-up between the two &#8220;Cams&#8221; could decide the game.</p>

Running lanes were not open and Tom Brady had little time to throw and was constantly under pressure. These deficiencies led to a 2-2 start that had some clamoring for the early beginning of a new era in New England.</p>
<p>Once October began, the offensive line troubles for the Patriots began to disappear. The unit gelled and new starter Bryan Stork solidified things at center. In the nine games from early October until late November the Patriots averaged 304 yards passing per game and 114 yards rushing a game. In the first four games of the season (original protection issues) and the last two (problems resurfacing), the Patriots have averaged 249 yards passing and 107 yards rushing per game. The rushing yards are comparable but the passing yards have represented a significant drop off with the protection issues.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2014/12/24/patriots-offensive-line-problems-beginning-to-resurface/">Patriots Offensive Line Problems Beginning to Resurface</a> (245 words)</p>

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa)" ></a><p><span style="color: #222222;">It never gets old winning the AFC East. At the start of every year, we have to listen to all the &#8220;experts&#8221; talk about how the Bills, Dolphins, and Jets are all primed to challenge the Patriots for the division crown. Granted the Bills actually have an impressive defense, and if they only had a legitimate quarterback they might pose a challenge int he future. But every year in December it&#8217;s the Patriots who sit atop the AFC East and remind everyone that it is still their division to lose. This of course is just the first goal of every year for them. The ultimate is still winning the fourth Lombardi Trophy in February. </span></p>
<div style="color: #222222;">&#8211; I&#8217;ve compared this team to the 2003 team on a couple of occasions, and Sunday&#8217;s win was very reminiscent of their 31-0 win over the Bills in week 17 of that season. As you may remember the Bills embarrassed the Patriots in week one by the same 31-0 score. It came after Belichick cut long time captain Lawyer Milloy and the critics hounded Belichick for the way he coached his team. Similarly this year the Dolphins made it look easy in an upset win during week one of the season. Then the Dolphins did what the rest of the AFC East does when they beat the Patriots, <a style="color: #1155cc;" href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/12/15/patriots-drew-inspiration-from-dolphins-words-after-week-one/related/" target="_blank">they opened their mouths</a>. The Patriots used the remarks as bulletin board material, and they clearly didn&#8217;t quit in the second half as they outscored the Dolphins 27-0. Sunday was a friendly reminder that if anyone is trying to unseat the Patriots they&#8217;ll have to pry it from Brady and Belichick&#8217;s cold, lifeless fingers.</div>

Photo Courtesy of The Denver Post." ></a><p>When the NFL schedule was released in April, it was evident that the Patriots would have to battle through a tough stretch from late October through mid-December. That stretch began with a blowout home win against a Chicago Bears team that has talent but that has not lived up to expectations. The Patriots followed that with their most impressive win of the season, a 43-21 beat down of the Denver Broncos. This weekend they will have an opportunity to rest as they are on a bye. The stretch will ramp back up after this weekend.</p>
<p>The next game up for the Patriots will be a trip to Indianapolis to face the Colts. Andrew Luck is already an upper echelon quarterback and is becoming an elite signal caller. The Colts offense is red hot and Lucas Oil Stadium is one of the tougher NFL venues to play at. That game is followed by a home game against the Detroit Lions. Detroit has surprised many by consistently winning this season (6-2) and by being able to rattle off a 3-0 record without Calvin Johnson.

Just like last year they had a lead at the half only to be outplayed in every aspect of the game in the second half. The only consolation you can really take out of Sunday&#8217;s game is the last two times the Patriots lost the season opener, 2001 and 2003, they won the Super Bowl in both seasons. </span></p>
<div style="color: #222222;">With that said let&#8217;s jump right into the talk of the town and that&#8217;s the atrocious play of the offensive line. Sure the Belichick haters will chalk this up to the recent trade of Logan Mankins, but if you honestly think that Mankins, who left his own game with a knee injury, was going to make the difference yesterday then you clearly weren&#8217;t paying attention.</div>

<p>Early in the game, Revis lined up on the left side of the defense and stayed there. The Patriots played a lot of zone early, with Revis covering anyone who lined up against him instead of following one receiver consistently. On the final play of the first quarter, Revis was in coverage on a first down reception by Mike Wallace. As the game progressed, Revis played more physical against the Miami receivers.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2014/09/07/how-the-patriots-used-darrelle-revis-in-week-1/">How The Patriots Used Darrelle Revis in Week 1</a> (308 words)</p>

Gronkowski is a game-changer who can singlehandedly cause a defense to change what they do. The Past two seasons have been riddled with injuries for Gronkowski, and the the Patriots hope this will be the beginning of a fully healthy season for him.</p>
<h2>Gronk&#8217;s Effect</h2>
<p>With the return of Gronkowski, the Patriots offense will have a much easier time moving the ball against the Dolphins’ defense. Although Brent Grimes is a good cover  corner, he is not built to defend a player like Gronkowski. This task will be left to a combination of Miami safeties and linebackers, none of whom are equipped to do so. After missing the early portion of the 2013 season, Gronkowski returned in Week Seven against the Jets and was targeted 17 times and hauled in eight receptions for 114 yards. In the six and a half games he played in, New England had the top offense in football in almost every statistical category. In his last full season, 2011, he set the record for touchdown receptions by a tight end. The most impressive part of the entire equation is that he is still only 25 years old and getting better.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2014/09/02/yo-soy-fiesta-what-to-expect-from-rob-gronkowski-in-week-1/">Yo Soy Fiesta!

How did they respond? They let a very winnable game slip away to a division rival who is making a late season playoff push of their own. Since the Bengals lost as well, the Patriots hang on to the number two seed for now. The loss makes the game next week against the Ravens, a team making a late season surge of their own, a must win.</p>
<p>&#8211; Starting off, tons of credit has to be given to the Miami Dolphins. They played a great football game. Ryan Tannehill was terrific and on point with his receivers all game. It wasn&#8217;t that the Patriots defenders were blowing coverage. For the most part the defenders were right on the Miami receivers, Tannehill was just putting the ball where only his receivers could make a play on the ball. Some great sideline catches were thrown in, and that&#8217;s how Tannehill finished 25-37 for 312 yards, three touchdowns and a QBR of 120.6. The Dolphins simply made more plays than the Patriots and that was the difference in a close divisional game.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2013/12/18/notes-and-observations-week-15-patriots-let-one-slip-away-against-dolphins/">Notes and Observations, Week 15: Patriots Let One Slip Away Against Dolphins</a> (1,248 words)</p>
