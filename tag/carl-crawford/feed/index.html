PHOTO:  Luis Sinco (Los Angeles Times)" ></a><p>Carl Crawford. Four time All-Star, Gold Glove winner, and a very rich man. Once one of the most dynamic players in Major League Baseball during his tenure in Tampa Bay, he was ripe for the taking in 2011. Naturally, a team with deep pockets signed him to a huge contract: 7 years, $142 million.</p>
<p>That team that signed him was the Boston Red Sox. Crawford hardly lived up to his money, with a slash line of .260/.292/.419 during his time in the Northeast. These are the numbers of a less than mediocre player, not a superstar. We all remember what happened next: the Red Sox found a team to dump the salaries of Adrian Gonzalez, Josh Beckett, and Crawford, which was worth $262.5 million.</p>
<p>The Red Sox acquired five players from the Dodgers in the trade, and none became everyday players. However, with all the freed cash, the Red Sox signed clubhouse leaders such as Jonny Gomes, Shane Victorino, and Mike Napoli.</p>
<p>So what has become of those three huge names to leave Boston in 2010? Josh Beckett has since retired, Adrian Gonzalez is a fan favorite/very productive player, and Carl Crawford was designated for assignment two days ago. Unless a team signs Crawford in the next week or so, the Dodgers are prepared to eat the $35 million remaining in his contract.</p>
<p>Who got the better end of the deal? Most would argue that Boston did, as this decision was largely financial, and Gonzalez could not handle playing in Boston. The Red Sox would go on to win the World Series in 2013, and the players they signed with the money saved with this trade were a large part of the reason why. Los Angeles is still a team wallowing in mediocrity, and have not advanced past the NLCS since 1989.</p>
<p>So, best of luck to Carl Crawford as he moves into a life without major league baseball, and best of luck to the Los Angeles Dodgers&#8217; front office the next time someone offers to dump salaries onto them.</p>

<p>So what will these two huge signings bring to the Red Sox over the next several seasons? Sandoval is 28 and Ramirez is 30 years old, they aren’t spring chickens anymore, but they aren’t anywhere near 40 either. To help inform how these two players will help the Sox over the next few years, I’ve looked at each player’s stats from 2011 to 2014.</p>
<p><b>Pablo Sandoval: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Has averaged 130.75 games played per season over last four years</li>
<li>157 games played in 2014</li>
<li>His four year batting average is a .288</li>
<li>Averaged 16.25 home runs per season, hit 16 out of the park in 2014</li>
<li>OBP is .341 over last four years, but 2014 was the lowest at .324</li>
<li>OPS is .798 over last four years, but is trending in the wrong direction</li>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I hate this trade for both sides.

There&#8217;s no guarantee that Lester sticks around beyond October.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Red Sox would be absorbing a contract that owes Kemp $107 million from 2015-2019 (unless the Dodgers are willing to eat a big portion of the deal).(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2014/07/27/red-sox-dodgers-trade-rumor-jon-lester-for-matt-kemp/">Red Sox &#8211; Dodgers Trade Rumor: Jon Lester for Matt Kemp?</a> (277 words)</p>

<p>Lester is set to become a free agent following the 2014 season, in which he will have the ability to sign with any team that offers him a contract, which means that his time in the Red Sox organization could be coming to an end. The 30-year-old pitcher was drafted by Boston in the second round of the 2002 amateur draft, and has been at the heart of their two most recent World Series championships.</p>
<p>Lester has also conquered his fair share of demons off of the diamond. During the 2006 season, he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. His recovery was inspirational as he returned to the major leagues as soon as the 2007 season. On the other end of the spectrum, Lester was <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2011/10/12/beckett-lackey-lester-drank-beer-played-video-games-ate-fried-chicken-during-games/">at the center of the chicken-and-beer fiasco a few years ago</a> when the clubhouse fell apart. The native of Tacoma, Washington has known no other baseball home than Boston, making this impending free agency crucial for his legacy as one of the greatest Red Sox pitchers of all-time.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2014/07/18/red-sox-face-dilemma-with-jon-lester/">Red Sox Face Dilemma with Jon Lester</a> (283 words)</p>

In doing so, they forfeited a guaranteed 1-year $14.1 million deal to test the market. This does not mean these players will not be on the Opening Day roster next year, but it does somewhat clarify the Red Sox&#8217;s offseason plan. Since this is only the second offseason in which the qualifying offer rule has been in play, it is probably best to understand what this rule does.</p>
<h2>What are Qualifying Offers?</h2>
<p>Up until late November of 2011 there were three types of free agents: Type A, Type B, and everyone else. Under this system, if the Red Sox offered arbitration to their Type A free agent and that player signed elsewhere, the Red Sox would gain the other team&#8217;s first round draft pick and a compensatory pick. For Type B free agents the Red Sox would only receive a compensatory pick.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2013/11/12/trio-of-red-sox-decline-their-qualifying-offers-what-happens-now/">Trio of Red Sox Decline Their Qualifying Offers; What Happens Now?</a> (625 words)</p>

Now in his 7th MLB season (all with Boston) Ellsbury has proven himself as one of the best defensive players in the league and having a quality defender in center is vital. He is one of the leading base stealers not only in total steals, but also in percentage. Catchers and pitchers can&#8217;t stop Ellsbury even when they know he&#8217;s going. Simply put, he&#8217;s a game changer.</p>
<p>Ellsbury gives himself plenty of opportunities to use that speed too. He is a consistent .290-.310 hitter in the big leagues who has also reached base in exactly 35% of his career plate appearances. His 32 homerun power from 2011 hasn&#8217;t quite come back, but he is still capable of reaching double digit home runs. Plus, the Red Sox wouldn&#8217;t be paying him for homeruns, they are just an added bonus. He will make the big bucks due to his fielding, running and batting average. When Ellsbury is healthy and hot, a case for him can be made as an elite contact hitter with decent pop in the prime age of his career.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2013/08/27/why-the-red-sox-need-to-re-sign-jacoby-ellsbury/">Why the Red Sox need to re-sign Jacoby Ellsbury</a> (634 words)</p>

<p>Crawford began his career in quiet Tampa Bay, where the media coverage is minimal. He typically didn&#8217;t have to face the music too often with the media during his time there, even if he struggled at the plate.</p>
<p>That all changed in Boston, where he signed a $142 million deal with the Red Sox before the 2011 season. Any struggles were magnified because of his high-profile contract and the escalation of media attention in the big city.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2013/03/08/carl-crawfords-comments-about-boston-media-far-from-the-truth/">Carl Crawford&#8217;s Comments About Boston Media Far From the Truth</a> (332 words)</p>

Even though a lot of money was spent for Dice-K, it was all worth it at the time because the Sox desperately needed an ace in the rotation. I was excited when the Sox signed Matsuzaka because of the hype surrounding him and his mythical pitch, the gyroball. Did I ever imagine six years later that Dice-K would be signing a minor league deal with the Indians? Not at all.</p>
<p>Looking at his time with the Red Sox, Matsuzaka only had one terrific season, in 2008, when he went 18-3 with a 2.90 era, 154 strikeouts, and a 1.32 WHIP. But in his first season with the Red Sox, Dice-K was still impressive, finishing with 201 strikeouts and a 4.40 ERA. After that, though, Dice-K had a rough time in Boston, finishing with an 8.28 ERA in his final season last year.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2013/02/17/will-the-red-sox-miss-daisuke-matsuzaka/">Will the Red Sox miss Daisuke Matsuzaka?</a> (276 words)</p>
