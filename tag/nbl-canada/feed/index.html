As surprising as it may be, the country has never had a national basketball league. The league currently has seven teams, located in large cities like Halifax and Quebec City, mid-sized cities like Oshawa and London, and smaller cities like Moncton (population: 97,000) Saint John (90,00), and Summerside (14,500). This is a very modest beginning, but this league could eventually rise to become a viable alternative to the NBA. What chance does this league have to thrive and what impact will it have on the NBA?</p>
<p>Fledgling professional leagues need to start very small if they want to eventually thrive, so the NBL seems to be starting off correctly. They can build slowly, because Canada has shown the ability to support a variety of professional sports. The NHL and the CFL are of course the most notable examples. There are a number of large cities that can support basketball, and they all have large hockey arenas. Those arenas need to be filled on off nights, and if the NBL plays its financial cards right, it could find a home in every city with an NHL team. The crown jewel of this effort would be Vancouver, which lost the Grizzlies for reasons other than an inability to support the team. If Vancouver can handle the NBA, it would be a huge addition to the NBL.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2011/09/03/a-challenger-from-the-north/">Does the NBA Have a Challenger From The North?</a> (724 words)</p>
