The game concludes a week that included two days of joint practices. Tom Brady and the Patriots offense shined throughout the two sessions that both teams called valuable. As with the first preseason contest, tonight will feature limited time by the starters with backups playing most of the game. With that in mind, here are five players to watch tonight:</p>
<p><b>Chris Harper- </b>The rookie wide receiver out of Cal will likely get a lot of chances tonight with Julian Edelman, Brian Tyms, and Aaron Dobson all dealing with injuries. He has looked solid in camp and has come on strong as of late and was productive in joint practices while working with Jimmy Garoppolo. The 5&#8217;11&#8221;, 175 pound Harper has also had some punt return opportunities in camp.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon Bolden/ James White- </strong>Bolden and White have been battling throughout camp to fill the third down back roll that was left open by the departure of Shane Vereen. Bolden is stronger, but White has more speed and quickness. White played in last Thursday&#8217;s preseason opener and looked like a player ready to take on the third down role. Bolden has the advantage that he plays on special teams, but if White has another strong outing he could put himself firmly ahead of Bolden.</p>
<p><strong>Malcom Brown- </strong>The rookie first round pick is one of several options to fill the middle of the defensive line after Vince Wilfork signed with Houston this offseason. Pairing Brown with 2014 first round pick Dominque Easley is something the Patriots hope to do for the next several seasons.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Garoppolo- </strong>The potential of Garoppolo starting at least one game this regular season has been well documented. What the Patriots need is for Garoppolo to have a strong game and continue to build toward his possible regular season action. He looked shaky in the first half against Green Bay last week but improved as the game went on. A more consistent performance will help both the Patriots and the young quarterback going forward.</p>

Photo courtesy Patriots.com" ></a><p>The Patriots added eleven players over the weekend during the NFL draft. They also added several undrafted free agents after the conclusion of the draft Saturday night. Early on, the Patriots went with a defensive focus with their first four picks (and seven out of eleven total picks) were on that side of the ball. New England spent all of their offensive picks on day three, picking two guards and a tight end. One long snapper was also picked by the team.</p>
<p>With the loss of Darrelle Revis and Brandon Browner this offseason, the Patriots have chosen to invest more in their front seven and hope to generate pass rush to force turnovers instead of forcing coverage sacks and turnovers due to lock down secondary play. This shift began with Revis and Browner leaving, continued with the Jabaal Sheard signing, and was added to on draft weekend. Three of the Patriots first four picks were defensive lineman or pass rushers including first round pick Malcolm Brown. Brown, a behemoth defensive tackle out of Texas, should instantly contribute to the Patriots interior pressure on both passing and rushing downs. Dominque Easley is a bit of a wild card, if he can come back healthy in 2015 he and Brown could combine to create a young, formidable defensive tackle duo. Defensive end Geneo Grissom, a third round pick, is somewhat comparable to Jamie Collins, a high level athlete who couldn’t quite find a niche on a college defense. He is not as talented as Collins, but could add some depth behind the Patriots budding star linebacker. Trey Flowers could end up being a steal at defensive end as well. He was picked at the top of the fourth round and very well could end up going at the end of the second or in the third.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/05/05/patriots-2015-draft-picks-review/">Patriots 2015 Draft Picks Review</a> (454 words)</p>
