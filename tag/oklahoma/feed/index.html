(AP Photo)" ></a><p>1. <strong>LSU</strong><br />
How vast is the talent gap between Alabama and Western Kentucky? Did LSU even have to try this week? Whoever scheduled that game is brilliant. The Tigers absolutely needed some rest after the massive clash two weeks ago.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Oklahoma State</strong><br />
As much as I would love for losses by the top teams to create enough BCS chaos to topple the system, at this point in the season LSU and OSU are pretty definitively the top teams in the country.</p>
<p>I absolutely want them to play in the BCS Championship. It will be a fantastic matchup – offense vs. defense, SEC vs. Big 12, semi-irrational fiery coach vs. semi-irrational laid-back coach.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Alabama</strong><br />
I watched Roll Tide/War Eagle a few days ago, and the Iron Bowl is more ridiculous than I realized. I’ve never been to Alabama, but if I go I will have to declare a side before I cross the border. I’m leaning toward Auburn. Any opinions for or against this would be greatly appreciated.</p>

How dare they give up points to the then-17th ranked Florida Gators. I was once again disappointed that they did not get the shutout. With that said, they seem like they’re playing with more than 11 defenders. Their defense is awesome, and I mean that in the most literal sense.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Alabama</strong> (10)<br />
There you go! That’s how you shut a team down! It was Vanderbilt, but still.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Oklahoma</strong> (8)<br />
No team was more elated than the Sooners this week. They absolutely obliterated their highly-ranked arch rivals. More importantly, this game is in Dallas every year. Even though the Cotton Bowl is roughly equidistant from Austin and Norman, doesn’t it seem unfair that they play this game in Texas every year?</p>
<p>4. <strong>Wisconsin</strong><br />
Wisconsin was idle this week, so not much interesting happened this week. How does that different from most weekends in Wisconsin? It doesn’t. Badger slam!</p>

(AP Photo)" ></a><p>1. <strong>LSU</strong> (40)<br />
I was legitimately disappointed that LSU couldn’t hold on to the shutout this week. Kentucky never had a chance against them. Assuming they keep winning, the Tigers’ matchup with Alabama looks like it will be the game of the season. LSU doesn’t have an easy schedule in the interim though, with games with home games with Florida and Auburn sandwiched around a visit to Tennessee that already looks like a trap game.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Alabama</strong> (12)<br />
With a decisive 38-10 win in The Swamp, it’s tough to argue that Alabama didn’t deserve to jump Oklahoma this week. They haven’t been as dominant as LSU this season, but they’ve still been plenty dominant. They have a much easier road to their matchup with the Tigers, playing Vanderbilt, Ole Miss and Tennessee.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Oklahoma</strong> (7)<br />
Wait… Oklahoma beat Ball State 62-6? There’s definitely an argument to keep Oklahoma in the No. 2 spot. Voters, what’s the hurry to have SEC schools jump in the rankings each week? They’re eventually going to play each other, why can’t we just let that happen?</p>
<p>4. <strong>Wisconsin</strong><br />
WHAT A WIN. The Badgers absolutely dominated a really good Nebraska squad, propelling themselves into the BCS Championship picture and propelling Russell Wilson into Heisman consideration. The only ranked opponent left on their schedule is Illinois (way to go Big Ten!), although they will probably play a ranked Michigan squad in the Big Ten Championship. All things considered, they have a soft road to an undefeated season. Even if that happens though, they’ll need some help. Assuming they also win out, the LSU-Alabama and Oklahoma-Oklahoma State winners will be ranked higher than an undefeated Wisconsin team at the end of the season. The Badgers need one of those teams to lose another game.</p>

(US Presswire)" ></a><p>1. <strong>LSU</strong> (42)<br />
Not even one week can go by without LSU being involved in a rankings flip-flop with another winning team. It was justified this week though. Their defense is truly terrifying, and their team speed causes problems all over the place. I still have trouble believing Les Miles can win another BCS Championship, but there’s so much talent on this team that even he might not be able to screw it up.</p>
<p>2.<strong> Oklahoma</strong> (12)<br />
Even though they dropped to No. 2, the Sooners didn’t have a bad week. They had a strong win over a very good Missouri team, and absolutely look like they could win the BCS Championship as well. Landry Jones is a legitimate NFL quarterback, and that is the biggest difference between Oklahoma and LSU. LSU barely has a college quarterback.</p>
<p>However, the most important development for the Sooners this week was Florida State’s loss to Clemson, which dealt Oklahoma’s strength of schedule a blow. They’ll be able to make it up in the Big 12, especially with the game against Oklahoma State. At this point though, LSU has done more to prove that they are the No. 1 team in the country.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Alabama</strong> (5)<br />
Let’s not forget Alabama. They had an overwhelming win over then-No. 14 Arkansas. Nick Saban’s teams are always really good, and in many seasons this team could make a claim to be the top team in the land. At the very least, they have been as impressive as Oklahoma.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Boise State</strong> (1)<br />
Didn’t they do the exact same thing last week? Am I really supposed to differentiate between a 41-21 win over Tulsa and a 40-15 win over Toledo? Since there isn’t a new angle on BSU’s cool efficiency, let’s discuss something else. During the weeks of speculation about which school would end up in which conference, Boise State was not even mentioned in passing, let alone as a legitimate option. Why were the Broncos left completely out of the conference realignment picture?</p>

With the win over Florida State, Oklahoma took three first place votes each from Alabama and LSU. They also looked like a team that could win the BCS Championship. Great analyst that I am, I believe they are a really good football team.</p>
<p>2. <strong>LSU</strong> (14)<br />
After their win over Mississippi State definitively proved that they are probably one of the best gulf coast schools this year, LSU once again jumped Alabama. These two have leaped each other every week, with the team who beat a higher ranked opponent taking the No. 2 spot each time. This week might put that trend to the test though, with LSU playing No. 16 West Virginia and Alabama playing No. 14 Arkansas.</p>
<p>If both teams win and Alabama jumps LSU, I might need to track one of these voters down. For an interview of course.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Alabama</strong> (7)<br />
LSU has looked better than Alabama this season, but the Crimson Tide has still looked dominant. Alabama is outscoring its opponents 116-18 this season, which includes a win at then-ranked Penn State.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Boise State</strong> (2)<br />
40-15 over Toledo? Business as usual. Kellen Moore completing 79 percent of his passes this year? Also business as usual. I champion America’s Team every week because of this devastating efficiency. Don’t let their isolation among the potatoes or lack of BCS conference affiliation sway you. They are really good.</p>

(Getty Images)" ></a><p>1. <strong>Oklahoma</strong> (32)<br />
Without a game this week, the Sooners became the first school to be ranked No. 1 in 100 AP polls. That achievement has very little bearing on this year’s team, but it impressive nonetheless. Good for them. They have a massive game at Florida State Saturday, and with a win they could make the claim that they deserve to be a unanimous No. 1.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Alabama</strong> (9)<br />
After a predictable game with Penn State, Alabama jumped back over LSU. They don’t play each other until Nov. 5, and it seems very possible that they will jump each a couple more times without either team losing a game, thus giving another example of just how subjective these polls are. If nothing else, the voters must have terribly short memories, “LSU beat a Top 5 team, but Alabama beat a Top 25 team more recently, so they must be better!” Why did they even vote LSU No. 2 last week?</p>
<p>3. <strong>LSU</strong> (17)<br />
After a bye week against Northwestern State this week, the Tigers play five ranked teams in their next seven games. Along with the normal SEC gamut, they have to go to West Virginia. This might be the most exciting stretch of Les Miles blunders in his entire career.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Boise State</strong> (2)<br />
With no game this week, the Broncos were not in the public consciousness. This hurts them more than any other team, because they weren’t able to put an exclamation mark on their win over Georgia. The other teams in the Top 5 all have games against other teams in the Top 5, while Boise State only has maybe-ranked TCU left on its schedule. With the persistent doubt they face, they won’t have many opportunities to wow the country, so they need to grab onto every opportunity they get. With a bye week this week, they lost all the momentum they gained from their win in the Georgia Dome. Basically, the odds are stacked so far against Boise State that they not only need to go undefeated to make the BCS Championship, they might want to think about doing away with bye weeks as well.</p>

(Scott Threlkeld/The Times-Picayune)" ></a><p>1. <strong>Oklahoma</strong> (32)<br />
The Sooners opened with a convincing win. It was nothing spectacular, but they didn’t have anything to fear from Tulsa. They just went about their business, and now they can prepare for the huge matchup with Florida State next week.</p>
<p>2. <strong>LSU</strong> (17)<br />
After winning the opening weekend’s marquee matchup, it’s tough to deny that LSU deserves to be the No. 2 in the country. With another tough non-conference matchup with No. 19 West Virginia in a few weeks, they already control their own destiny. If they win out, they are almost guaranteed to make the BCS Championship. Relying on Les Miles to guide his team through an entire season unscathed is a precarious proposition, but at least the team has started out strong.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Alabama</strong> (9)<br />
LSU played Oregon while Alabama played Kent State. No Crimson Tide fan should be upset about being leapfrogged by LSU. There’s no strong argument against it. Even if there was, these two teams play each other, so it doesn’t really matter. That’s down the road though, and Alabama goes to No. 23 Penn State this week. It will be a great game, and it should be played in black and white.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Boise State</strong> (2)<br />
America’s Team continued its “We Belong” tour this week with a sound drubbing of the Georgia Bulldogs, whose uniforms were sponsored by Satan. More importantly, Boise State’s BCS Championship hopes were dealt a blow when TCU lost to Baylor, thus weakening Boise State’s strength of schedule and potentially robbing them of a second marquee win down the line. If you have any doubts about how convoluted the BCS is, know that Boise State went into a hostile SEC dome in what was essentially a true road game, drubbed a ranked SEC team, and still had to worry that they might fall short this season because of a game in Waco the night before.</p>

However, from a fan’s perspective they are very helpful and give a moderate idea of what to expect from the coming soon.</p>
<p>Here’s this year’s preseason AP Top 25:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Oklahoma</strong> (36)<br />
Landry Jones leads an impressive passing attack that could be the highest-scoring in the nation. They are the consensus No. 1, but they have a tendency to underwhelm, so don’t be surprised if they have a hiccup at some point this season. Oklahoma State who is No. 9, is the best bet to beat them. OSU will be hosting the Bedlam Series this year, and there’s nothing they would enjoy more than destroying Sooner dreams.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Alabama</strong> (17)<br />
Nick Saban’s teams consistently find themselves in the top 5. Once again, they are a legitimate contender. They are more than capable of winning the BCS Championship, if they can get out of the SEC West. As a division it will have more depth than most conferences.</p>
