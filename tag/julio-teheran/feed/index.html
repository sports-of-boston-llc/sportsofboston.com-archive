The heralded ace David Price has been good this season with a 7-3 record and 91 strikeouts, but his 4.63 ERA leaves plenty of room for improvement. Then there is Steven Wright, who has unexpectedly taken over the second spot in the rotation through his stellar consistency. The knuckle ball profile fits more in the middle to back end of a pitching staff, but Wright&#8217;s impressive performance and lack of a viable alternative have propelled him to the front in the rotation.</p>
<p>Rick Porcello follows Wright in the rotation. The twenty-seven year old had an exciting start to the season but has since seen his ERA creep over four in June, which lends itself to some concerns. The return of Eduardo Rodriguez is a welcome addition and can help boost the rotation if he performs, but doubts about the overall quality and depth of the pitching staff are imminent.</p>
<p>After Price there are some critical questions that need to be addressed, and it begins with Steven Wright. Is he really a top two starter for a potential division winner? There is no doubt he has been outstanding this year, the most consistent pitcher on the team, but the unreliable nature of the knuckleball is a tad concerning. It would behoove the Red Sox to see an emergence from either Porcello or Rodriguez as consistent performance from one of these two traditional pitchers would help stabilize the top of the rotation and ease any excessive expectations of Steven Wright.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with the rotation is the vacancy left by disastrous seasons from both Clay Buchholz and Joe Kelly. Buchholz has the potential to rebound from his demotion to the bullpen if he can find his command, but Kelly on the other hand is a lost cause. Even worse, in his last start with Pawtucket Kelly left the game after four and two thirds innings with an apparent groin injury.</p>
<p>Thanks to the friendly nature of the Red Sox schedule until mid June, John Farrell announced that he will employ a four man rotation until June 18th. At that point he wants someone to grab the role of fifth starter and demand that spot through their performance. This offers an opportunity not only to the incumbents Buchholz and Kelly, but also Henry Owens and Roenis Elias whom have both spent most of the season in Pawtucket.</p>
<p>If these problems with the pitching staff are not addressed from within the organization the front office will have to make a trade. This is potentially problematic because the market for quality pitching at this season&#8217;s trade deadline appears minimal. The two top options are Sonny Gray of the Oakland Athletics and the Atlanta Braves&#8217; Julio Teheran, both of whom will demand a healthy package of top prospects in return.</p>
<p>In an ideal world the team will find a resolution from within the organization, but earlier this week Dave Dombrowski announced he is looking for both starting and relief pitching help before the August 1st deadline. It remains to be seen how the situation will unfold, but pitching is a key element of success for any baseball team and Red Sox could use some help both in rotation and the bullpen as they prepare for a pennant race and playoff run.</p>
