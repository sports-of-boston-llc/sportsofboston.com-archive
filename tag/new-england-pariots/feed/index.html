<p>After giving up 49 points last week The Rams defense was on the ropes, and as a whole I&#8217;m sure they were a team that was looking to get home after back to back games in the pacific time zone.  The Patriots scored on their first possession, a 4th and 1 rush by LeGarrette Blount that went for 43 yards and a touchdown.  Then they scored early in the second on a touchdown pass from Tom Brady to Chris Hogan, however after this the offense hit a wall.</p>
<p>The Patriots average 3.1 offensive touchdowns per game, yesterday they scored 2 and struggled to do so.  Without Gronk the offense doesn&#8217;t thrive like they should.  Not having that big body in the middle of the field hurts them, Gronk is a matchup nightmare, he does things on the football field that most guys can only dream of doing.  The Patriots always preach about finishing drives off with touchdowns, well yesterday they kicked 4 field goals.  When the playoffs come around you have to score touchdowns, not kick field goals.  On the season The Patriots have been stellar on 3rd downs.  They are 6th in the league with a conversion rate of 44.5%.  Yesterday they were 4-12 on third down.  When Brady needs a completion he looks for his hall of fame tight end, and when he&#8217;s not there things change.</p>
<p>The Patriots are still the favorites in the AFC, but without Gronk it levels the playing field.  The defense will have to play more like it did yesterday, and multiple guys are going to have to step up on offense to pick up the slack of Gronk not being there.</p>

Tommy, Tom, Tom. We had a good fight, didn&#8217;t we? We ruffled some feathers, tangled with authority, and left nearly no stone unturned in an effort to clear the name of the greatest quarterback of all-time. But in the end, there was nothing even the GOAT himself could do to combat the outright hypocrisy and lunacy of one Roger Goodell. The battle to prove Tom&#8217;s innocence was underhanded and unfair from the jump, and I for one think it&#8217;s time to move forward with Garappolo under-center for weeks 1-4.</p>
<p>When this whole Deflategate fiasco began some 543 days ago, it appeared as though Tom Brady would have an opportunity to prove what he has maintained since day one&#8211; that he had no knowledge regarding the deflation of footballs during the 2014 AFC Championship game. Throughout this exhausting legal process, it started to become clear that Tom&#8217;s innocence would have no bearing on whether or not his suspension would be eradicated.</p>
<p>What became the harsh reality for Tom and the rest of Patriot Nation was that Roger Goodell, the tyrant, set himself up with absolute, unbounded power when the CBA was put into place a few years back. Due to this stranglehold, Goodell was able to flip Brady&#8217;s case completely upside down and make it about his right to enforce his discipline regardless of a player&#8217;s innocence, or any other factor for that matter. Essentially, if Roger Goodell doesn&#8217;t like the way you cut your hair, he can suspend you for three games. If Goodell thinks you made fun of his hair piece behind closed doors, that&#8217;s four games.</p>
<p>This coming from a man who refused to acknowledge the facts (video evidence) that Ray Rice knocked his fiancee unconscious in an elevator. A man who has turned a blind eye to domestic violence, performance enhancing drugs, and several other infractions that have had a MUCH larger effect on the reputation and integrity of his game than an ALLEGEDLY deflated football used in a game that the Pats won by 38 points.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve said all along, the Brady suspension is a blessing in disguise for the Pats. Tom will have an extra four games of rest, and he will come back to a bevy of talented receivers DYING to catch passes from one of the best to ever lace them up. The extra rest will be huge for Brady and the Pats come playoff time. In addition, it will give the Pats a chance to showcase Jimmy Garappolo, who is nearing the end of his rookie deal and could be used as a trade chip moving forward with a solid performance in the first four weeks.</p>
<p>So enjoy the extended vacation with your super model wife and millions and millions of dollars, Tom. We&#8217;ll be ready for you to return week five and drop a 50 burger on those poor, poor Cleveland Browns. WE STAND WITH TOM.</p>

<p><strong>Miami Dolphins</strong></p>
<p>The Dolphins who finished 6-10 last year seem to always have potential to challenge, or make the Pats look over their shoulder.  However they can never fulfill this potential.  With Adam Gase as the head coach, a lot of Dolphins fans are excited.  Ryan Tannehill is young and should keep improving, their defense can be really good, and they have one of the best play makers in the NFL in Jarvis Landry.  The Dolphins could be a surprise in the East. With that said I have them at 7-9.</p>
<p><strong>Buffalo Bills</strong></p>
<p>Buffalo finished with a 8-8 record last season.  However, they were really in the hunt all season.  Tyrod Taylor should improve, and as much as I hate to say it Rex Ryan is a good defensive head coach.  They really need a good season from their receivers for a chance to contend. I have the Bills at a solid 9-7.</p>
<p><strong>New York Jets</strong></p>
<p>Yes the hated Jets.  They posted a 10-6 record last season, and had a chance in the final game of the season to secure a playoff spot.  Yet they lost the game in typical Jets fashion, they do have momentum coming into this season.  They have a win now kind of roster, and need to pony up the money and pay Fitzpatrick.  Todd Bowles is a good head coach and could steer the Jets into a wild card spot this upcoming season.  Jets will have another 10-6 season.</p>
<p>All three of these teams could have good seasons for their standards.  None of them will be able to really compete with The Patriots at the end of the day.  Even if Brady is suspended.  Patriots go 13-3 and will get the number 1 seed in the AFC.</p>

<p>Since Belichick was hired he&#8217;s been to 6 super bowls and 10 conference championship games.  Yes having Tom Brady helps, but no team in history has been able to sustain success like Bills Patriots have.  Belichick is so great for many reasons, but his greatest attribute is knowing when to let go.</p>
<p>Players like Lawyer Milloy, Richard Seymour, Deion Branch, Ty Law, Vince Wilfork were all players that Belichick had to make a tough decision on.  No, all these players weren&#8217;t just cut off the team, some were free agents who Bill saw decline in.  I&#8217;m sure Belichick loved all these players, but when a younger and more importantly cheaper player comes in and can do the same job, Bill seems to go that route.</p>
<p>Belichick has done a lot for The Patriots organization, this team was nothing without him.  Yes Brady has helped, but Belichick&#8217;s drafting, developing, decisions and most importantly him being the general manager are all things that most other coaches can not do.</p>
<p>When he is all done coaching he will go down as the Greatest Coach Of All Time.</p>

And guess who they ranked number one? Yes, our New England Patriots.</p>
<p>I was actually blown away when I saw this for a couple reasons. One being that ESPN has constantly covered everything and anything bad they hear happening with the Patriots. Including covering every waking second of Deflategate. From the rants I&#8217;ve seen on that show, I don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s too many Pats fans over there at ESPN which is why I&#8217;m surprised they ranked them at the top seed. But that&#8217;s just my bias opinion. And two, mainly because Tom Brady apparently won&#8217;t be playing until the fifth week due to his Deflategate suspension.</p>
<p>Even though Brady is most likely not going to play for the first four games of the season, do not count them out. From the looks of it most people would say that the Patriots have done a very good job this off season with the draft and free agent pick ups. Here are some new notable players to keep an eye out for this upcoming season:</p>
<h2>New Players to Keep an Eye On</h2>
<ul>
<li>TE Martellus Bennett</li>
<li>WR Chris Hogan</li>
<li>G Jonathan Cooper</li>
<li>DE Chris Long</li>
<li>WR Nate Washington</li>
<li>CB Cyrus Jones</li>
<li>DT Anthony Johnson</li>
</ul>
<p>It looks like the Pats and Jimmy Garoppolo have their work cut out for them as they play in Arizona against the Cardinals for Game 1 of the season. But Patriots fans do not worry. We have one of the most diverse and intricate running games in the league along with many different running backs of all shapes and sizes. Our wide receiver positions just got even stronger with the adds in of Nate Washington and potential slot receiver Chris Hogan. The Pats have arguably the best tight end scheme in the entire NFL with Rob Gronkowski and Martellus Bennett. They have improved their defense with add ins at the LB, DT, and CB positions. The biggest question Patriots fans are left with is, can the offensive line protect the quarterback?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know I&#8217;m not a doctor, but I sure hope so.</p>

<h2>Take the Washington Redskins (+7) over the Seattle Seahawks.</h2>
<p>Washington is going to help redeem my debacle of a pick Monday night. The Skins are hosting the Seahawks on Monday Night Football this week, and Washington will be coming off 10 days of rest, (Seattle off a bye).(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2014/10/04/2014-nfl-betting-tips-week-5/">2014 NFL Betting Tips: Week 5</a> (493 words)</p>

Tonight, the New England Patriots will be traveling to play at a hostile environment against the Kansas City Chiefs, and I believe the Pats at -3 are a steal. I believe this line should be New England -6, so this betting spot should be taken advantage of by the betting world, (especially in the New England area).</p>
<p>The Pats have looked sluggish through the majority of the season other, with week two being an exception. New England only beat the lonely Oakland Raiders 16-9 last week at Gillette Stadium, but I think that poor performance is just what the doctor ordered for the Pats.</p>
<p>There is no way that Bill Belichick will allow his team to have another lackluster performance after what they displayed against the Raiders. New England will be paying attention to detail, (especially on the offensive side), as I believe tonight’s game is the most difficult test they have faced the first four weeks of the season. There have also been stories about tonight’s game being the loudest Chiefs home game in their franchises history. It is always tough to win a game at Kansas City, but New England will lean on their stingy defense, as they have all season. The Pats have had to lean on their defense, as the offense has been pitiful to put it nicely. The New England defense is the reason why they have a 2-1 record. The Pats defense has struggled in stopping the run, and the Chiefs will most likely have their most dangerous weapon back in running back Jamaal Charles, which on the surface looks like it could be problematic for New England. I believe the Patriots will do as good job in limiting Charles production and leaving the game into Alex Smith’s hands. I think Tom Brady will take advantage of a depleted Chiefs defense, and will turn red zone drives into touchdowns rather than field goals. The New England offense is going to propel them to a 30-21 victory tonight.</p>
