A highly touted infielder for his natural athleticism and raw power, Chavis has yet to live up to the high expectations.</p>
<p>He has a balanced stance from the right handed batters box with his hands steady at shoulder level, and starts his swing with a short, quite stride. He unleashes his hands through the zone with impressive bat speed and scouts regard his raw power potential.</p>
<p>Growing up Chavis played primarily shortstop but when he was draft it was unclear whether he would stick at the position long-term. Last season Red Sox management decided to move him to third-base on a permanent based on their projection of Chavis&#8217; player profile. Unfortunately this transition has not gone smoothly as hoped.</p>
<p>In 39 games at the end of 2014 in rookie league with the GCL Red Sox, he had a decent performance but was not overwhelming. He spent time at both shortstop and third-base in that campaign and posted a respectable .767 OPS with one home-run and 16 RBI.  His trouble was in the field as he made seven errors in 39 games. Then last year, with the class-A Greenville Drive, he seemed to regress further. In 68 games at the hot corner he made 19 errors resulting in a dismal .907 fielding percentage. Chavis needs to work on his technique at the new position and it must be addressed if he wants to progress as a professional, but it is a skill that he can explicitly focus on and improve if he puts in the hard work.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the 20 year old prospect is heralded for his ability to hit the long-ball. Last season with the Drive he hit 16 home-runs and posted an impressive .182 ISO. The concern however is his approach in the batter&#8217;s box; although he hit those home runs, he appended the power output with a lousy 67% contact rate and 6% walk rate. This led to a disquieting .223/.277/.405 slash line.</p>
<p>In his limited professional exposure there are no doubts about Chavis&#8217; power, but the lack of plate discipline and feel for the strike-zone leave more to be desired. This is an aspect of baseball that does not come naturally to many but often improves as players accrue more plate appearances. It clicks for some prospects and not for others so by no means a presumed outcome for Chavis. He really needs to address this facet of his offensive toolbox if he wants to keep up his prospect stock.</p>
<p>Chavis is remains a young prospect very early in his development and despite last year&#8217;s struggles has plenty of time to improve upon the flaws in his game. Raw power is a valued tool in the baseball industry and there is no doubt he has it. 2016 is an important year for him as a professional and he needs to establish himself as a contributor in the Greenville lineup.</p>
<p>He remains years away from a debut at Fenway Park and hasn&#8217;t earned spotlight recognition from Red Sox Nation, but prospect junkies will be sure to have an eye on him in the next few of years. If he addresses the holes in his game and develops as a player I will expect to see him at Hadlock Field by late 2017 or early 2018.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Recently, Jacoby Ellsbury has gained a negative reputation because of his rib injury.  Is Red Sox Nation being too harsh on him? Who is really responsible for shedding this negative light on the swift outfielder?]]></description>

<p>For those who don&#8217;t believe in Ellsbury and his passion for the game, <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=8289923">take a look at this video</a>.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind, Ellsbury made this catch just days after returning from the DL for his hairline fractured rib cage.  He knew he wasn&#8217;t completely healed, and he still took the field.</p>
<p>Does that really look like a guy that doesn’t want to play?  That catch, from a less-than-100% Ellsbury, is more effort than we would have seen from a Manny Ramirez at 200%.  And not once have we ever seen Ellsbury sneak into the Green Monster to take a leak, either.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/06/04/is-jacoby-ellsbury-the-new-manny-ramirez/">Is Jacoby Ellsbury the New Manny Ramirez?</a> (474 words)</p>

<p>The group, led by Red Sox owner John Henry and celebrity fans such as Ben Affleck and Denis Leary, among others, made an anonymous bid of over $100 million per season.</p>
<p>Yankees owner George Steinbrenner accepted the bid, reportedly without realizing that it was from the Red Sox fan organization. According to unnamed sources, when Steinbrenner signed the contract, he was under the mistaken impression that he was actually signing an agreement to once again hire Billy Martin to manage the Yankees.</p>
<p>Members of the Red Sox group have not yet officially announced what they&#8217;ll be naming the Stadium this season, but they are mulling over several ideas.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/04/01/red-sox-nation-buys-naming-rights-to-new-yankee-stadium/">Red Sox Nation Buys Naming Rights to New Yankee Stadium</a> (185 words)</p>

Nevertheless.</p>
<p>He cites an admittedly bizarre <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2009/07/31/for_legions_of_fans_a_magic_spell_is_broken/">Boston Globe piece</a> that quotes a lot of people having perfectly normal reactions to the news of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/07/30/manny-ramirez-and-david-ortiz-tested-positive-for-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-2003/">David Ortiz&#8217;s positive test</a>. The article makes the mistake of interpreting this as some kind of sudden disillusionment with Big Papi, which Drew seizes upon eagerly. As though all of New England is suddenly weeping and gnashing their teeth because of the abrupt downfall of a local hero.  As though we&#8217;re all walking around with black armbands on, where &#8220;real&#8221; (read: Non-Boston) fans would receive such news with the quiet dignity and reason that <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/080209_raidrs.jpg">sports fans everywhere are known for</a>.</p>
<p>I think, all things considered, that the reaction has been anything but naive. Sure, people are pissed and disappointed, but hardly anybody was caught completely off-guard. Hoping that Papi wasn&#8217;t a steroid user isn&#8217;t the same as believing that he isn&#8217;t, and I don&#8217;t think anyone but a few idiots truly believed in their heart of hearts that the big guy was steroid-free.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/08/02/deadspin-your-source-for-witless-misdirected-rage/">Deadspin: Your Source for Witless, Misdirected Rage</a> (251 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every June game for the Red Sox so far has been against a team leading their division at the time: Tigers, Rangers, Yankees, and Phillies. The hometown team has represented themselves very well, going 9-3 (including 5-1 on the road) and winning three of the four series, including two sweeps.  The Red Sox spend the rest of the month on a relative vacation, playing no team above .500 or above fourth place in their division in the Braves, Nationals, and Orioles.</p>
