				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s halfway through the 2008 season and it&#8217;s flown by, at least for this fan/blogger. For this week&#8217;s 2-Point Conversion column I&#8217;ll be taking a look at the two glaring inconsistencies which could keep the Patriots from making a deep run in the playoffs.</p>
<h2>Point 1: The secondary</h2>
<p>There were many different reactions and opinions when the Patriots decided not to show Asante Samuel the money and allowed their shutdown corner to take his act to Philadelphia. I&#8217;ve said in the past that I supported that decision but was cautious on what kind of secondary Bill Belichick would throw out in &#8217;08. Eight weeks into the season we haven&#8217;t seen much more than we expected. Free agent signee Tank Williams and Rodney Harrison have both suffered season ending injuries and some of the veterans brought in to stabilize the corps haven&#8217;t worked out (though Jason Webster is now back in a Patriots uniform), the rookies cannot be expected to significantly contribute, and Ellis Hobbs is not a number one corner.<br />

<p>&#8220;&#8230;.With the 21st pick in the 2006 NFL Draft&#8230;.the New England Patriots select..Laurence Maroney, running back from Minnesota!&#8221;</p>
<p>And so it goes. Maroney became just the second running back taken in the first round by the Patriots since 1991 (the other being Robert Edwards and we all know what happened there). He left Minnesota after his junior year where he rushed for more than 1,000 in each of his seasons as a Gopher. He came to New England to supplement aging running back Corey Dillon and eventually take over the reins as the Patriots premiere running back. With the news Monday that he will be placed on injured reserve, one has to wonder if Maroney will ever have the durability to become a No. 1 tailback in the NFL.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been five weeks now (technically 4 and 3/4) with Matt Cassel at the helm of the Patriots and though it&#8217;s tough for Patriots fans to accept, it seems right now like the Patriots are in their current form a one man team. Would I be writing this if the Patriots had beaten the Chargers or at least had made a game of it? Probably not. But as I said after the Dolphins loss, these kinds of blowouts just haven&#8217;t happened in the Bill Belichick/Tom Brady era. Losses occurred, even lopsided losses, but not to the likes of a 1-21 Miami Dolphin wildcat formation team and an overrated Chargers team (minus Shawne Merriman). The debate can rage on whether Matt Cassel is the answer or if the Pats should have brought in a veteran to manage a game. The fact of the matter is, whoever comes in would not have the impact of Tom Brady. Brady&#8217;s greatness comes more into focus now that he is out, and the growing mediocrity of the rest of the 53-man roster is beginning to look startling.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week&#8217;s 2-point conversion column will focus on the Patriots California dreaming and the Al Davis claim of Randy Moss tampering by Bill Belichick.</p>
<h2>Point 1: Patriots Chillin&#8217; in Cali:</h2>
<p>A long bye week for the 2-1 Patriots leaves the team plenty of time to stew over the embarrassing loss to the Dolphins. As bad as things were it&#8217;s now time to focus on the future which is a two game road trip in California. Back-to-back games against the 49ers and Chargers will see the Patriots stay in California through the second game instead of bringing the team back across the country two more times. The 49ers will not be an easy rebound for the Pats as QB J.T. O&#8217;Sullivan isn&#8217;t as inept as many thought. The &#8216;niners are 2-2 and O&#8217;Sullivan has nearly 1,000 yards and four TD passes thus far. Frank Gore is an elite running back and has &#8211; dare I say &#8211; Ronnie Brown like skills.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>For this weeks column I&#8217;ll be focusing my two points on the fan reaction of Sunday&#8217;s disaster at Gillette Stadium. </em><br />
There was still much of the fourth quarter to go, yet most of the fans were headed towards the exits. The field which has seen multiple AFC championships triumphs in this decade was emptying faster than a Save Matt Millon committee meeting. The Patriots weren&#8217;t beaten, they were humiliated, and by a team who had been 1-21 in their last 22. Against a no name coach (can anyone still name him?) on their home turf, a week after a big statement win over the Jets. After all the success the team has given the fans of New England in the last 7 years, there they were leaving early and booing the team at the end of the game. The players took notice, as both Ben Watson and Ellis Hobbs took offense to the actions of the fanbase.<br />
