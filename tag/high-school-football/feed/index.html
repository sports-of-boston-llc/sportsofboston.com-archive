Strong was the defensive coordinator at the University of Florida for seven years, where in that span, the Gators won multiple National Championships. Strong was a big part of the recruiting machine that was in Gainesville, as he helped bring in the likes of Janoris Jenkins, Joe Haden, Brandon Spikes, Carlos Dunlap and Major Wright &#8212; all players, who compete in the NFL today.</p>
<p>Now, in just his first year with full recruiting leverage, Strong landed arguably the biggest recruit in Louisville football history.</p>
<p>Teddy Bridgewater, a Miami native, was a long-time University of Miami commit, however things changed with the firing of Randy Shannon. Like in many cases when a coach leaves a program, many recruits start to look elsewhere in their college search. Bridgewater proceeded to field offers from big-time football programs in the best overall conference like, Florida, LSU and Tennessee.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/12/22/a-strong-turnaround-louisville-lands-top-recruit-bridgewater/">A Strong Turnaround: Louisville Lands Top Recruit Bridgewater</a> (321 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Friday Night Lights</em> is H.G. Bissinger&#8217;s chronicle of the Permian Panther (located in Odessa, Texas) 1988 season and quest for the state championship. It begins with the preseason and moves all of the way to the playoffs (I won&#8217;t give away how far they get). It was later made into a movie starring Billy Bob Thorton and directed by Bissinger&#8217;s cousin Peter Berg. It was also adapted (loosely) into an NBC drama that has gone on to critical acclaim but little viewership.</p>
<p><em>Friday Night Lights</em> is perhaps the most comprehensive work of sports journalism I have ever read. Bissinger leaves no stone unturned (he devotes an entire chapter to the courtroom drama surrounding Gary Edwards, corner back and running back for the Dallas-Carter Cowboys, the last team the Panthers play, and his questionable grade in Algebra II). Focusing on five primary players- quarterback Mike Winchell, fullback Boobie Miles, tight end Brian Chavez, linebacker Ivory Christian, and tailback Don Billingsley- Bissinger provides a wonderfully in-depth analysis of the relationship between the town of Odessa and its high school football squad and the effect such a relationship has on those who play the game.
