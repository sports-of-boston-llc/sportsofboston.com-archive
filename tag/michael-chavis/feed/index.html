A highly touted infielder for his natural athleticism and raw power, Chavis has yet to live up to the high expectations.</p>
<p>He has a balanced stance from the right handed batters box with his hands steady at shoulder level, and starts his swing with a short, quite stride. He unleashes his hands through the zone with impressive bat speed and scouts regard his raw power potential.</p>
<p>Growing up Chavis played primarily shortstop but when he was draft it was unclear whether he would stick at the position long-term. Last season Red Sox management decided to move him to third-base on a permanent based on their projection of Chavis&#8217; player profile. Unfortunately this transition has not gone smoothly as hoped.</p>
<p>In 39 games at the end of 2014 in rookie league with the GCL Red Sox, he had a decent performance but was not overwhelming. He spent time at both shortstop and third-base in that campaign and posted a respectable .767 OPS with one home-run and 16 RBI.  His trouble was in the field as he made seven errors in 39 games. Then last year, with the class-A Greenville Drive, he seemed to regress further. In 68 games at the hot corner he made 19 errors resulting in a dismal .907 fielding percentage. Chavis needs to work on his technique at the new position and it must be addressed if he wants to progress as a professional, but it is a skill that he can explicitly focus on and improve if he puts in the hard work.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the 20 year old prospect is heralded for his ability to hit the long-ball. Last season with the Drive he hit 16 home-runs and posted an impressive .182 ISO. The concern however is his approach in the batter&#8217;s box; although he hit those home runs, he appended the power output with a lousy 67% contact rate and 6% walk rate. This led to a disquieting .223/.277/.405 slash line.</p>
<p>In his limited professional exposure there are no doubts about Chavis&#8217; power, but the lack of plate discipline and feel for the strike-zone leave more to be desired. This is an aspect of baseball that does not come naturally to many but often improves as players accrue more plate appearances. It clicks for some prospects and not for others so by no means a presumed outcome for Chavis. He really needs to address this facet of his offensive toolbox if he wants to keep up his prospect stock.</p>
<p>Chavis is remains a young prospect very early in his development and despite last year&#8217;s struggles has plenty of time to improve upon the flaws in his game. Raw power is a valued tool in the baseball industry and there is no doubt he has it. 2016 is an important year for him as a professional and he needs to establish himself as a contributor in the Greenville lineup.</p>
<p>He remains years away from a debut at Fenway Park and hasn&#8217;t earned spotlight recognition from Red Sox Nation, but prospect junkies will be sure to have an eye on him in the next few of years. If he addresses the holes in his game and develops as a player I will expect to see him at Hadlock Field by late 2017 or early 2018.</p>
