<p align="left">There&#8217;s a lot to be known of one of the Celtics new acquisitions, Esteban Batista. A lot remains to be seen with him, and he may not even be on the team by the time the regular season starts. There are a few things we do know about the forward/center. He&#8217;s 6&#8217;10&#8221;, and he&#8217;s the first player ever from Uruguay to play in the NBA. Batista potentially could fill a void on the depth chart at the center position. Sure the signing seems good, but why him and why now?</p>
<p>Batista earned a spot on an NBA roster by impressing many this summer at the FIBA Championships in Las Vegas while playing for Uruguay. Batista averaged 20.8 points and a tournament-leading 12.4 rebounds per game. The rebounds were eye-catching, and some teams came calling (Boston, Charlotte, Indiana, Phoenix). It would appear that Danny Ainge feels the Celtics are in need of some big help. Another motive to the signing would be to motivate the guys at the bottom of the depth chart (Jackie Manuel, Brandon Wallace, Gabe Pruitt) that they still have to earn their spot on the team. Batista&#8217;s signing along with Dahntay Jones brought the C&#8217;s to a roster of 17 players, two more than the league maximum.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here’s the Celtics Four-Point Play to appear every Wednesday (I know, today&#8217;s the belated edition) on Sports of Boston. This is where I will compile four (4) small and related Celtics facts and offer my own spin on a variety of Celtics news stories. The general format will be a short blurb about the story first, then my reaction tabbed underneath it.</p>
<p>1. As I reported earlier today (<a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2007/09/27/celtics-get-batista-and-jones/" target="_blank">Celtics get Batista and Jones</a>) and was first reported by the Globe, the Celtics have agreed to deals with Uruguayan center Esteban Batista and swingman Dahntay Jones. Batista played sparingly with Atlanta last season, but his eye-popping performance in the FIBA Americas Championship (a tournament-leading 12.4 rebounds per game) is what made him an attractive free agent on the market. Jones had served as a scorer off the bench during his career with the Grizzles, averaging 7.5 points per game last season.</p>
<ul>
<li>Danny Ainge made a couple of good moves here, bringing in guys to compete for spots in training camp. The two additions bring the Celtics roster to 17, which is two more than the league maximum. So what does that mean for Jackie Manuel and Brandon Wallace? Well, I guess they&#8217;re both going to have to play harder to earn their spots, and they won&#8217;t have to back in. Personally, I see Batista definitely making the team, due to his size and apparent rebounding ability. At 24, he still has time to develop, and may become a solid backup center.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m not so sure about Jones. He&#8217;s a veteran, which gives him the edge right away. I&#8217;d lean towards the former Duke star over Wallace and Manuel, as they both will probably playing for the NBDL this year anyway. Jones is a great dunker, and is probably known for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnP32DhQeSE" target="_blank">his dunk over 7&#8217;6&#8243; Houston center Yao Ming.</a></li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here’s the Celtics Four-Point Play to appear every Wednesday on Sports of Boston. This is where I will compile four (4) small and related Celtics facts and offer my own spin on a variety of Celtics news stories. The general format will be a short blurb about the story first, then my reaction tabbed underneath it.</p>
<p>1. I was poking through the Celtics Blog forums and I saw <a href="http://www.celticsblog.com/index.php?option=com_smf&amp;Itemid=64&amp;topic=10304.0" target="_blank">a post from a guy about a Paul Pierce article</a> he has access to but we can&#8217;t see. Either way, Pierce made reference to the fact that he probably should still be the go-to guy in the final two minutes of games. He also made a bold 60-win prediction (!!!) for the C&#8217;s this season.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>TSN</strong>: Are the Celtics going to The Finals or what?<br />
<strong>PIERCE</strong>: Yeah, why not? See, everybody&#8217;s been asking me about my numbers, but all I&#8217;m thinking about is wins and losses. If we win 60 games and do good in the playoffs and all our numbers are down, we&#8217;ll all be happy. I think we can do it.<br />
<strong>TSN</strong>: Sixty wins? Are you serious?<br />
<strong>PIERCE</strong>: Man, I&#8217;m an optimist.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Wow. I hope KG and Ray Allen don&#8217;t take offense. I guess they shouldn&#8217;t, at least at first. Pierce is the captain and has (obviously) been here longer. So I think he&#8217;s the incumbent go-to guy. That doesn&#8217;t mean Ray Allen can&#8217;t hit a big three when we need it or we cant go down low to KG to stuff it in, but Pierce will be the guy (for now) taking the shots when it counts and (for now) he should be.</li>
<li>As far as 60 wins is concerned&#8230;I just don&#8217;t know. That&#8217;s a LOT of wins. Is this team really 36 games better than last year? Is it 11 games better than the 49-win team from 2001-02? Only time will tell&#8230;check beck next week for my final win-prediction.</li>
</ul>
