In just this month only, David Ortiz passed Mickey Mantle on the all time home run list, Rick Porcello reached 20 wins (21st win Monday), Hanley Ramirez was named AL Co-Player of the week on Monday, and Boston now sits in a comfortable four game lead in the AL East.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t been watching the Red Sox play this month then you&#8217;ve been missing out on some great games. They have been playing superb baseball as the post season is right around the corner. The Sox just came off a four game series sweep on the New York Yankees. A series in which Hanley Ramirez homered four times. The series was started off with a monster three run walk off home run from Hanley himself. He now has 28 homers and 106 rbis on the season. Not only is Hanley hitting timely home runs but he has been <strong>DESTROYING </strong>these home runs. I was at Fenway a week ago when the Sox had a 12-2 win over the Orioles and he hit one of the farthest home runs I&#8217;ve ever seen hit over the green monster. I&#8217;m not kidding, it never came down it just kept going up. I seriously think that ball got lost in Mars&#8217; orbit.</p>
<p>On a side note, after ace Rick Porcello picked up his 21st win Monday night over Baltimore, it seems like he may have locked himself in on the AL Cy Young Award. He now is 21-4 on the season and the only competition behind him is J.A. Happ of Toronto who holds a record of 19-4. But Porcello holds a better, ERA, WHIP, and strike out count than Happ. Boston has 12 games left to play in the season so Porcello should probably get a couple more chances to add some wins to his already stellar record.</p>
<p>All that being said, the Red Sox are HOT right now and it couldn&#8217;t come at a better time in the season. The Sox don&#8217;t show any sign of slowing down and are hopeful to play strong into the playoffs. October baseball is almost among us and I&#8217;m very optimistic for great things coming to the city of Boston in the near future.</p>

<p>Porcello has probably been the quietest winning pitcher in all of baseball. After Friday night&#8217;s game Rick holds a 20-3 record. Not only is Rick the best pitcher in baseball right now but the Sox are now in first place and two games ahead of Toronto in the AL East.</p>
<p>The Sox have been playing very well lately as they have won seven of their last ten games. It looks like Boston is establishing themselves as a dominant team in this league as their hitting and pitching has really come around as the season is nearing an end. But much of that success is due to the tremendous season Porcello has had so far. He has a great chance to take the AL Cy Young Award this year.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to get my hopes up, but with the post season right around the corner, I cannot wait for what October has in store for Sox Nation.</p>

This was their 6th straight win and they have now moved into the top spot in the wildcard. They are now only one game behind Toronto for first place in the division. One of the many reasons the Sox are playing so well is star outfielder, Mookie Betts.  Betts is playing unbelievable right now and definitely should be in discussion for MVP right now. Since August, he has batted .403, with seven homeruns and 20 RBI’s. He had a three home-run game against Arizona on the 14th and a two home-run game against the Orioles on the 16th. The three home-run game was Bett’s second time doing that this season and the first time a Red Sox player has done that since the great Ted Williams. I know that Jose Altuve is having an amazing year, batting .364 for the Astros, but if the Sox make the playoffs and the Astro’s don’t than Betts should hands down get the MVP.</p>
<p>The Red Sox starting pitching has also been a big factor why they have won 6th straight games. In the past seven days the Sox starting pitching has only let up a total of eleven runs. Rick Porcello picked up his 16th win on Sunday, and all season long has given the Sox a pitcher they can rely on. If Porcello keeps pitching as well as he has, he will definitely be in the discussion for Cy young. Rodriguez has also been a nice surprise lately. In the month of August he has an ERA of 2.08. It really seems like he is turning around his season. Unfortunately, on Tuesday, while pitching a no hitter through four innings he had to come out of the game due to injury. Hopefully, this is just something minor and continues to pitch well for the rest of the season.</p>
<p>The Sox have 43 games left and a three game lead in the Wild card standings so as of right now they are in a good position to make the playoffs. I believe that they will and if they don’t I will consider this season a disappointment. Go sox!</p>

The Sox acquired left handed reliever Fernando Abad from the Minnesota Twins in exchange for minor league lefty Pat Light.</p>
<p>Abad will help the Sox&#8217;s struggling bullpen as left handed hitters have only a .163 batting average off him this season. This is not a big trade but will definitely aid the Sox a little with their pitching situation. But the move that everyone was hoping for was to see another stud pitcher in the starting rotation.</p>
<p>Everyone knows Chris Sale was the talk of the deadline but it was no surprise to me that he stayed with Chicago. A dominant pitcher like him is not going to go anywhere without a very large trade being put in place. It&#8217;s a shame the Sox couldn&#8217;t snag him because he is just what we are missing.</p>
<p>However, I have to say I am very surprised Andrew Benintendi and Joan Moncada stayed with the AA Portland Sea Dogs. I expected the Sox to move at least one of them in a trade to acquire a starting pitcher. Now that they are staying in the Sox farm system, I don&#8217;t know what the Sox are going to do with their starting rotation.</p>
<p>The addition of Drew Pomeranz was viewed as a good move at first but is looking a little shaky right now. Steven Wright has had a couple bad starts lately and David Price is still yet to get into a consistent groove. The only consistent pitcher the Sox have right now is Rick Porcello who quietly has been a stud this year with a 14-2 record.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what the Sox are going to do but if they want to be serious contenders for the playoffs, their pitching has to make some adjustments. The AL East and the American League in general is very competitive right now and it&#8217;s really a toss up for which teams are going to win the division and the wild card.</p>
<p>Safe to say this trade deadline helped, but it wasn&#8217;t enough.</p>

<p>June is firmly in the rearview mirror for the suddenly wicked hot Boston Red Sox, and for at least 24 hours, doubts and criticisms have been silenced.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, the Red Sox needed only a one-run home run from Brock Holt to take the victory, but they graciously accepted a three run shot from Big Papi to provide all the run support that Rick Porcello would need. Porcello looked strong, earned his tenth straight win at home, and the Sox shut out the team with the best record in the majors. It was a feel good win, reminiscent of Octobers past, and indicative of Octobers future.</p>

<p>You can make the case that Porcello has been the Red Sox best pitcher so far this season.  He has a record of 11-2, his ERA is 3.66, and he has a WHIP of only 1.17.  These are stats that are much improved from his horrible campaign from last season, to make it worse he signed that 4 year contract worth 82.5 million dollars.  Last season it seemed like Porcello really couldn&#8217;t get a grip of the season, and really couldn&#8217;t figure out Boston.  Maybe that big contract got to his head?  If I had to guess I&#8217;d say yes it did.</p>
<p>This season tho he has been the most consistent pitcher The Sox have.  He has been able to get the tough outs when needed, and has pitched in some really big games this season.  Porcello shows no signs of slowing down, I totally expect him to continue his dominance post all-star break.  Porcello seems like he has more &#8216;guts&#8217; than the other guys on the staff.  With that being said, if the season comes down to one game it should be Porcello on the mound, not David Price.</p>

<p>The Sox have a chance a pretty good chance to bring a decent amount of players to the All-Star game, but it shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise to anyone. The Red Sox are the best hitting team in the MLB. They are first in runs (342), hits (610), doubles (152), total bases (1015), RBIs (329), AVG. (.290), OBP (.355), SLG (.482), and OPS (.837). They lead in almost every major offensive statistic so it wouldn&#8217;t be a shocker if half of the starting lineup ends up All-Stars this season. At one point during the season, six of the nine starting players were batting over .300 which is ridiculous. These guys are proving that they are a dominant force on the offensive side and they are really trying to make a name for themselves this year.</p>
<p>Now their pitching is another story. Everyone knows that Boston&#8217;s weakest part of their game is their pitching. But they do have some solid pitching from David Price, Rick Porcello, and Stephen Wright. If any pitchers from the Sox were going to make the All-Star game, I would have to say it would only be Porcello. He is 7-2 on the season with a 4.04 ERA. But I honestly don&#8217;t think Porcello will make it. If he had another win or two and had a lower ERA then yes he probably would make the team.</p>
<p>This time of year is looking very different from where the Sox were last year. The only player from Boston to make the All-Star game was Brock Holt. Now Holt has been hurt for a while with a concussion so we haven&#8217;t seen him so he&#8217;s out of the question for this year&#8217;s game. But to go from one All-Star to potentially four, five, maybe even six All-Stars in one year is a huge improvement.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how the voting ballots end up and who leads in each category. I want to see our players at the top of the food chain come July. But its up to <strong>YOU</strong> Boston fans to cast your vote and get our boys to the All-Star game. So head on over to MLB.com and vote! You can vote a total of 35 times total and five times a day. If I could vote 35 times a day I would but I also have no life so that&#8217;s just me.</p>
<p>Happy Voting</p>

The Sox, (33-24, T-1st in A.L East), will head back to the Bay Area for the first time since 2013, and will go up against a loaded Giants squad, (35-24, 1st in N.L West), who are one of the top teams in all of Major League Baseball.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday 6/7 @ Giants:</strong></p>
<p>Rick Porcello (7-2 4.00 ERA) vs Albert Suarez (1-1 3.18 ERA)</p>
<p>Players to Watch: David Ortiz and Hunter Pence</p>
<p>Ortiz continues to torch opposing pitchers in his final season with his offensive stats near or at the top of almost every category in the MLB. He is currently batting .340 AVG (4th), with 54 RBIs (1st), and 16 homeruns (T-4th). Pence is having another solid season with the Giants, batting .298 with 36 RBIs and seven homeruns.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday 6/8 @ Giants:</strong></p>
<p>David Price (7-2 4.88 ERA) vs Madison Bumgarner (7-2 1.91 ERA)</p>
<p>Players to Watch: Xander Bogaerts and Brandon Crawford</p>
<p>Each teams left-handed ace will take the mound for the final game of the series, so expect an all out duel on the rubber for this one. On the offensive side, look for shortstops Bogaerts and Crawford to pace the scoring for their respective clubs. Bogaerts is right behind Ortiz in batting average sporting a .345 AVG, good for third best in the MLB, with 33 RBIs and six homeruns as well. Crawford boasts a .247 AVG with 30 RBIs and six homeruns.</p>
<p>First pitch for both games is scheduled for 10:15pm ET.</p>

<p>At 11 games over the .500 mark, Boston can look forward to a 7 game road trip beginning in Toronto for three games, and ending in an extremely important four game showdown against second-place Baltimore. With first place in mind, this is a vital road trip to establish a cushion in the AL East.</p>
<p>Joe Kelly (2-0, 5.28), who shocked a lot of people in his last start (Kelly took a no-hitter into the sixth inning against Cleveland in his first start back from rehab) looks to bump his record to 3-0, after slicing his ERA almost in half last week. Kelly had previously been impressing in Triple-A Pawtucket, but not many could have predicted how in command he would look on the mound. Opposing Kelly, for Toronto, is Aaron Sanchez (4-1, 3.20), who most recently went seven innings in a 9-3 Blue Jays drubbing of the Twins. Sanchez can be expected to go for around six innings, but the Boston bats have silenced more impressive pitchers this season. <strong>Final score: BOS 6, TOR 4</strong></p>

<p>Tonight, Clay Buchholz (2-3, 6.11), backed by an offense that can be downright superb at times, will take on the winners of four straight. The Indians are sitting at 2.5 games behind the White Sox for first place in the AL Central, and they need a solid series in Fenway to stay relevant. The Indians will send out Corey Kluber (2-5, 4.30), who gave up four earned runs in 5.1 innings the last time he faced Boston, on April 5th (Sox won, 6-2). The Red Sox and Indians split two games in Cleveland (as a third was rained out), after Buchholz gave up five earned runs in 4 innings the next night, on the sixth (Cleveland won, 7-6). These are two mediocre pitchers, both with high ERAs. Who will implode first? <strong>Final score: BOS 9, CLE 6</strong></p>
