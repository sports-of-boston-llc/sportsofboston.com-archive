<p>Despite all the money he made, despite all the accolades he received, Nomar&#8217;s career, to me, and I think I speak for all Sox fans in this regard, will be recognized more for what it could have been, than what it was.</p>
<p>There was a time in which Nomar could accurately be described as a more complete player than Derek Jeter.  Of course, at that time, Alex Rodriguez was the best player in baseball (and would be for the next several years) but, between the three of them, they made baseball the best sport in America. In 2014, where the disparity in popularity between baseball and football grows every year, there appears to be something missing from the game that made it the favorite from Generation X to every generation dating back to the Civil War.  Each season, there seemed to be a single compelling narrative which captured the country&#8217;s fascination.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2014/10/05/as-jeter-leaves-lets-reminisce-on-nomar-what-could-have-been/">As Jeter Leaves, Let&#8217;s Reminisce on Nomar: What Could Have Been</a> (718 words)</p>

<p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declared that federal agents were wrong in seizing 104 names from two companies holding the results of a 2003 league-wide drug survey. The agents originally had a warrant to only search for ten names, but collected the others when it was determined that the rest of the names were left in the open.</p>
<p>The Appeals Court made its judgment saying that the seizure of the list was in violation of the fourth amendment of the Constitution. Chief Judge Alex Kozinski said, &#8220;This was an obvious case of deliberate overreaching by the government in an effort to seize data as to which it lacked probable cause.&#8221;(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/08/27/baseballs-2003-steroids-list-taken-illegally/">Baseball&#8217;s 2003 Steroids List Taken Illegally</a> (596 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2009/08/01/ortiz_others_knew_they_were_on_the_list/?page=1">a Boston Globe report</a>, David Ortiz and more than 100 other major league players that tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs in 2003 were told years ago that they were on the list. Despite telling reporters July 30 that the news &#8220;blindsided&#8221; him (which may be true since the report came at such a random time), Ortiz was notified in September 2004, right in the thick of a World Series Championship season, that he was on a list seized by the federal authorities along with the test results.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Ortiz <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/07/30/david-ortiz-issues-statement-regarding-steroids-report/">realeased a statement about the news</a>, and despite knowledge of his appearance on &#8220;the list,&#8221; he maintained he was still surprised: &#8220;Based on the way I have lived my life, I am surprised to learn I tested positive.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the government raid, the commissioner&#8217;s office and the MLB Player&#8217;s Association agreed to notify each of the players that the government believed they had tested positive. So that means <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/02/07/cnnsi-arod-tested-positive-for-steroids-in-2003/">Alex Rodriguez</a>, <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/06/16/sosa-tested-positive-for-steroids-in-2003/">Sammy Sosa</a>, <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/07/30/manny-ramirez-and-david-ortiz-tested-positive-for-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-2003/">Manny Ramirez, and yes, David Ortiz</a> were made aware of their presence on &#8220;the list&#8221; in 2004. That also means that Bronson Arroyo (if he&#8217;s on the list) knows too.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/08/01/ortiz-others-knew-they-were-on-2003-steroids-list/">Ortiz, Others Knew They Were on 2003 Steroids List</a> (258 words)</p>

<p>The biggest problem with the list is that the reports are completely unconfirmed by any major news source.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In another not-so-shocking report, Sammy Sosa &#8211; the man who hit more than 600 career home runs, spent more than 10 years in the league then forgot most of his English while testifying before congress &#8211; tested positive for steroids in 2003.</p>
<p>The now infamous list of players who tested positive in 2003 &#8211; the first year of mandatory drug testing &#8211; now claims A-Rod and Sosa as it&#8217;s two most high profile victims, even though the list was never supposed to be leaked.</p>
<p>Sosa, 40, was part of the great home run chase of 1998 with Mark McGwire. Sosa finished that season with 66 home runs and amassed 609 career homers. He retired earlier this spring.</p>
<p><strong>My Take:</strong> Not a shock, these sluggers from the steroid era just keep dropping like flies. Sosa also had the corked bat incident, so you knew this guy had something fuzzy going on to begin with.</p>
