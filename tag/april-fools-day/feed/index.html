<p>The group, led by Red Sox owner John Henry and celebrity fans such as Ben Affleck and Denis Leary, among others, made an anonymous bid of over $100 million per season.</p>
<p>Yankees owner George Steinbrenner accepted the bid, reportedly without realizing that it was from the Red Sox fan organization. According to unnamed sources, when Steinbrenner signed the contract, he was under the mistaken impression that he was actually signing an agreement to once again hire Billy Martin to manage the Yankees.</p>
<p>Members of the Red Sox group have not yet officially announced what they&#8217;ll be naming the Stadium this season, but they are mulling over several ideas.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/04/01/red-sox-nation-buys-naming-rights-to-new-yankee-stadium/">Red Sox Nation Buys Naming Rights to New Yankee Stadium</a> (185 words)</p>

<p>Walker was originally drafted by the Celtics out of Kentucky in 1996.

<p>Walker&#8217;s return is largely due to his long-lasting friendship with Paul Pierce, who lobbied to Doc Rivers and Danny Ainge to give ol&#8217; number 8 another opportunity.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/04/01/antoine-walker-is-back/">April Fools: Antoine Walker is Back!</a> (145 words)</p>

(Photo from Sports Illustrated)" ></a><p>With the loss of Jason Bay to free agency, the Red Sox thought first about turning to defense. They signed Mike Cameron to patrol center field, moved Jacoby Ellsbury to left field, and signed Adrian Beltre to play third to build one of the best defensive clubs in years. The formula was simple: pitch better, defend better, allow fewer runs.</p>
<p>Then, Theo Epstein realized how ridiculous that sounds. It&#8217;s a game of balance with good pitching, good defense, <strong>and good hitting</strong>. Without Bay and presumable Mike Lowell, the Red Sox were going to be starved for power this season&#8230;that is until Theo made the call to bring back a Red Sox legend.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I just realized that you can&#8217;t win ballgames unless you score runs, and we won&#8217;t score many runs without this move,&#8221; Epstein allegedly said.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Sox have &#8220;officially&#8221; (wink, wink) signed former first baseman Mo Vaughn to bring a much-needed jolt to the middle of the batting order.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/04/01/starving-for-power-sox-turn-to-mo-vaughn/">Starving for Power, Sox Turn to Mo Vaughn</a> (222 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the prodigal sons of the Pete Carroll era is returning to New England as free agent linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer has made a shock return to the Pats, agreeing to a two-year, incentive laden contract.</p>
<p>Katzenmoyer, who apparently isn&#8217;t the same person as ESPN analyst Andy Katz, was drafted by the Patriots with the 28th overall pick in the 1999 NFL draft and played two seasons with the Patriots. He suffered a neck injury in his rookie season and missed the next year due to personal issues. With the Pats seemingly looking to set a record for most linebackers on a roster, Katzenmoyer, 31, says while he hasn&#8217;t played football in a few years is still in playing shape at 6&#8217;3&#8243;, 245 pounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just ready to go, man,&#8221; Katzenmoyer told the Providence Journal by telephone. &#8220;I just hope my boys Michael Bishop and Tebucky Jones are still kickin&#8217; around so I&#8217;ll have someone to party with.&#8221;(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/04/01/andy-katzenmoyer-signs-with-patriots/">Andy Katzenmoyer Signs with Patriots</a> (99 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the Celtics facing a myriad of injuries, coach Doc Rivers has decided to make a shocking return to the NBA, 13 years after he retired from playing basketball in 1996. Danny Ainge signed Doc to a 10-day contract Wednesday morning to give the team an extra player in case of injury.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Looking through the free agent pool, I saw that no one would know our complex system in a short amount of time. No one knows our system better than Doc, so I figured the decision was easy. I feel that Doc brings a veteran presence on the court that no one available could provide,&#8221; said Danny Ainge (paraphrased).</p></blockquote>
<p>Doc Rivers, 47, played for four teams during his 13-year NBA career. He has coached the Celtics since the 2004-05 season, but has never played a game for the NBA&#8217;s most storied franchise.</p>
<p><strong>Reaction</strong>: I know the Celtics are desperate for warm bodies, but this seems a little ridiculous.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/04/01/doc-rivers-to-suit-up-against-bobcats/">Doc Rivers to Suit Up Against Bobcats</a> (58 words)</p>
