				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Major League Baseball Player&#8217;s Union released a statement regarding the now-infamous list of 104 names tied to performance-enhancing drugs in 2003 (later on, the <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/08/08/major-league-baseball-statement-on-2003-steroids-list/">MLB Commissioner&#8217;s Office released their own statement</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The New York Times recently reported that David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez &#8220;are among the roughly 100 Major League Baseball players to test positive for performance-enhancing drugs in 2003.&#8221; The reported sources for this statement were &#8220;lawyers with knowledge of the [test] results&#8221; who &#8220;spoke anonymously because the testing information is under seal by a court order.&#8221; The Association has previously offered its views regarding this patent violation of court orders by attorneys, and The New York Times&#8217; active pursuit and publication of what it openly acknowledges to be information that may not be legally disclosed.</p>
<p>“In light of the Times&#8217; report, and all the other newspaper reports it has spurred, the Association feels compelled to offer the following additional comments:</p>
<p>“The sealing orders, which were appropriately issued by the various courts to maintain the collectively-bargained confidentiality of the testing, prevent the Association from supplying a player with specifics regarding his 2003 test results, or from discussing those specifics publicly. The practical effect of the sealing orders, if that confidentiality is to be maintained, is to further preclude the Players Association from confirming or denying whether a player&#8217;s name appears on any list which purportedly discloses the 2003 test results. The result is that any union member alleged to have tested positive in 2003 because his name supposedly appears on some list &#8212; most recently David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez – finds himself in an extremely unfair position; his reputation has been threatened by a violation of the court&#8217;s orders, but respect for those orders now leaves him without access to the information that might permit him to restore his good name.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/08/08/mlb-players-union-statement-on-2003-steroids-list/">MLB Player&#8217;s Union Statement on 2003 Steroids List</a> (282 words)</p>
