<blockquote><p> “He is no longer associated with the BU hockey team,” said coach Jack Parker, who added that Trivino&#8217;s departure means the team has &#8220;a big hole to fill.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Trivino allegedly forced his way into the room of a female student on 10 Buick Street and attempted to kiss and repeatedly grope her. He was arrested Sunday night and charged with three counts of indecent assault and battery, two counts of breaking and entering, and <strong>one count of assault with attempt to rape</strong>, <a href="http://www.bu.edu/today/2011/mens-hockey-star-arrested/" target="_blank">according to BU Today</a>.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2011/12/13/corey-trivino-arrested-for-groping-student-thrown-off-bu-hockey-team/">Corey Trivino Arrested For Groping Student, Thrown Off BU Hockey Team</a> (417 words)</p>

<h2>Eagles never trail, but can never bury Yale</h2>
<p>There was a sense that this might be a high scoring affair since Yale is the top scoring team in the nation and the Eagles are third. The feeling was probably confirmed when Carl Sneep of the Eagles dumped the puck out of the BC zone and it bounded past Ryan Rondeau at the other end for a shorthanded goal and a 2-1 Eagle lead. There were also two four-on-four goals, three power play goals, and an extra attacker goal in the game.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/03/29/bc-outduels-yale-to-advance-to-frozen-four/">BC Outduels Yale to Advance to Frozen Four</a> (304 words)</p>

<p>With RIT another four seed making the Frozen Four, history is being made again this season. Saint Cloud got its first tournament victory, RIT has its first two in the program&#8217;s first postseason appearance, and Alaska made their tournament debut, albeit a loss. Yale also recorded its first tournament victory since 1952.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/03/27/bc-moves-on-unh-shut-down/">BC Moves on, UNH Shut Down</a> (742 words)</p>

New Hampshire, playing in an evening contest, got off to a slow start, trailing 1-0 with three minutes to go in the second period to Cornell and their goalie, Ben Scrivens. Scrivens had not allowed a goal in three games and only one in their four ECAC playoff games as the Big Red won the league title.</p>
<p>However, UNH came to life at the end of the second with a goal from Hobey finalist Bobby Butler that went through the side of the net. Mike Sislo scored 26 seconds later to change the complexion of the game entirely, giving UNH an edge they would never cede. Cornell went from a team content to nurse a 1-0 lead and let Scrivens carry them to a scurrying team that just could not organize itself, especially on offense. This was best evidenced in Butler&#8217;s second goal, in the third period, which put UNH up 4-1 and really iced the game. Cornell attempted to take the puck out of the zone, but just lost it and Butler emerged with the puck, going the other way, and beat Scrivens one-on-one.</p>
<p>Just to show that it was not Cornell&#8217;s day, Butler was on the ice to go for the hat trick while Cornell pulled the goalie for the extra attacker. Paul Thompson got the puck on the left side with what looked like a sure goal, but dished it over to Butler, on the right side in traffic. Instead, Cornell broke up the pass, but in doing so, directed the puck right into the net, crediting the goal to Thompson. Butler, Thompson, and Sislo each recorded two goals. Brian Foster recorded 24 saves in the win.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/03/27/unh-rips-cornell-vermont-penalties-spell-doom/">UNH Rips Cornell; Vermont Penalties Spell Doom</a> (370 words)</p>

<p>Maine scored two power play goals in eight chances, with their 25% efficiency actually being down from their near 30% mark coming into the game. BC took advantage with two of their own in only five tries. Maine scored with the extra attacker on the ice off of a face off in the BC zone with 27.6 seconds to go to tie the game and force the overtime. Matt Lombardi won the game with his third goal of the game (and only sixth of the season) 5:25 into the extra period.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/03/20/bc-wins-ninth-hockey-east-title-over-maine/">BC Wins Ninth Hockey East Title Over Maine</a> (179 words)</p>

<p>BU cannot make the NCAAs with the loss and Maine will need to beat BC in the final to do so. Vermont is squarely on the bubble and will have to sweat it out Sunday. An upset autobid from another conference, or even a Maine win, likely spells doom for the Catamounts. Regular season champion UNH will also have to sweat it out for a spot in the 16 team tournament. They are ahead of Vermont in the pecking order, but have not locked up a spot yet.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/03/19/eagles-and-black-bears-to-meet-for-hockey-east-title/">Eagles and Black Bears to Meet for Hockey East Title</a> (235 words)</p>
