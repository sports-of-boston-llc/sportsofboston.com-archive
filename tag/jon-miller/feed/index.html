<p>Finally, ESPN has listened to the masses! They have decided to let Morgan&#8217;s contract expire, and have offered the departing Miller a chance to call their Sunday night games on the radio. Miller, the Giants play-by-play man, has a decision to make. Morgan, meanwhile, is out of work.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/11/09/joe-morgan-fired-espn-lets-morgan-miller-go-from-sunday-night-baseball/">Joe Morgan Fired!

Wait a minute, I realize. This really sucks.</p>
<p>And the thing is, it sucks on so many different levels: A wide, glaring spectrum of suckage. For one thing, and I cannot stress this enough, the Home Run Derby is not even a baseball game, yet you still have to suffer through Joe Morgan speaking out loud. I can understand gutting it out for a Sunday night game, because the excellent Jon Miller is there to water down his awfulness. Nor do I wish to give the impression that I think Mr. Morgan is a bad human being: He is, after all, a second baseman, the position I played with somewhat less distinction, and we middle infielders stick together. It&#8217;s just that, as a color commentator, his witlessness and inanity are bywords.</p>
<p>Speaking of witlessness and inanity, guess who else growls and grunts in your ear throughout the Home Run Derby? That&#8217;s right, <em>the Swami</em> &#8212; why he has this title, I cannot care enough to actually look up &#8212; himself, Chris Berman, whose semi-retirement has clearly been treating his digestion better than his brain.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our good friend, Shotgun, over at the Blue Workhorse Blog recently put up an article where he addressed <a href="http://blueworkhorse.com/nba/30-observations-from-celticshawks-series/">33 points about the Hawks and Celtics round one playoff match up</a>. There were several of these points that I agree with and I think most others who watched the series would also agree with. However, there are a few other points I would look in the opposite direction that Shotgun has.</p>
<p>1. Point 7 had to due Mike Bibby&#8217;s comments about the Boston fans being bandwagon jumpers this season. It&#8217;s true that there were probably more fans this season than last, but it&#8217;s hard to watch a team that only wins 24 games in a season. It&#8217;s very frustrating for the die hard fans, like myself, to torture themselves by watching their team lose game after game after game. So the Celtics start winning again and the fans come back. These fans may have jumped on some sort of bandwagon at the beginning of the season but at least they have been there all year long. The Hawks seemed to just draw fans when they clinched the last seed in the playoffs.</p>
