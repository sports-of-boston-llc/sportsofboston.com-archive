(AP Photo/Elise Amendola)" ></a><p>The Boston Red Sox continued their four-game series against the Cleveland Indians Wednesday night at Fenway Park. Making his long-awaited return from the disabled list was <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=28637">Jacoby Ellsbury</a>, playing in just his tenth game of the season. On the hill for the Red Sox was <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=28487">Jon Lester</a>, who had lost all three of his starts since the All-Star Break. The Indians countered with former Red Sox member <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=28977">Justin Masterson</a>, whose most recent start had been his worst of the season, giving up eight earned runs while just pitching into the sixth inning. However, the Red Sox were not thinking about his most recent loss. They were more concerned with his June 9 complete game shutout against Boston, a game in which the Red Sox were in it until the 8th inning, when the Indians <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/06/10/masterson-masterful-sox-bullpen-battered-in-defeat/">scored 8 runs</a> against the weaker elements of Boston&#8217;s bullpen. The Indians won that game 11-0. Wednesday&#8217;s game did not go much better.</p>
<p>Lester started out strongly, retiring the first six batters he faced. However, in the third inning he found himself with runners on first and second with nobody out. <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=29241">Lou Marson</a> dropped down a sacrifice bunt, but Lester fielded it quickly and saw that he had time to go to third and nail the lead runner. Unfortunately, his throw went over <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=3878">Adrian Beltre&#8217;s</a> head, and <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=5916">Andy Marte</a> came around to score. Lester settled down and finished the inning without giving up another run, but he found himself in a similar situation in the fifth inning. With men on first and third with nobody out, Lester first gave up a sacrifice fly to <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=28671">Asdrubal Cabrera</a>, then watched as catcher <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=5326">Kevin Cash</a> missed a pitch outside that rolled to the backstop. It was ruled a passed ball, but it allowed <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=29671">Jason Donald</a> (2-5, two runs scored) to go to second. He would later advance to third on a ground out and then score on an RBI double by <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=28832">Shelley Duncan</a>. At this point Lester appeared to cramp up in his left leg, however he was able to stretch it out and stay in the game.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/08/05/errors-prove-costly-as-indians-clobber-red-sox/">Errors Prove Costly as Indians Clobber Red Sox</a> (1,159 words)</p>
