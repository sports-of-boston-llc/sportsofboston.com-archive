The Sox acquired left handed reliever Fernando Abad from the Minnesota Twins in exchange for minor league lefty Pat Light.</p>
<p>Abad will help the Sox&#8217;s struggling bullpen as left handed hitters have only a .163 batting average off him this season. This is not a big trade but will definitely aid the Sox a little with their pitching situation. But the move that everyone was hoping for was to see another stud pitcher in the starting rotation.</p>
<p>Everyone knows Chris Sale was the talk of the deadline but it was no surprise to me that he stayed with Chicago. A dominant pitcher like him is not going to go anywhere without a very large trade being put in place. It&#8217;s a shame the Sox couldn&#8217;t snag him because he is just what we are missing.</p>
<p>However, I have to say I am very surprised Andrew Benintendi and Joan Moncada stayed with the AA Portland Sea Dogs. I expected the Sox to move at least one of them in a trade to acquire a starting pitcher. Now that they are staying in the Sox farm system, I don&#8217;t know what the Sox are going to do with their starting rotation.</p>
<p>The addition of Drew Pomeranz was viewed as a good move at first but is looking a little shaky right now. Steven Wright has had a couple bad starts lately and David Price is still yet to get into a consistent groove. The only consistent pitcher the Sox have right now is Rick Porcello who quietly has been a stud this year with a 14-2 record.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what the Sox are going to do but if they want to be serious contenders for the playoffs, their pitching has to make some adjustments. The AL East and the American League in general is very competitive right now and it&#8217;s really a toss up for which teams are going to win the division and the wild card.</p>
<p>Safe to say this trade deadline helped, but it wasn&#8217;t enough.</p>

<p>If Pomeranz is going to succeed in Boston, he&#8217;s going to have to develop another pitch.  The one thing I noticed last night is mostly all of Pomeranz pitches come into right handed batters, which with the wall in left field is a recipe for disaster.  A changeup could be Pomeranz best friend if he learns how to throw one, a pitcher with his skills should be able to develop one.  The one thing that Red Sox fans should be concerned about is the last batter Pomeranz faced last night.  It was a bunt play, and Pomeranz didn&#8217;t get off the mound too quick, honestly it looked like he was just trying to get off the field at that point.</p>
<p>All and all I think Pomeranz will be fine in Boston, if he&#8217;s not he will see how brutal Boston can be if you can&#8217;t perform.</p>

<p>June is firmly in the rearview mirror for the suddenly wicked hot Boston Red Sox, and for at least 24 hours, doubts and criticisms have been silenced.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, the Red Sox needed only a one-run home run from Brock Holt to take the victory, but they graciously accepted a three run shot from Big Papi to provide all the run support that Rick Porcello would need. Porcello looked strong, earned his tenth straight win at home, and the Sox shut out the team with the best record in the majors. It was a feel good win, reminiscent of Octobers past, and indicative of Octobers future.</p>

Coming out of the break, Sox fans (including myself) were hopeful that David Price had figured out the source of his struggles throughout the first half of the year. Unfortunately, it was much of the same for Price and the Sox last night in the Bronx.</p>
<p>Like so many times this season, the big lefty looked sharp in the opening frames. His velocity was excellent, painting the black with a fastball touching 96 mph early and often. That, combined with his ability to mix in his breaking ball saw Price making quick work of the Yankees 19th ranked lineup through the first three innings. But, much like it has SO many times this season, one big inning ultimately did in the Red Sox &#8220;ace&#8221;.</p>
<p>So often this year, Price&#8217;s nemesis has been the long ball. While he didn&#8217;t allow a yabo last night, (a small miracle) he did surrender five hits in the fourth inning that resulted in three Yankee runs. Combine that with an excellent performance from Tanaka and the great Yankee bullpen, and that was all she wrote for the Sox and their six game winning streak.</p>
<p>Watching a pitcher with Price&#8217;s track record and ability struggle so mightily this season has been nothing short of perplexing. Mowing down lineups for years with the Rays, Jays, and Tigers, no one could have envisioned him sitting on an ERA of 4.36 twenty starts into his Red Sox career. Here&#8217;s hoping he can right the ship before the Sox and their playoff hopes disappear in the heat of the summer.</p>

<p>This game held special meaning for David Ortiz, the AL DH. In his final season, and final all star game, Ortiz was the starter for the AL at DH. While Ortiz was certainly the man of the hour, it was his Red Sox counterparts that actually outperformed Papi in San Diego.</p>
<p>Ortiz went 0 for 1, with a walk, and was pulled shortly thereafter. Xander Bogaerts, Mookie Betts, and JBJ all had at least one hit, contributing to the 4-2 victory over the NL.</p>
<p>Xander smacked a double down the left field line, Betts singled and scored, and Jackie Bradley sent two singles through the infield.</p>
<p>Eric Hosmer was the game&#8217;s MVP, who homered and drove in two runs.</p>
<p>The Red Sox are back in action tonight, taking on the Yankees in the Bronx. Eduardo Rodriguez is starting for the Red Sox.</p>
<p>The Red Sox are doing well so far in July. It has been no secret that pitching has been holding this team back. As previously spoken about on SOB, Dave Dombrowski traded Anderson Espinoza, the number one pitching prospect for the Red Sox to San Diego for Drew Pomeranz, who is likely to be the number two or three starter for Boston moving forward.</p>
<p>The Red Sox also managed to sign their first round draft pick, Jason Groome, to a $3.65 million contract, pending a physical.</p>

<h3>Seth Smith, San Diego Padres:</h3>
<p>With only five home runs on the season, Smith might not be that tantalizing of an option. However, with the Padres playing a lot of right-handed pitchers, the veteran outfielder is a great streamer option as he has hit homers in consecutive contests against righties and should get more playing time as he has brought life to a listless offense.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2014/05/20/week-8-waiver-wire-pickups-seth-smith-yangervis-solarte-showing-pop/">Week 8 Waiver-Wire Pickups: Seth Smith, Yangervis Solarte Showing Pop</a> (347 words)</p>
