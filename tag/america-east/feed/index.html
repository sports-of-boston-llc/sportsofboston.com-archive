				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever since their last minute collapse against the University of Vermont, where the Catamounts rallied from a 75-71 deficit in the final 60 seconds of play to stun BU, the Terriers have turned their game around and are winners of three straight contests. If you set aside the last minute of the Vermont game, where the Terriers blew a four point lead, BU has been playing exceptional basketball as of late. Winners of five of their past six games, Coach PatChambers has his squad firing on all cylinders as the team prepares for its final regular season game against Maine, where nine seniors will be honored in pre-game festivities.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/02/23/terriers-catching-fire-down-the-stretch/">Terriers Catching Fire Down the Stretch</a> (630 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For three consecutive years, the Terriers have been preseason selections by America East coaches and by several sports related websites, such as ESPN and CBS Sports, to advance to the NCAA tournament, but BU has failed to do so since 2002. This year, whichÂ started out so promising, seems to have the same trend as previous Terrier basketball teams over the past five years. The Terriers currently find themselves in fourth place in the America East standings at 8-5, but the team has been unable to string together victories or defeat any of the teams above them in the conference.</p>
<p>Since their previous two game losing streak, BU easily defeated UNH (69-47) and Albany (68-53), before a heartbreaking 76-75 loss against Vermont. Boston University has three home conference games left against America East competition, along with a bracket buster matchup at Delaware, where the Terriers look for their third consecutive win in the collegiate wide invitational.Â This is a key stretch of four games that will lead up to the America East Conference Tournament, March 5-7, in West Hartford, CT.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/02/14/the-missing-link-with-terrier-basketball/">The Missing Link with Terrier Basketball</a> (700 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Boston University basketball team has found themselves in a downward spiral headed into the last month of conference play. Coach Pat Chambers and his squad have fallen to fifth overall in the America East conference and have dropped two straight games against the upper echelon teams of theÂ league. BU has suffered recent losses to conference foes Stony Brook, Maine, and Vermont, currently ranked first through third in the conference.</p>
<p>Four of the six Terrier wins have come against the bottom feeders of the conference UMBC, UNH, and Albany, who have only combined for five conference victories. BU has struggled against the better teams in the conference, getting blown out by 20 at Vermont last Sunday, January 17th, and recently getting defeated by 16 against Stony Brook. For the third consecutive year, BU has been picked as the preseason conference favorite to win the America East, but this statement is looking bleaker by the day. Coach Chambers has some serious work to do before their next game at Agganis Arena, this Thursday vs. New Hampshire.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/02/03/terriers-in-a-funk-losers-of-two-straight-games/">Terriers in a Funk, Losers of Two Straight Games</a> (336 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Trio of Terriers Leads BU to Third Straight Victory</strong></p>
<p>Coming off a stellar offensive game against the University of Hartford, where Corey Lowe and John Holland eclipsed the 30 point mark in the same game for the first time in school history, three BU players scored at least 20 points to lead the Terriers past a struggling UMBC team, 75-63. John Holland led the trio with 25, while Lowe and Jake O&#8217;Brien contributed 20 points apiece to pace BU. Last year, UMBC erased BU&#8217;s hopes for winning the conference tourney, upsetting BU in overtime. However, this year UMBC has struggled to win games, mostly due to having a young and inexperienced team. BU has been marred by a slow starts throughout the season, and this game began no differently.</p>
<p>BU fell behind quickly by seven points and were forced to fight back. BU fueled their comeback from beyond the arc and quickly erased the lead ten minutes into the game; they never looked back once they jumped on top, and only let UMBC cut the lead to six in the second half. Chris De La Rosa and Chauncey Gilliam led the Retrievers with 13 points each, as they saw their record fall to 1-14 (0-4).(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/01/19/terriers-finish-the-second-week-of-conference-play-behind-vermont/">Terriers Finish the Second Week of Conference Play Behind Vermont</a> (552 words)</p>
