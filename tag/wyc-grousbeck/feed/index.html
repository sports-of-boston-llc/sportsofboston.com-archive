It&#8217;s all happening! Everything is awesome! It&#8217;s not a stretch to say that yesterday was the biggest day in the Groesbeck/Ainge/Stevens era in Boston. Danny was finally able to close that elusive big-name free agent, and Wyc was able to make good on his promise of &#8220;fireworks&#8221; that the fan base has been waiting on for what feels like centuries. Sure, $113 million over four years seems like a pretty penny, but with the money being thrown around this offseason and the huge cap increase on the horizon next season, Horford&#8217;s deal is actually somewhat of a bargain.</p>
<p>Horford&#8217;s game will fit seamlessly within the Brad Stevens system. He provides a much needed presence at the rim, and gives the C&#8217;s the go-to fourth quarter scoring option that they were sorely missing in last year&#8217;s playoffs. I cannot WAIT to see Isaiah and Horford running the pick and pop down the throats of the entire Eastern Conference come October.</p>
<p>By no means is Al Horford a perfect player, as evidence by his lackluster performance in the playoffs last season against these Celtics. He struggles defensively at times, particularly on the perimeter defending the pick and roll. The C&#8217;s team approach to defense should help to conceal some of Horford&#8217;s defensive deficiencies over the course of the season.</p>
<p>Hot damn, the Celtics are officially back. They finally landed a big name free-agent for the first time in the history of the franchise, (Go ahead look it up, I&#8217;ll wait) and they got a guy who WANTS to play in Boston. KD or not, this signing was a huge step in the right direction for this franchise. If TB12, Big Papi, and Julian Edleman have anything to do with it, Kevin Durant will be donning Celtic green next season in the city of champions. What a time to be a Celtics fan. What a time to be alive.</p>

<p>Then the first 2 picks went off the board and the moment was finally here.  Celtics fans everywhere were expecting Adam Silver to go to the podium and announce a trade.  Then as he stepped up to the podium he said &#8220;And with the number 3 pick The Boston Celtics select Jaylen Brown From The University Of California&#8221;.  Just like that Celtic fans everywhere were deflated (sorry I know that&#8217;s a touchy word around New England).  All this hope has been shot down, and from the reaction of Celtic fans they were not happy.  It was good to see Boston fans boo, Celtic fans don&#8217;t do that often and it really seemed like Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck looked uncomfortable when he was booed off the stage.  Which by the way I don&#8217;t think has ever happened before.</p>
<p>Personally, I like Jaylen Brown as a player.  He&#8217;s versatile, athletic, and can defend other team&#8217;s best player.  The problem is The Celtics have multiple guys on the roster with these same skills.  Brown has to improve his shooting, last season he only shot .294% from the three point line.  Jaylen Brown could be an impact player for The Celtics, and it could be this season.  We won&#8217;t know if this was the right pick until two to three years from now.  After the Celtics didn&#8217;t make a splash with pick number 3, I felt they were going to draft and stash.  The Celtic&#8217;s didn&#8217;t want to be tied up with guaranteed contracts and not be able to do something in free agency, and the only way to draft guys and not have to pay them was to stash them overseas.</p>
<p>The Celtics and more importantly Wyc Grousbeck have really created this monster.  This monster being us Celtics fans that want to win now and are tired of always waiting for next year&#8217;s draft.  We all know Danny is really trying to bring a superstar into Boston, but until that happens don&#8217;t promise us fireworks and then leave us with an unlit firecracker.</p>

This move did not set the benchmark for small market teams, as one would think, for two primary reasons: Kevin Durant was part of the deal and now Seattle has become leverage for the NBA in future negotiating deals.</p>
<p>See, the NBA, under David Stern, became infatuated with the notion that each team should have a new, state-of-the-art arena, equipped with cutting-edge restaurants, absurdly accommodating and expensive luxury boxes and multi-functional layouts, all at the cost of taxpayers and owners, for the sake of upping league revenue. When owners of small market teams could not meet Stern&#8217;s demands for new stadiums, he would use the threat of relocation of their team to Seattle as a bargaining chip.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2014/10/28/celtics-owner-wyc-grousbeck-received-two-serious-offers-to-purchase-team/">Celtics Owner Wyc Grousbeck Received Two &#8220;Serious&#8221; Offers to Purchase Team</a> (394 words)</p>

<p align="left">The Celtics franchise changed dramatically with Paul Gaston&#8217;s sale of the team in late 2002. In came Boston Basketball Partners LLC, and owners Wyc Grousbeck, H. Irving Grousbeck, Steve Pagliuca, Robert Epstein, David Epstein, and John Svenson. On Sept. 27 of that year, the Celtics announced the team was sold pending league approval. On New Year&#8217;s Eve, 2002, the sale was officially announced. Wyc Grousbeck, the Managing Partner and CEO of the company, was extremely excited about the $360 million purchase: &#8220;This is the thrill of a lifetime. Our local ownership group, the first local owners in decades, is honored to accept this role and begin working with the team and the community to continue the winning tradition of the Celtics on and off the court.&#8221;</p>
