By that I mean, I decide who would win positional battles. Like actual positional battles. Like if two players of the same position literally fought each other, who would win? Gonzalez wins over Teixeira easily. Sabathia overpowers Beckett with his 5,000 pounds of saturated fat. Pedroia cat fights his way over Cano. What do all these players have in common? These guys are all the cores of their teams. Comparing role players and the bench just seems irrelevant (and really lame). But two players stand as anomalies to this disgusting generalization &#8212; <a href="espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/3760/jason-varitek" target="_blank">Jason Varitek</a> and <a href="espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/3341/jorge-posada" target="_blank">Jorge Posada</a>.</p>
<p>Five or six years ago, this would have been right up there as one of those highlighted positional battles. These two were the hearts of their respective teams. Today&#8211;well they’re both still playing for the same teams. However, with age and diminished skill sets, both Varitek and Posada have similarly seen their roles change. How these two handled the transitions could not have been anymore different.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2011/09/02/who-would-win-in-a-fight-jason-varitek-or-jorge-posada/">Who Would Win in a Fight: Jason Varitek or Jorge Posada?</a> (574 words)</p>

<p>Jeter, Pettitte, Posada, and Rivera have been the core of the Yankees for the past fifteen season and each had a role in the teams&#8217; last five World Championship.

JERRY!! JERRY!! They Yankees and Blue Jays <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090915&amp;content_id=6987710&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb" target="_new">threw down</a> twice in the 8th inning of Tuesday’s game in New York of a 10-4 Blue Jays win. Things started in the 6th when Jays’ batter Edwin Encarnacion was hit in the shoulder and earlier in the 8th when another Jays’ batter Aaron Hill was hit in the back. Obviously, this last one in particular was viewed as intentional, since in the bottom of the inning, Jesse Carlson threw a ball way behind Jorge Posada, leading to an intense stare-down and peaceful bench clearing incident.</p>
<p>Posada ended up walking, and would later score on a double. As he ran past Carlson, who was covering the plate, he elbowed Carlson in the chest, which drew some shouts which immediately sparked the second, yet violent bench-clearing brawl. Both players were obviously ejected, though the fun didn’t end there. We couldn’t see what was going on in the thick pile, though Carlson came out bleeding from a welt on his forehead. Catcher Rod Barajas was dragged along the ground by his chest protector at one point, and Yankees manager Joe Girardi took a shot to his left eye and ear, cutting his ear in the process.</p>
<p>Remarkably, cuts and scrapes were the worst of things on either side. The Blue Jays finished their defeat of the Yankees, which coupled with a Red Sox victory puts the Red Sox 6.5 games behind the Yankees in the AL East. If we keep playing like this and the Yankees keep playing like that (and fighting their players away), we might win the division after all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;d prefer to title this &#8220;How the Yankees have had bad timing against Boston.&#8221; Yes, it&#8217;s well documented that the Yankees have lost all eight meetings so far against the Red Sox. But, I think we need a further examination as to why the Red Sox have won all eight games to see if we can expect this dominance to continue.</p>
<p>The first meeting was at Fenway and the Yankees lost 5-4. Both teams had a lot of baserunners as the Yankees had 21 and the Red Sox had 19. The Yankees had a two-run lead in the bottom of the 9th when Mariano Rivera blew the save. Mariano&#8217;s fastball was 1-2 mph slower in this game and his control was off as well. Also of note is that Alex Rodriguez was not playing this game as he was still rehabbing his hip.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/06/22/why-the-red-sox-have-beaten-the-yankees/">Why the Red Sox Have Beaten the Yankees</a> (685 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sox Fans normally don&#8217;t want to see players get injured, even Yankees, but this has to be good news for the home town team. The Yankees placed <strong>Jorge Posada</strong> on the 15-day disabled list with an injured shoulder. Posada, who signed a $52.4 million, four-year deal in the offseason, is not sure whether to go with surgery, which would would surely end his season.</p>
<p>But, if he attempts to play with pain again, it could cost him part of next season as well.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the biggest thing. I don&#8217;t want to miss two years. I&#8217;m already flustered with this one because I haven&#8217;t been 100 percent and I&#8217;ve been trying to play through a lot of pain.&#8221; &#8211; Jorge Posada</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/2007/11/12/2007-11-12_jorge_posada_to_stay_with_yankees.html">NYDailyNews.com</a> Jorge Posada has resigned with the Yankees. More from the source:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jorge Posada, the 36-year-old free agent catcher, will remain a Yankee, sources familiar with the negotiations told the Daily News Monday night.</p>
<p>After being schmoozed by Mets general manager Omar Minaya Monday afternoon during a lengthy lunch at Le Cirque, Posada and his agents finally received the offer from the Yankees they had been hoping for all along.</p>
<p>The Yankees offered Posada a four-year, $52 million contract &#8211; the same deal they gave both Johnny Damon and Hideki Matsui two years ago &#8211; to remain in pinstripes. The deal will become official pending a physicial and final contract language being ironed out.</p>
<p>In a lunch meeting with Brian Cashman on Friday, Posada and his wife, Laura, made it clear to the Yankees&#8217; GM  that they were seeking a four-year contract.</p>
<p>Cashman had been holding firm to the team&#8217;s original three-year, $40 million offer throughout the negotiations, but after mulling over the issue this weekend, Cashman, Hank and Hal Steinbrenner agreed during a morning conference call yesterday that they would give Posada the fourth year.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what Posada is like at 39 and 40 years old. I&#8217;d say he is a year away from playing first. It wouldn&#8217;t hurt the Yankees to move him there now, if they had a replacement. Posada could have asked for more because he was the only option. 60 mil for 4 years would have been in the ballpark.</p>
