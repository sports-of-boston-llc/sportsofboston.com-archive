How about we focus on the positives? Who deserves a PAT on the back for their performance against the Colts?

Coach Bill Belichick, the infallible one himself, figuratively fumbled the game away, opting to <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/tag/4th-and-2/">go for the first down on 4th-and-2</a>, at their own 28 yard line.  And just like that, a great effort from the majority of the Patriots roster was canceled out by the arrogant call of the head coach.</p>
<p>Minutes later, Peyton Manning marched his Colts the short distance he had left to go, before tossing a touchdown pass to Reggie Wayne for the game-winner.  The <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/11/16/patriots-give-colts-early-christmas-present/">Colts won 35-34</a>, in a Pats game that hasn’t stung that bad since the other Manning’s team ended the Pats’ undefeated season in improbable fashion.  At least in that game, I felt Eli and the Giants deserved the win.  Sunday night&#8217;s Colts win came too cheap, in my opinion.  The win was handed to them on a silver platter, there for the taking.  Darn those Mannings…darn them all to heck!</p>
<p>But, negativity is not what I’m here for.  “PATS on the Back” is here each and every week to accentuate the positive, even after the grimmest of games.  So put on your rose-colored glasses, sip the Pats’ Kool-Aid, and read on, as I highlight three Patriots who despite the outcome, still deserve some praise.</p>
<h2>Randy Moss, WR</h2>
<p>In a game that featured future Hall of Famers from both teams, on the field and on the sidelines, Randy Moss was arguably the best player on the field Sunday night.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/11/18/pats-on-the-back-patriots-vs-colts-week-10/">PATS on the Back: Patriots vs. Colts, Week 10</a> (405 words)</p>

<p><em><strong>This is in response to John, <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/11/17/4th-and-too-much-to-risk/">who thinks that going for it on 4th and 2 is too risky</a>, and in accordance with George, who <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/11/17/why-we-should-be-praising-bill-belichick/">praised Bill Belichick for the move</a>.</strong></em></p>
<p>The math has been done on Belichick&#8217;s already-infamous decision to go for it on 4th down on Sunday night. But, there are still plenty of doubters out there, clinging to conventional wisdom and factors they claim are un- or under-accounted for. As a stats-oriented fan, my initial inclination is always to demand proof &#8211; to call out methodology and make a stand for logical consistency.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not a very convincing or compelling case, and it&#8217;s a bigger argument than we need to be having here. What I&#8217;m really calling out is a sports world-view. I think that, in all walks of life, but especially in sports, discussion needs bedrock. It needs a common set of agreed-upon truths. Those are/should be the truths of mathematical and statistical analysis. Most people would rather analyze with their gut, or with their experience, or with their long history of watching sports (note that those are all the same thing), because it&#8217;s easier and more accessible.<br />

But, let’s consider a few things first before deciding what to do.</p>
<h2>Field Position</h2>
<p>First, we have the position, with the Pats on their own 28. Belichick obviously believes in his offense, which is why many people said he went for it (like he has been known to do before). The rumor mill has also accused Coach Belichick of not having faith in his defense to stop Peyton Manning and the Colts from marching downfield in two minutes for a touchdown. Say the Pats go for it and make it. Great; game over. But what if they miss? We saw the obvious answer play out Sunday.</p>
<p>Peyton and Indianapolis breathed new life when faced with certain defeat. They easily marched the short 29 yards for the score. And why wouldn’t they? The Colts had a huge morale boost from this turn of events, at the expense of Patriots&#8217; morale from blowing the play.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/11/17/4th-and-too-much-to-risk/">4th and Too Much to Risk</a> (577 words)</p>

</em></strong></p>
<p>When the Patriots’ offense took the field on fourth down in the fourth quarter, my initial reaction was one of shock and confusion. However, as time has passed and emotions have calmed down, I cannot help but think that this was the absolutely right call to make. Not only was it the right call to make, but it’s a call that no other NFL coach makes. This is why instead of criticizing the decision to go for it on fourth and two, we should be praising Bill Belichick for making the right call because the easy way out is to just punt the ball and hope your defense can stop one of the best quarterbacks to ever live. Let’s be honest, there’s a 50 percent chance that the play resulted in a first down and the referee just missed the call. We will never know.</p>
<h2>A Closer Look at the Numbers</h2>
<p>If you look at the numbers, the better chance to win was to go for it. The NFL conversion rate on fourth and two is 60 percent. Add Tom Brady, Kevin Faulk, Randy Moss and Wes Welker to that equation, and the chance that offense gains two yards jumps to at least 75%. Obviously, I am just throwing out numbers, but the point is that the chances are very good that one of the best offenses in the NFL will gain two yards on a given play. <a href="http://www.advancednflstats.com/2009/11/belichicks-4th-down-decision-vs-colts.html">This site</a> explains it better than I can. Belichick made a decision to put the ball in his best player’s hands to win the game and the Colts defense made a great play to give their offense a chance to win the game.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/11/17/why-we-should-be-praising-bill-belichick/">Why We Should Be Praising Bill Belichick</a> (502 words)</p>
