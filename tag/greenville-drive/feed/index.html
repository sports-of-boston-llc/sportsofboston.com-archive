After a senior season in which he was named a 2014 Perfect Game First-Team All-American thanks to a heater that sits aroud 93-96 mph and touches 98, his talent was rewarded with a juicy $1.67 million signing bonus that enticed him out of his commitment to the University of Arizona. As a pitcher he is unpolished but projects as a top of the rotation starter if his development goes according to plan.</p>
<p>Only 19 years old, Kopech is an imposing presence at 6-foot 3-inches tall and 205 pounds. On the mound he works from the left side of the rubber and initiates his deliver from the windup by shifting his body to his left with of his let good and a drop of hands from nose level to his wait. He rocks in to a high leg kick during which his hands move with leg, and then finishes the delivery by falling off the mound in the direction of first base. From this stretch his deliver mimics the same leg kick and hand movement he has from the wind-up.</p>
<p>During his first exposure to professional baseball in 2014 he threw only 13 2/3 innings for the GCL Red Sox, and had a tough 4.77 ERA but did strike out 16 batters. Then last year <span style="line-height: 1.5">he spent the entire season with the Greenville Drive</span><span style="line-height: 1.5">. He</span><span style="line-height: 1.5"> complemented his hard fastball with a developing slider and change-up, and earned himself a 2015 South Atlantic League All-Star selection. O</span><span style="line-height: 1.5">ver 15 starts and a relief appearance he accumulated<span style="line-height: 1.5"> 65 innings pitched</span> and posted a 4-5 record with 70 strikeouts and 2.63 ERA. </span></p>
<p>From a strictly statistical point of view Kopech had an impressive campaign but that analysis overlooks an important consideration. In mid-July his career was thrown a curve ball of its own when he tested positive for Oxilofine, a amphetamine class stimulant in violation of the Minor League Drug Prevention and Treatment Program, and was served a 50-game suspension. Kopech accepted the suspension and apologized for the his controversy but insistently denied that he knowingly used the drug.</p>
<p>Any time a player is linked to performance enhancing drugs there are whispers that emerge which are hard to shake. Until he gives doubters something else to talk about, the allegations will dominate all conversations surrounding him. Given that Kopech is only 19 year sold and claims he had no clue of the substance&#8217;s presence in his system, I expect this story to be forgotten by the end of the year. If he has one good year all the speculation will go away. As a Red Sox fan I sincerely hope it was a honest mistake on his part, and as a baseball fan I expect him to uphold the integrity of the game. Simply put, he must avoid any further controversy surrounding performance enhancing drugs.</p>
<p>Kopech needs to silence the doubters with a big year. It is unclear where he will start the season, but he will likely play a good portion of the year in the Class A-Advanced Carolina League with the Salem Red Sox. If he performs well he may even get a call up to Portland by the fall. This progression is contingent upon the development of his secondary offerings and overall command as a pitcher.</p>
<p>There is no doubt he has the natural talent to become a top of the rotation start in the big leagues. He potential is through the roof. 2016 is an important season for Kopech. He needs to end the critical speculation surrounding last year and move on as a professional by making improvements to his repertoire.</p>

A highly touted infielder for his natural athleticism and raw power, Chavis has yet to live up to the high expectations.</p>
<p>He has a balanced stance from the right handed batters box with his hands steady at shoulder level, and starts his swing with a short, quite stride. He unleashes his hands through the zone with impressive bat speed and scouts regard his raw power potential.</p>
<p>Growing up Chavis played primarily shortstop but when he was draft it was unclear whether he would stick at the position long-term. Last season Red Sox management decided to move him to third-base on a permanent based on their projection of Chavis&#8217; player profile. Unfortunately this transition has not gone smoothly as hoped.</p>
<p>In 39 games at the end of 2014 in rookie league with the GCL Red Sox, he had a decent performance but was not overwhelming. He spent time at both shortstop and third-base in that campaign and posted a respectable .767 OPS with one home-run and 16 RBI.  His trouble was in the field as he made seven errors in 39 games. Then last year, with the class-A Greenville Drive, he seemed to regress further. In 68 games at the hot corner he made 19 errors resulting in a dismal .907 fielding percentage. Chavis needs to work on his technique at the new position and it must be addressed if he wants to progress as a professional, but it is a skill that he can explicitly focus on and improve if he puts in the hard work.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the 20 year old prospect is heralded for his ability to hit the long-ball. Last season with the Drive he hit 16 home-runs and posted an impressive .182 ISO. The concern however is his approach in the batter&#8217;s box; although he hit those home runs, he appended the power output with a lousy 67% contact rate and 6% walk rate. This led to a disquieting .223/.277/.405 slash line.</p>
<p>In his limited professional exposure there are no doubts about Chavis&#8217; power, but the lack of plate discipline and feel for the strike-zone leave more to be desired. This is an aspect of baseball that does not come naturally to many but often improves as players accrue more plate appearances. It clicks for some prospects and not for others so by no means a presumed outcome for Chavis. He really needs to address this facet of his offensive toolbox if he wants to keep up his prospect stock.</p>
<p>Chavis is remains a young prospect very early in his development and despite last year&#8217;s struggles has plenty of time to improve upon the flaws in his game. Raw power is a valued tool in the baseball industry and there is no doubt he has it. 2016 is an important year for him as a professional and he needs to establish himself as a contributor in the Greenville lineup.</p>
<p>He remains years away from a debut at Fenway Park and hasn&#8217;t earned spotlight recognition from Red Sox Nation, but prospect junkies will be sure to have an eye on him in the next few of years. If he addresses the holes in his game and develops as a player I will expect to see him at Hadlock Field by late 2017 or early 2018.</p>

Even when it is the Celtics. I&#8217;ve written a couple posts about them, but I lack the same passion that I have for baseball. So, in response to this epiphany, I have decided to start a new segment for spring training focused on Red Sox prospects. These are some guys that Red Sox Nation should keep their eyes on in this spring and in the coming years. Because of all the hype Yoan Moncada and Rafael Devers have gotten since his signing I will skip him and save you the redundancy by simply saying: they are <strong>really</strong> promising prospects. To lead off the series this week&#8217;s post will feature Venezuelan RHP Anderson Espinoza, who was recently rated the #39 on the 2016 MLB Top Prospect List.</p>
<p>The Red Sox signed the 16-year old Espinoza for $1.8 million in the summer of 2014. At the time he threw his fastball 90-92, with a decent slider and makings of a change-up. In this past season at 17 years of age, his first as a professional in the United States, he was sitting 94-96 on the gun and touching 98. Pretty good for the equivalent of a junior in high school.</p>
<p>Espinoza has a wiry build at 6 feet tall and 170 pounds and looks like natural athlete on the mound. From the windup he as a simple low leg rock with an ever so slight pause at the top before he break his hands. This simple, efficient motion helps him repeat his delivery well for someone his age. Up to this point in his life he has been able to rely heavily on his explosive fastball without much need for a secondary pitch, and had a thorough debut in Rookie and low Class-A ball last year to the tone of a 2.16 ERA in the 15 starts. The next step in his progression will be to put on some muscle, develop a feel for his change-up and, like every young pitcher, improve his command of all three pitches.</p>
<p>Red Sox fans should not expect Espinoza to debut at Fenway Park anytime soon. He needs to put on some mass and develop as pitcher not just a thrower. It is likely he needs time in Class-A ball for a year or so before coming to Portland, but even that may still keep him on pace to debut at Fenway before his first legal beer. Expect him to start the year in Greenville with a possible of promotion to Salem by the end of the season. Plans for Espinoza are long term because he is so young, but with a special talent like his the sky is the limit.</p>
