<p>Despite a 4-0 start, the Patriots season has been plagued by injuries, especially on offense. However, we were all anticipating the return of Rob Gronkowski and Danny Amendola to help this struggling offense, and all seemed to be headed in the right direction. Until the first quarter of Sunday night&#8217;s game, that is.</p>
<p>In the first quarter of the game, Wilfork was carted off the field with an apparent ankle injury. It was later reported in the Boston Globe that Wilfork had a torn Achilles&#8217; tendon in his right foot. Wilfork was seen walking off the field in a walking boot and according to league sources, Wilfork will most likely be placed on season-ending injured reserve. Coach Bill Belichick also confirmed, “It doesn&#8217;t look too good for Vince.”(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2013/09/30/vince-wilfork-out-for-season-with-torn-achilles/">Vince Wilfork Out for Season With Torn Achilles</a> (350 words)</p>

(http://www.fanattic.net)" ></a><p>Just over two years ago, the Patriots made a shocking trade with the Oakland Raiders that sent the five-time Pro Bowl defensive lineman Richard Seymour to the Raiders for a first round draft pick. In the past, we had seen a number of great players leave because they wanted to be paid more than the Patriots were willing to offer. But the difference with this trade is that Seymour was still under contract with New England and was still performing and leading the Patriot defense at an extremely high level. Although it is still to early to say who got the better end of the trade, as of now, it appears Oakland did.</p>
<h2>Seymour’s New England Career</h2>
<p>Richard Seymour came to New England in 2001 as the sixth overall pick. Many people questioned the use of a pick that high on a defensive tackle wondering how much of an impact Seymour would make. But, Seymour proved his naysayers wrong, starting 10 games his rookie year and recording 3.5 sacks during the regular season and another one in the Super Bowl victory over St. Louis. He only got better from there, following his rookie season with his first of five straight Pro Bowls as well as his first of five straight All-Pro selections. While this streak was broken after he missed half of the 2007 season due to injury, Seymour followed it up with one of his best seasons in ’08, recording 8 sacks and leading the Pats with 17 quarterback hits.</p>
<p>Richard Seymour’s best asset to the Patriots was his ability to play at an extremely high level in both the 4-3 and the 3-4 defenses. Upon his arrival, there was a lot of speculation on whether or not Albert Haynesworth could play in a 3-4 defense, which he seemed unable or unwilling to do in Washington. No matter what the scheme was, Richard Seymour commanded double teams, and still put consistent pressure on the quarterback.</p>
<h2>Seymour’s new start in Oakland</h2>
<p>On September 6th 2009, just eight days before the start of the regular season, Seymour was traded to Oakland for a 2011 first round pick. The trade shocked Seymour, as well as most Patriots fans, not just because he would be leaving the only team he’d ever played for, but because he was going from one of the best teams in the league to one of the worst. Though he initially refused to report to the Raiders, Seymour arrived on September 12th and two days later registered two sacks in the Raiders&#8217; season opener against San Diego. After another disappointing 5-11 season, the Raiders returned to .500 for the first time in seven years with an 8-8 season in 2010. Seymour’s 5.5 sacks last year earned him his first Pro Bowl since 2006. This year, the Raiders seem to have the potential of surpassing last year’s effort, and Seymour already has 2.5 sacks through three games.</p>
<h2>Seymour’s Impact on and off the Field</h2>
<p>Although he was initially unhappy about joining a losing team, Richard Seymour has since embraced his role on the team. Although he has played great on the field since coming to Oakland, he has made even more of an impact in the locker room. No one on the Raiders except the punter and kicker were on the team in 2002 when they lost the Super Bowl. Before Seymour, there was no player on Oakland that had played on a Super Bowl-winning team, let alone played a major role in that team’s victory. So <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12vY33lbq1M#t=2m35s" target="_blank">when Seymour said</a>, while wearing his three Super Bowl rings, &#8220;I&#8217;ve won these rings, but the group that I’m standing in front of today is more talented than any of those groups that I won these rings with,&#8221; you know his teammates listened.</p>
<h2>The trade in retrospect</h2>
<p>So far the Seymour trade has benefitted the Raiders more than it has the Patriots. It remains to be seen whether Nate Solder, player the Pats drafted with the Raiders&#8217; pick, will develop into a Pro Bowl player. But so far, the Patriots have not been able to replace the production Seymour provided on the defensive line. In each of the two years they have been without Seymour, they lost in the first game of the playoffs, giving up 33 and 28 points. It&#8217;s not to say Seymour would have completely changed the outcome of these games, but his ability both to rush the passer and warrant double teams would definitely have helped. On the other side, the Raiders got a great player, voted to the NFL’s “2000&#8217;s All-Decade team,” whose impact on the field is only surpassed by his leadership off it.</p>
<p>Two years ago, the Patriots and Raiders were teams heading in completely different directions, and now, through Week 3, they are each 2-1 and have lost close games to Buffalo. While Seymour can’t be the only reason for this newfound parity, he definitely is one of the biggest reasons for it.</p>

Since 2002, the Raiders have drafted OUT of the top 10 just once, when Bill Callahan led them to Superbowl 37. In three of the years in that span, the Raiders drafted in the top 5 three times.</p>
<p>So, it was safe to assume this would be another bad year on the Bay, right? Not so fast.</p>
<p>In a year that is driven by parity among all 32 NFL teams, the Raiders have risen up as the front runners in the AFC West as the Raiders sit at 5-4 with a 3-0 division record. Part of the reason why the Raiders have had much success this season is due to the play of Seymour. In eight games this season, Seymour has almost matched his production from a year ago, as he&#8217;s on pace to reach a career high in sacks.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/11/20/patriots-2011-draft-report-the-oakland-raiders-turnaround/">Patriots 2011 Draft Report: The Oakland Raiders Turnaround</a> (493 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being a Patriots fans has it&#8217;s positives and negatives. On the good side, there are three championships and annually being a contenders in the National Football League. From top to bottom they are a perfectly run business. The problem? Growing attached to a New England Patriot never ends like you want.</p>
<p>The Pats understand that that NFL is a business. The emotional aspect does not play a factor in Foxboro. Even Randy Moss has predicted that this would be his last season, because that&#8217;s how the Patriots operate. They find the best players and coaches available and implement them to win championships, even if that means getting rid of stalwarts.</p>
<p>New England will get rid of players such as Richard Seymour, Mike Vrabel and maybe even Randy Moss and Stephen Gostkowski, in order to keep fighting long term for Super Bowls. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you helped them win a Super Bowl, are a perennial Pro Bowl member or even a former league MVP, no one is certain in Foxboro. It seems harsh, until you realize that it could be the best business plan in football.<br />

<h2>QB: Tom Brady</h2>
<p><em>Honorable Mention: Drew Bledsoe, Matt Cassel</em></p>
<p>It was the easiest selection on the list. The day Drew Bledsoe was knocked out of a game in 2001, was the day Tom Brady emerged as one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time. He is a three time Super Bowl Champion, (two time MVP), regular season MVP on a team that went undefeated in the regular season, owns the single season touchdown record and still seems to get better each season. He is a two time Sporting News Sportsman of the year, a four time Pro Bowl selection and was a first team all pro selection in 2007. He is the MVP of the last decade for New England and hopefully he can have the same success next decade.</p>
<h2>RB: Kevin Faulk</h2>
<p><em>Honorable Mention: Antowain Smith, Corey Dillon, Laurence Maroney</em></p>
<p>The hardest selection. There is one thing Smith, Dillon and Maroney have in common, they were all backed up by Faulk. Since 1999, Faulk has played in Foxboro and has been a favorite target of Brady. He has over 7,000 all purpose yards and has been on all three Super Bowl Winning teams. Fun fact: He has the most rushing yards for a back that has never had a 100 yard game.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Defensive lineman Richard Seymour now has five days to report to his new team, the Oakland Raiders. Seymour has failed to report to the team since being traded from the Patriots to the Raiders last Sunday. The Patriots received a 2011 first round pick as compensation.</p>
<p>Seymour was sent the &#8220;five-day letter,&#8221; which means he must report within five days, or face league suspension. If Seymour fails to report, he will be suspended for the year, lose his entire $3.685 million salary, and lose the opportunity to seek free agency in the 2010 offseason.</p>
<p>Assuming Seymour doesn&#8217;t report, the Raiders would retain his rights in 2010 at his 2009 salary ($3.685 million), and the Patriots would keep Oakland&#8217;s 2011 first round pick, also known as highway robbery.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/09/11/seymour-must-report-to-raiders-in-5-days/">Seymour Must Report to Raiders in 5 Days</a> (138 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past weekend was an eventful for one for the National Football League and the New England Patriots. Not only did 32 teams across the league cut down their rosters to 53, but the NFL saw a big trade. The Patriots <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/09/06/richard-seymour-traded-to-raiders/">traded all-pro defensive end Richard Seymour</a> to the Oakland Raiders in exchange for a 2011 first round pick.</p>
<p>The trade was a <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/09/08/seymour-trade-leaves-big-hole-and-questions-for-the-future/">brilliant move for the Patriots as Seymour wouldn’t have been re-signed</a> after this season. Now the team can focus on re-signing big free agents to be, Vince Wilfork and Logan Mankins.</p>
<p>The real intrigue with this trade comes with the compensation: that draft pick. History tells us that the Raiders will still be a terrible football team because of Al Davis, so we can pretty much bank on a top ten draft selection comes April 2011. Here are three players that will be <strong>BIG</strong> names in that year.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/09/10/exploring-the-possibilities-2011-nfl-draft/">Exploring the Possibilities: 2011 NFL Draft</a> (1,012 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Patriots traded long-time defensive end Richard Seymour to the Raiders on Sunday for a 2011 first round draft choice.</p>
<p>Seymour, who has been plagued by injuries in recent years, is often seen as one of the staples of the Patriots three Super Bowl championship teams. He reportedly sought a contract extension from the Patriots, and was then told he was traded.</p>
<p>In a corresponding move, the Patriots will sign offensive guard Kendall Simmons, who will fill Seymour&#8217;s roster spot.</p>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>First, getting a first round pick from a bad team like the Raiders is great value for Seymour, who will turn 30 in October. It&#8217;s interesting to note that it&#8217;s a 2011 draft choice, so the Raiders must think they&#8217;ll improve in the next two years, which is definitely possible with Jamarcus Russell, Darren McFadden, and now Richard Seymour. I know Bill Belichick doesn&#8217;t like signing rookies to huge contracts and will probably end up trading the pick, but it gives him great value for the future.</p>
<p>The move was probably made so the team can have more money to sign Vince Wilfork to a contract extension. When Belichick analyzed who was the more valuable defensive lineman, he chose Wilfork over Seymour.</p>
