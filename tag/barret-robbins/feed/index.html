It was so bad that he even played Russian roulette at one point, and luckily came out alive. In 2002 he was diagnosed with the disorder and began treatment and eventually conquered it, but not after having lost his wife. He&#8217;s not alone, though, when it comes to famous athletes with disorders. Ted Johnson suffered from depression after post-concussion syndrome. Zack Greinke suffered from social anxiety disorder. Barret Robbins had Bipolar disorder. And that&#8217;s just the beginning of the list.</p>

However, what we forget is that there is more to an athlete than just that.
