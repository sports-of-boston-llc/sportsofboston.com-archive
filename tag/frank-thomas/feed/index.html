All three were more than deserving of the honor, and one would think they would have their time in the spotlight. Unfortunately, a loud-mouthed reporter with his own agenda, Dan Le Batard, took that away from them. In November 2013, Deadspin announced that they had &#8220;bought&#8221; a Hall of Fame vote and would allow their readers to vote on the names on the ballot. This past Wednesday, Dan Le Batard was announced to be the journalist who &#8220;sold&#8221; his vote. First things first, it is important to note that Le Batard did not actually sell his vote, he merely gave it away. This fact changes the story from something borderline illegal to an ill-timed publicity stunt. For those who have not seen the Deadspin article, you can find it <a href="http://deadspin.com/revealed-the-hall-of-fame-voter-who-turned-his-ballot-1496558341">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Why Le Batard was Right</h2>
<p>While I cannot condone the manner in which it was done, Le Batard is correct in that the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA) and its Hall of Fame voting process is an extremely sketchy process.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2014/01/12/the-hall-of-fame-vote-why-dan-le-batard-was-right-and-wrong/">The Baseball Hall of Fame Vote: Why Dan Le Batard was Right and Wrong</a> (430 words)</p>

He&#8217;s with the kids today, he&#8217;s with the kids all the time in our city.  He makes a difference in young people&#8217;s lives, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;d like to  see him [stay]. Now some ballplayers just do it on the field, he does it  off the field too, which means so much as mayor of the city.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Menino basically says it himself; have Ortiz win multiple championships for the <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/team/_/name/bos/boston-red-sox">Red Sox</a> and then go visit the struggling inner-city kids after. Menino can&#8217;t win championships and he doesn&#8217;t want to go visit all the kids who have hard lives, so he has Ortiz do it and has him do it with a smile.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2011/07/29/mayor-menino-wants-david-ortiz-to-sign-8-year-deal-with-red-sox/">Mayor Menino Wants David Ortiz to Sign 8-Year Deal with Red Sox</a> (669 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s no arguing that <strong>Rich Harden</strong> is one of the most talented pitchers in the major leagues. The one thing preventing him from taking the next big step is his inability to stay healthy. He looked very strong however against the Red Sox Friday night, striking out eight in six innings of work while allowing only two runs. As good as Harden was, Sox starter <strong>Tim Wakefield</strong> was that much worse. His knuckleball wouldn&#8217;t knuckle, his fastball wasn&#8217;t fast enough, and his curveball was flat over five innings of work. Wake allowed eight runs on eight hits and four walks. He allowed yet another HR to old foe <strong>Frank Thomas</strong> in the first inning.<br />

The long road trip for the Red Sox is finally over but it ends with a third straight loss to the Blue Jays, 7-4 today at the Rogers Centre.</p>
<p>Josh Beckett made his first start of the season and pitched decent until running into trouble in the fifth. Beckett had allowed just three hits but walked four when he was taken out with the bases loaded and two out in the fifth. Manny Delcarmen came in and on the first pitch, the &#8220;Big Hurt&#8221; Frank Thomas blasted a monsterous Grand Slam homer to blow the game wide open. It was Thomas&#8217; second homer of the year and he now has 8 RBIs.</p>
<p>The Sox pulled it within 7-4 and had the tying run at the plate in the ninth in Jacoby Ellsbury and Julio Lugo, but a strikeout and pop out respectively ended the game and sent the Sox to a third straight loss north of the border.</p>
<p>The bright side for the Sox is that eight of the nine starters had a hit and they now finally get to return to Boston for their home opener at Fenway Park on Tuesday when they face the Detroit Tigers.</p>
<p><strong>My Take: </strong>Beckett looked decent for his first start of the year, until the fifth of course. His fastball was lively and hitters had a tough time making contact as the ace did strike out six in just 4.2 innings. The wildness displayed should settle down as he gets more innings. The Jays offense sure looks potent with the Vernon Wells, Alex Rios and Frank Thomas trio accounting for 12 RBIs in the series.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh Canada, our neighbors from the north. The Jays once again finished 3rd in the AL East behind the Sox and Yankees. This is no longer the franchise from the glory days of the early 90&#8217;s but there is most definitely some pure talent in this lineup. Of course the notion that Toronto can overcome Boston and New York in the standings is just completely ridiculous. Are there any Blue Jays that can help your fantasy team overcome the odds and bring you to the promise land? Well, in no particular order, here are the major players you should target on draft day.</p>
<p><strong><u>OFFENSE</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Alex Rios, OF:</strong> Rios has just been waiting to burst and this year just may be it. He has been improving every year starting with his almost breakout year in 2006 (Rios was on SportsofBoston&#8217;s KC&#8217;s fantasy team in 2006 and KC takes full blame for cutting his season short). In 2007 Rios hit 24 HR and drove in 85 to compliment his .297 AVG and 17 steals. All signs are pointing to another jump in the numbers. He also just turned 27, and as we all know, the number 27 is the magic number for a fantasy player.</p>
<p><strong>Pete&#8217;s Prediction: 112 R, .303 AVG, 29 HR, 97 RBI, 20 SB</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s a bad pitching match up. A.J. Burnett (8-7, 3.42) has had seven straight quality starts. And in that time hasn&#8217;t allowed more then 3 ER. In the last two starts he&#8217;s allowed only 1 ER and had 8 K&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Jon Lester (4-0, 4.86) in nine starts this year has allowed four or more earned runs five times. In Lester&#8217;s last start he went 3.2 IP against Tampa allowing 4 ER. Lester has never faced Toronto in his 24 career starts. If Frank Thomas doesn&#8217;t hit three home runs again maybe Lester can keep Boston in the game.</p>
<p>No one in Boston&#8217;s lineup has good career success against AJ. Ortiz is 1-5 with a home run. And more like that. Pedroia in his three AB&#8217;s against AJ does have two hits with a homerun. I&#8217;ll take it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lowell hits a three run shot. He now has a 16 game hitting streak. At the start of Lowell&#8217;s hitting streak he was hitting .310. He is now hitting .333. And Lowell now has 99 RBI&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Pedroia got another multi-hit game in his first three! at bats. He is 3-5 so far. Putting his average up to .328. Pedroia has 10 hits in his last 17 at bats.</p>
<p>Jacoby Ellsbury is now hitting close .400, at .397. This kid is the man. Ellsbury has a great mix of plate discipline, contact, speed, and hopefully some growing power.</p>
<p>Big Frank Thomas has 8 infield hits this year. Big man can move.</p>
