<p>In his<a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9892094/rolando-mcclain-trying-get-life-together-tuscaloosa"> interview</a>, McClain told ESPN The Magazine,“I felt like Aaron Hernandez, like I just wanted to kill somebody.” Unlike Hernandez, McClain understood and accepted his life was spinning out of control and decided to take a proactive approach before he ended up seriously hurting himself or someone else.</p>
<p>Despite the fame and fortune that comes with being a professional athlete, McClain made perhaps the smartest decision of his life when he decided to retire from football and focus on regaining control of his life. Very similar to Hernandez, McClain, at the young age of 23, was so full of rage he feared he would do something he would later regret. Unlike Hernandez, he ultimately decided to retire from football before those urges became reality. Leaving behind the stress associated with being a professional athlete, McClain decided to walk away so he could learn to truly be happy in life by learning ways to cope with his anger.</p>
<p>Should Hernandez have been of the same mentality as McClain and retired from football before his anger and self-destructive behavior resulted in murder and incarceration? Could retirement from the game have prevented the above mentioned events from occurring?(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2013/11/03/should-aaron-hernandez-have-retired-from-nfl-before-life-spun-out-of-control/">Should Aaron Hernandez Have Retired From NFL Before Life Spun Out of Control?</a> (725 words)</p>
