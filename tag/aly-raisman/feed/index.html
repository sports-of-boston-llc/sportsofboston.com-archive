<p>Most people may not have known that Nate Ebner was a rugby player at heart. He never played high school football and played rugby at the Ohio State University. After years of rugby and the death of his Father, he decided to try out for the football team at Ohio State in hopes of achieving his dream to play in the NFL. He made the team and also was drafted by the Patriots after college at the 197th pick in the draft. Not only has Nate achieved his dream of playing in the NFL, he also is a Super Bowl Champion with the Patriots.</p>
<p>And even though the Men&#8217;s Rugby Team is eliminated from medal contention from their loss on Wednesday, Ebner has made all of us proud. He&#8217;s a go-getter and when he puts his mind to something, you better believe he&#8217;s going to do it. He said he was going to be an Olympian, and look at him now. His late Father would be proud of him.</p>
<p>Switching gears to women&#8217;s gymnastics, I&#8217;m sure everyone is aware of who Aly Raisman is how much of an impact she has on the Olympics. Aly and her &#8220;Final Five&#8221; squad got Gold in the Women&#8217;s Team Final Tuesday afternoon. The US beat second place Russia by 8.209 points, the largest margin of victory in olympic women&#8217;s gymnastics history. Aly Raisman served as a large impact in the team&#8217;s victory as she put on an absolute clinic during the floor exercise. Her final routine left me in awe. The moves she pulls off are truly extraordinary.</p>
<p>Raisman currently has three gold medals to her name. She will try to make that four gold metals when she attempts to go back to back golds in the individual floor competition.</p>
<p>Ebner and Raisman continue to impress all of us in what they do. Thank you for representing this great country and bring home more golds!</p>
