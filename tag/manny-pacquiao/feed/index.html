He is a congressman in his native Phillipine Islands, started his own political party in the country called the People’s Champ Movement, has released two studio albums, three singles and four music videos. He became a professional boxer as a 14-year-old to earn a living (he had been sleeping on the streets in the Philippine slums for years after running away from home when his father ate his dog amidst an argument).</p>

He is only the second fighter ever to go an entire round without being hit and won the highest-grossing boxing match of all time in a controversial bout with Oscar De La Hoya.
