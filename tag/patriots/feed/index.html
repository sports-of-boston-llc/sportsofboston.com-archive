Is it not exciting to be a die hard fan of one of the most potent teams, year in and year out? In such a weak division, the playoffs are usually a lock, and this year will be no different.</p>
<p>The most exciting offseason move for the Patriots thus far was the acquisition of Martellus Bennett, who himself stated that he was excited to play the role of Robin, as Gronk is already Batman.</p>
<p>Combined with Bennett, the Patriots also signed Chris Long and Nate Washington. Three veteran players who are excited to join a winning franchise could add up to a hefty sum of money, but not if you&#8217;re Bill Belichick-all three players combine for a salary cap hit of less than ten million dollars.</p>

(AP Photo/Weston Kenney)" ></a><p>Last week, three questions on offense for the Patriots were discussed. This week the focus is on defense, as the Patriots prepare for mini camp on June 7th.</p>
<p>With the departure of Chandler Jones, which was likely a move to save money, the Patriots have an obvious vacancy at pass rusher that could be filled by more than a few viable players. The Patriots had 49 sacks in the regular season last year, and 12.5 of those belonged to Jones.</p>
<p>The Patriots did add a few veterans, some with more to play for than others. For example, Chris Long has played for the Los Angeles Rams for eight years, and has not been to the playoffs during his tenure. New England will be a different environment for players like Long, and Belichick is prepared to make his team a defensive force once again.</p>

Without a first round pick, none of these players are particularly spectacular, but most, according to NFL Scouting Reports, seem coach-able. Regardless, all nine will be fighting for their jobs when training camp rolls up in late July. So without further ado, all nine picks (complete with reasoning as to why Belichick may have been interested).</p>
<p><strong>#60 overall: Cyrus Jones (5&#8217;10&#8221;, 197), CB, Alabama:</strong> As a fifteen game starter last year, Jones had two interceptions. This may not seem overly impressive, but Jones is a versatile cornerback that should fit well into a nickel system. What is interesting about this cornerback is his punt-returning ability. Jones returned 42 punts for a 12.6 average, complete with four touchdowns. This could provide immediate relief for already beleaguered wide receivers Danny Amendola and Julian Edelman.</p>
<p><strong>#78 overall: Joe Thuney (6&#8217;5&#8243;, 304), OL, North Carolina State: </strong>Thuney, a three year starter at NC State is a valuable player because he has spent time at every position on the offensive line. Versatility and flexibility in terms of position is a trait that Belichick appreciates (e.g. Troy Brown and Julian Edelman both spending time at CB in seasons past). Currently, the Patriots unofficial depth chart lists Thuney as a left guard, but this could change quickly depending on need.</p>
<p><strong>#91 overall: Jacoby Brissett (6&#8217;4&#8243;, 231), QB, North Carolina State: </strong>In 2015, Brissett led the Wolfpack to a 7-6 record, throwing for 2,662 yards, 20 touchdowns, and 6 interceptions. This is a mobile quarterback that rushed for over 300 yards, paired with 6 touchdowns, and is seemingly competition for Garroppolo. Brissett will still begin the season third on the depth chart, behind a suspended Brady and Garroppolo (who will be completely overwhelmed in Week 1).</p>
<p><strong>#96 overall: Vincent Valentine (6&#8217;4&#8243;, 329), DT, Nebraska: </strong>Last year, Valentine, after recovering from a knee injury that more or less sidelined him for the first half of the year, started seven games, recording ten tackles and three sacks. Valentine was likely picked up for his size, which is reminiscent of Vince Wilfork. Both are able to draw the attention of double teams (but only one has proved himself on an NFL level).</p>
<p><strong>#112 overall: Malcolm Mitchell (6&#8217;0&#8243;, 198), WR, Georgia: </strong>With some grooming, Mitchell might develop into a dependable receiver for Brady to look to. NESN.com reports that Mitchell only had 3 drops on 93 targets in 2015 (compare with Julian Edelman, who had eight drops on 88 targets). To make matters more interesting, Mitchell&#8217;s NFL scouting report iterates how he is able to make the tough, contested catches across the middle.</p>
<p><strong>#208 overall: Kamu Grugier-Hill (6&#8217;2&#8243;, 215), OLB, Eastern Illinois: </strong>Eastern Illinois&#8217; Pro Day turned out to be wildly beneficial for Grugier-Hill. The linebacker was able to add a 38.5&#8243; vertical leap and a 4.45 forty yard dash to his resume, which is rounded out nicely by his 2015 campaign: 70 tackles, 6.5 sacks, 3 fumble recoveries, and a single interception.</p>
<p><strong>#214 overall: Elandon Roberts (6&#8217;0&#8243;, 235), ILB, Houston: </strong>Defenses need someone who is able to be a coach on the field, and with the departure of Jerod Mayo, the Patriots are seemingly lacking in that department. Enter Elandon Roberts, complete with a scouting report (from NFL.com) with buzz words such as &#8220;leader&#8221;, &#8220;passion&#8221;, and &#8220;coach&#8217;s dream&#8221;. The downside? &#8220;Slow to accelerate&#8221;. &#8220;Below average speed&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>#221 overall: Ted Karras (6&#8217;3&#8243;, 307), OG, Illinois: </strong>A captain during his senior year, Karras possesses one statistic that Belichick could not ignore; Karras has committed only two penalties over his last two seasons. At 307 pounds, Karras was able to open up running lanes consistently at the college level. Whether this will translate to the NFL or not remains to be seen, but the 4-year starter is planning on it.</p>
<p><strong>#225 overall: Devin Lucien (6&#8217;2&#8243;, 195), WR, Arizona State: </strong>According to Pro Football Focus, Lucien had only three drops on 98 targets in 2015. Wide receivers with steady hands are a hot commodity in New England at the moment, and the ASU receiver opened eyes with his last three games, in which he had 534 yards and 5 touchdowns. This is certainly a low-risk/high-reward pick to round things out.</p>

<p>Brady&#8217;s next logical step is to appeal the ruling to have the enter second circuit court of appeals to hear the case, which currently has 2-2 record with federal judges. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s a slim chance that the court will hear the case&#8230; and an even slimmer chance that the case is heard by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

The legendary offensive line coach retired after the 2013 season after having spent two decades coaching in New England. His replacement, Dave DeGuglielmo, had an up and down tenure in New England that ranged from a line that under-performed at times to a Super Bowl victory.</p>
<p>The play of the New England&#8217;s offensive line was the biggest issue in their AFC Championship loss to Denver and bringing Scarnecchia back would provide an instant upgrade. The Patriots still need to address the tackle position, however. Nate Solder and Sebastian Vollmer have had injury issues and Marcus Cannon is a reserve player at best. Getting a quality third tackle will go  along way towards solving the Patriots&#8217; problems.</p>
<p>Scarnecchia is a Hall of Fame level assistant coach who has routinely gotten the best out of his players. It is a major reason why he lasted through the regimes of several different head coaches and why some unheralded linemen became Super Bowl Champions. Many of the players on the roster have played under him and are comfortable with his style and respect his coaching acumen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The familiarity that Scarnecchia brings to the table is a major selling point for him. He has had success in New England in the past and specifically with many of the same players that are still in Foxboro. Bill Belichick trusts him and Tom Brady will feel more comfortable knowing who is coaching his protectors. It is not set in stone yet, but it would be surprising at this point if he does not come back. Patriots fans should feel happy if he does; he won&#8217;t fix all of New England&#8217;s issues, but he will greatly improve a unit that was a black eye in the AFC Championship game.</p>

I felt like my heart had been replaced with a furnace stockpiled with everyone’s Christmas coal. I was devastated- mostly because people gave Peyton credit where it wasn’t due. That reared its ugly head in the SB where he got punished nationwide (excuse the pun) 43-8.

There were several factors in the loss, but none bigger than the play of the Patriots offensive line. Tom Brady was hit 20 times and was constantly under pressure. Von Miller, Demarcus Ware and Derek Wolfe dominated the Patriots front throughout the game.</p>
<p>New England struggled to move the ball until the fourth quarter and even then they had two drives end on failed fourth down conversions. On each of those failed conversions, Brady faced pressure. Brady also faced pressure on both of his interceptions, but neither was a good decision by him. Even the patented Patriots style of throwing before the rush could arrive was not effective throughout the game because the rush was supremely fast and the Broncos secondary played a great game. The injury earlier this season to left tackle Nate Solder made a large impact in this game, with Marcus Cannon routinely getting beat by Miller and Sebastian Vollmer having some struggles against Ware.</p>
<p>Despite this the Patriots still nearly tied the game on a two point conversion try with 12 seconds left. It is a disappointing end to a season that had the Patriots aiming for their fifth Lombardi Trophy. New England is fortunate that many of their key players are locked up going into next season and they will be getting reinforcements returning for 2016. However, with Solder coming off injury and Vollmer not getting any younger, it would behoove the Patriots to invest in a tackle in this year&#8217;s draft.</p>
<p>In the end, the 2015 Patriots started out like a team that could beat anyone but injuries and a few key mistakes led to their demise. Much can be debated about the finish to their regular season and today&#8217;s game, but the overriding theme in the end of their season was the offensive line getting beat consistently.</p>

He’s literally been to more Championship games than most other franchises have been. If that’s not saying something, I honestly don’t know what will. The guy is a King, a true warrior of the game. It doesn’t surprise me we’re here again, and it won’t when we get there next year, too (you heard it here first).  And I’m not even worried a smidge about the game being in Denver. Who cares?</p>
<p>People try to compare this thing to the 2014 AFC Championship game. I’m sorry, what? The two are literally incomparable. That game, we had no Gronk or Wilfork, and Welker took out Talib during the game. It was as close as Manning could get to playing against a Junior High School defense. But that’s all in the past. I don’t care anymore. We all know what happened to the lowly Broncos anyways; they got spanked on national television by the Seahawks.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2016/01/23/the-brady-bowl-and-why-peyton-may-be-in-trouble/">The Brady Bowl, and Why Peyton May be in Trouble</a> (293 words)</p>

The cause of the hospitalization has not been made public.</p>
<p>Jones arrived at the Foxborough police department on Sunday morning and was evaluated by five officers and subsequently taken to the hospital. An officer was also sent to Jones&#8217; home in order to &#8220;secure the residence.&#8221;</p>
<p>While acknowledging that Jones had been to the hospital, the Patriots said in a statement that Jones had shown up for work on Monday and not missed any meetings or practice.  The Foxborough Police Department initially did not acknowledge that it dealt with Jones but later did and added that it was due to a &#8220;medical call.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this point, details are not easy to come across and it does not appear that this incident will affect Jones&#8217; status for the team&#8217;s playoff game on Saturday. Things could change between now and then and this story bears monitoring over the next several days.</p>
