As I’m driving home Sunday afternoon I tuned in to the second half of the Red Sox game in Detroit. I’m listening to Joe Castiglione when I realize I have no idea who is playing where defensively for the Red Sox. Joe then informs me that Jackie Bradley is in centerfield with Castillo and de Aza in the corner outfield slots, and the infield consists of Holt at third, Bogaerts at short, Josh Rutledge at second, and Travis Shaw at first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Initially I was slightly taken aback by some of the names out there, but when I thought about it a little more I realized it’s not a bad thing at all that these guys are getting reps. Sure, I would love to see the Sox in a pennant race right now with the star players like Pedroia and Ortiz leading the way, but given the circumstances of this season I think the rest of the season is a great opportunity to get the younger, unproven players a chance to showcase their talents. Whether or not they are ultimately on the Red Sox roster in a few years, these guys could important pieces to the puzzle. It’s a whole new look out there for the remainder of 2015, but I don’t hate it. Here is why:</span></p>
<p><strong>Jackie Bradley Jr.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On Sunday JBJ had maybe the best game of his career. He went two for three with 5 RBI and made an absolutely stunning catch near the center field wall with his back to home plate. This is a guy that many Red Sox fans have written off and moved on from, and his struggles at the MLB level are well noted. At this point he probably feels like it is him against the city of Boston. He is trying to silence the doubters and prove that he can hit. I have to say that I’m a believer and it&#8217;s not just because he had one outstanding game. I have been a supporter ever since he took the time to shake my hand in passing as a spectator at a Sea Dogs game last year. Sometimes its the little things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jackie Bradley Jr. is an elite defensive outfielder. For some evidence take a peek at this</span><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dp8qJAonaE"> <span style="font-weight: 400">video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. If you want the short version you can skip ahead to 4:08 and JBJ will showcase all his abilities in one single play. He makes tough plays look easy (2:47), has a tremendous arm strength (0:58), and can make the spectacular diving play (1:19). Defensively he is absolutely ready to play in MLB and that his bat is the only question mark. The way he plays the outfield he can be an asset to a team if he hits anywhere above .260, his defensive abilities are that superb. Even if the Red Sox front office decides to give up on him and move on, Jackie Bradley Jr. has an MLB career in his future. It is just a matter of time for him to get comfortable at the new level. I’m hoping he hits to the front office’s satisfaction the rest of this year season because I would love to see him in the Red Sox uniform for years to come.</span></p>
<p><strong>Rusney Castillo</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rusney was playing right field last night and had a solid offensive day. I am glad to see him getting an opportunity to play for the Red Sox because I think it is the only way he is going to get comfortable in professional baseball. There is no question he is a very talented player and it is only a matter of time before he figures it out. I just think he has felt the pressure of playing in Boston and the expectations associated with a big money deal like the one he signed. The rest of the 2015 season presents Rusney a tremendous opportunity and he has a real chance to earn the Red Sox’ trust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I personally would prefer to see Rusney in left field. As Brendan</span><a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/08/10/rusney-castillos-open-audition/#more-85322"> <span style="font-weight: 400">eluded to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a couple of days ago Rusney’s defense in nothing to write home about, but Castillo could learn to master the Green Monster similar to Manny Ramirez back in the day (Say what you want about Manny’s overall defense but he did know what he was doing when the ball rebounded off of the Monster). In last night’s game against the Marlins we saw JBJ in left and Rusney in right. I would prefer to see JBJ in center with Mookie in right and Castillo in left, but when it boils down to it any combination of those three players is a scary outfield to opposing teams. No matter what happens I hope both of these guys stay on the Red Sox for the next few years because they have the ability to help a championship caliber baseball team.</span></p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rest of 2015 still has plenty to offer diehard Red Sox fans. Although the losses will likely continue to pile up it is the opportunity that has been presented to the inexperienced players that offers promise. If the Red Sox were in the middle of a pennant race Castillo and JBJ would not get the same chances they’re now seeing on a daily basis. Instead the Red Sox are getting prepared for 2016 and beyond. Imagine if both Rusney and Bradley Jr. perform well enough that the 2016 outfield features both of them with Mookie… That is a good outfield. Now all we need in the remainder of 2015 is Joe Kelly in the bullpen and for Hanley to play some first base and the Red Sox 2016 campaign would be off to great start.</span></p>
