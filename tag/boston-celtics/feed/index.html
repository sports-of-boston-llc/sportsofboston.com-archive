<p><strong>The Red Sox</strong></p>
<p>With the all-star break behind us it&#8217;s time for The Sox to focus on the second half of the season.  The Red Sox started on the road against their arch rival Yankees who are having a terrible year.  Stephen Wright got the ball in game 1 of the series and was well rested since he wasn&#8217;t allowed to pitch in the all-star game, (Which is another story in itself).  The Yankees couldn&#8217;t touch Wright until the 6th inning, but with Boston bats hitting 3 Homeruns it was to much for The Yankees to handle.  Game 2 of the series was all about Eduardo Rodriguez, he went 7 innings while only giving up 1 earned run.  Oh, and Sandy Leon hit a 3 run homerun, what a find he has been for this team.  It is important The Sox get all the wins they can now, the end of their season is a gauntlet with more than half of their games on the road.</p>
<p><strong>The Celtics</strong></p>
<p>Trade rumors have been all the talk in Boston.  Blake Griffin? Russell Westbrook? Jahlil Okafor?  Nobody really knows if The Celtics will make a deal, and who it will be for.  As a Celtic fan you have to be excited, there&#8217;s hope around this team right now.  If The Celtics are to land one of these players I think they&#8217;ll be seeing Cleveland in The Eastern Conference Finals.</p>
<p><strong>The Patriots</strong></p>
<p>Jimmy Garoppolo is the starting quarterback for The Patriots for the first four games of the season.  There has been mixed feelings around if Brady made the right decision or not.  However, taking the suspension now is the smart play, I&#8217;d rather have Brady missing the first four then the last four.  This suspension will also be good for this teams future, either the league sees that Garoppolo can be a starter in this league and we trade him.  Garoppolo plays really well and Belichick keeps him around to one day take over for Brady. Or worst case scenario, Garoppolo plays terrible and The Pats start off the season with a losing record.  All and all I think The Pats will be just fine, and that a pissed off Brady coming back is bad for the NFL.</p>

<p>The Celtics recently lost out on the Kevin Durant sweepstakes when he opted to sign with the Golden State Warriors on July 4th, but now it looks like Danny Ainge is trying to acquire the other superstar player from OKC and bring him in to the current crop of C&#8217;s players, including newly signed big man Al Horford.</p>
<p>Oklahoma City obviously lost a huge part of their team when Durant left town and with only one year remaining on his contract, Thunder management must figure they should ship Westbrook off now and get something for him, instead of letting him enter free agency next summer where he could potentially leave for nothing.</p>
<p>The C&#8217;s are in prime position to deal for Westbrook because of the plethora of valuable trade-chips they have including young players like Avery Bradley or Marcus Smart, any of the six selections from this years draft, and most notably, the remaining Brooklyn Nets picks that project to be high lottery selections once again.</p>
<p>Adding Westbrook to this Celtics squad would make them the runaway favorites as the one team that could challenge the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference, as well as an instantly more exciting team due to Westbrook&#8217;s electric, sometimes over-the-top, style of play.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is since this will be Westbrook&#8217;s contract year, there is no guarantee he will resign next summer when his deal expires. This could affect the value of a potential trade for Westbrook in which Ainge uses this as leverage so he doesn&#8217;t have to give up as much to get him.</p>
<p>No matter what may happen these next few weeks, the Celtics are clearly showing they aren&#8217;t messing around this offseason and are serious about winning a title within the next few years. Although Westbrook might not put them over the top, they&#8217;ll be much closer to glory than most and will be one fun team to watch next season.</p>

It&#8217;s all happening! Everything is awesome! It&#8217;s not a stretch to say that yesterday was the biggest day in the Groesbeck/Ainge/Stevens era in Boston. Danny was finally able to close that elusive big-name free agent, and Wyc was able to make good on his promise of &#8220;fireworks&#8221; that the fan base has been waiting on for what feels like centuries. Sure, $113 million over four years seems like a pretty penny, but with the money being thrown around this offseason and the huge cap increase on the horizon next season, Horford&#8217;s deal is actually somewhat of a bargain.</p>
<p>Horford&#8217;s game will fit seamlessly within the Brad Stevens system. He provides a much needed presence at the rim, and gives the C&#8217;s the go-to fourth quarter scoring option that they were sorely missing in last year&#8217;s playoffs. I cannot WAIT to see Isaiah and Horford running the pick and pop down the throats of the entire Eastern Conference come October.</p>
<p>By no means is Al Horford a perfect player, as evidence by his lackluster performance in the playoffs last season against these Celtics. He struggles defensively at times, particularly on the perimeter defending the pick and roll. The C&#8217;s team approach to defense should help to conceal some of Horford&#8217;s defensive deficiencies over the course of the season.</p>
<p>Hot damn, the Celtics are officially back. They finally landed a big name free-agent for the first time in the history of the franchise, (Go ahead look it up, I&#8217;ll wait) and they got a guy who WANTS to play in Boston. KD or not, this signing was a huge step in the right direction for this franchise. If TB12, Big Papi, and Julian Edleman have anything to do with it, Kevin Durant will be donning Celtic green next season in the city of champions. What a time to be a Celtics fan. What a time to be alive.</p>

Tom Brady, the GOAT, was in attendance at the meeting to help Danny Ainge in the recruitment of Durant. Also David Ortiz would have been there to help but he was busy nuking baseballs into the stands at Fenway.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Kevin Durant needs to come to Boston. The Celts just signed All-Star Al Horford to a four year 113 million dollar deal, Isaiah Thomas is our point guard, Brad Stevens is the head coach, and the team is only improving. If Durant signs with Boston, they immediately become a contender for the NBA Finals. This new big three of Thomas, Horford, and Durant would be absurd. Three legitimate elite players on the same team would do some damage next season so it only makes sense for Kevin to play for the Celtics and he has to know that.</p>
<p>One thing I hope Kevin understands is just how praised he will be in Boston. Players in the NBA know that Boston fans are different. We&#8217;re the most passionate fans out there and we are always there supporting our team through the good and the ugly. Al Horford told his Dad that part of the reason he signed with the Celtics is because of the fans. He knows that when he steps foot on the hardwood in the Garden wearing that green jersey, everyone is going to go nuts for him. If Kevin Durant does the same, he will become loved beyond belief in Boston and I know that for a fact. And hey it&#8217;s Boston&#8230;who doesn&#8217;t love it here?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what was said in Durant&#8217;s meeting with the Celtics but I do know one thing. Ainge most definitely told Durant that if he comes to Boston, he will become a Celtic legend, just like he told Isaiah. So please Kevin, make the right and best decision of your life and play for the best basketball franchise ever.</p>

<p>Al Horford has been recruited by Durant to come to OKC for some time now.  So The Celtics acquiring Horford makes the Celtics pitch that much more intriguing.  Horford is a top 20 player in the NBA, and with Isaiah already in green, The Celtics could put serious pressure on The Cavs if Durant is to choose Boston.  The fact that just hours after The meeting with The Celtics, Durant informed The Clippers he would not be signing with them is very interesting.</p>
<p>I am really starting to think that this could actually happen, and if it does, perhaps Brady&#8217;s number 12 should be retired in the rafters at the TD Garden.</p>

Clippers, The Thunder, and yes The Boston Celtics.</p>
<p>Think about this list, a team that just broke the regular season wins record, a team who recently won back to back championships, the best team of the last 10 plus years, a team that has Cp3 and Blake Griffin, and the team that drafted him.  This is the brass of the NBA (besides Cleveland).  Yes, The Celtics are more than likely number 6 on this list, however at least they are on it.  This list does not include the glamour of The Lakers, the bright lights of New York, it doesn&#8217;t include Houston were James Harden resides, and most surprisingly The Washington Wizards (Durant&#8217;s hometown) did not make the cut.</p>
<p>The Celtic&#8217;s just being on this list speaks volumes, this could single-handedly make Boston more intriguing to free agents.   For years Boston has been laying the groundwork to become a destination for free agents, and finally there is a glimmer of hope.  Hope that free agents can see the history of The Celtics, see the banners in the rafters, and see that this team with Brad Stevens has the potential to be a contender in the east.  The Celtics are also the only team that will meet with Durant that has room for 2 max contracts.</p>
<p>Do I think Durant will be in green next season?  No I don&#8217;t. However if the meeting goes well, and Durant signs a one year deal in OKC and tests free agency again in 2017 then I think there is a real chance it could happen.  Durant and his people hear the plan, Ainge executes it and next season Durant entertains the idea of Boston again.  Remember Celtic fans, Ainge started recruiting Kevin Garnett 3 years prior to trading for him.  Could we see history repeat itself?</p>

<p>Kevin Love is having one of the worst Finals ever, and it looks much worse since he is making nearly 20 million dollars this season.  Love is averaging 7 points a game and has shot .369 in this seasons finals, and besides game 1 when he grabbed 13 rebounds he has been pretty much invisible on the glass.  Oh, he also sat out that game because of a &#8220;concussion&#8221; which I think was an excuse for Tyronn Lue to sit him down.  Love is not a tough basketball player and comes up small in big games.  With this being said I would still be open to the fact of him in Boston.  Given it&#8217;s the right deal and The Celtics don&#8217;t have to give up much then go get him.  If you bring Love into Boston he instantly becomes the best player on the team.</p>
<p><strong>Harrison Barnes </strong></p>
<p>Being a Duke fan it pains me to say this, but I do like Harrison Barnes as a player.  Barnes is only averaging 9 points in the finals.  He is only shooting .361 from the field.  However I&#8217;d be willing to bet he plays well tonight, he seems to play well when his team needs him the most.  Yes I know, Barnes has shot 2 for 22 in the last 2 games, but as any basketball player knows it only takes seeing a couple to go in to get in a rhythm.  I compare Barnes to a James Harden type player, when you took Harden out of OKC he thrived, I think the same can be done with Barnes.  Would love to see him in Boston, however DO NOT give him a max deal.</p>

<p>Isaiah has only been in Boston for more than a year.  Since then he has played his best basketball of his career.  Last season he averaged 22.2 points per game, averaged 6.2 assists per game, and shot nearly 50 percent from the floor.  Isaiah averaged more points per game than Kyrie Irving, and Chris Paul, tho many people will overlook the points per game stat, Isaiah got the best in the head to head match against Paul and Irving.  Isaiah also averaged two more wins above replacement than Irving did.  Personally I would take Isaiah over these two point guards any day, Isaiah plays better than both of these players in &#8220;crunch time&#8221;.</p>
<p>With Curry and now Paul passing on the upcoming olympics Isaiah should get a shot.  The international game would be perfect for Isaiah, shorter 3 point line, more of uptempo play style, plus Isaiah would be able to play with some of the other greats in the NBA today.</p>
<p>Coach K make the right decision and give the little guy a shot.</p>

There have been rumors of many teams that Durant may have interest in joining including the Celtics, Warriors, Heat, Lakers, Magic, Trail Blazers, Spurs, Mavericks, and possibly returning to the Thunder.</p>
<p>There have also been rumors of Durant&#8217;s agent sending a list to the Celtics of players that Kevin wants if he&#8217;s going to come to Boston. We don&#8217;t know if this is true but I wouldn&#8217;t doubt it. Durant has come so close to the NBA Finals too many times. If he wants to leave the Thunder he needs to know that the players on his new team are legit and will give him a chance to win a championship. We do know that Durant wants a &#8220;Big 3&#8221; type deal with a new team if he decides to leave the Thunder. If he came to Boston he would already have point guard Isaiah Thomas who is starting to look like a superstar in this league. If the Celtics want their chance at landing Durant in Boston they need to acquire another dominant player.</p>
<h2>Other Possible Players for the Celtics</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Al Horford</strong>
<ul>
<li>Dominant big man who can space the floor</li>
<li>Can do a little bit of everything</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Jimmy Butler</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gifted athletically</li>
<li>Very good scorer to the basket</li>
<li>Outstanding defensive player</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Hassan Whiteside</strong>
<ul>
<li>One of the best defensive centers in the NBA</li>
<li>Very good rebounder (averaged 11.8 REB per game last season)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Buddy Hield</strong>
<ul>
<li>Good three point shooter</li>
<li>Hasn&#8217;t established himself yet but could be threat right away in the NBA</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The list goes on.</p>
<p>Who knows what&#8217;s going to happen but from what we&#8217;re hearing, the Celtics seem like they are completely serious about landing some big name players. However many people don&#8217;t see it as a realistic possibility for Durant to come play for Boston. I also bet many people never thought Pierce, Garnett, and Allen would be a thing but look what happened. The trade deadline is about as month away so there could be some big news for Boston this month.</p>
<p>Also I don&#8217;t know how many people saw this but on May 31st at 1:15 AM, Isaiah Thomas tweeted a number 35 with a four leaf clover emoji next to it, but he shortly deleted the tweet after. You can take it however you want but this only made me more confident that Isaiah is luring Durant to come play for Boston.</p>

As we all so painfully remember, the Spurs ended up with that coveted first pick, and the dark cloud of draft day despair has been hanging over the Celtics ever since.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2016/05/18/celtics-get-3-at-draft-lottery-where-do-we-go-from-here/">Celtics Get #3 at Draft Lottery: Where do we go from here?</a> (707 words)</p>
