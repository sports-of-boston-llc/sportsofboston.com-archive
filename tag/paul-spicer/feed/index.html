				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jaguars defensive end Paul Spicer has come out reiterating his comments from earlier in the season when he suggested that the Patriots should be barred from the playoffs because of the Spygate scandal. His quote from before the season:</p>
<blockquote><p> &#8220;Do like the NCAA and kick them out of the playoffs or something,&#8221; Spicer told The Associated Press after news of the scandal broke. &#8220;Put them on probation; they can&#8217;t go to no playoff games. Roger Goodell has definitely enforced some new rules. He&#8217;s been hard on players. Now let&#8217;s see how hard he&#8217;s going to be with a team.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>After the Jags win over the Steelers, Spicer said he stood by his comments.</p>
<p>Many teams this season have given the Patriots some bulletin board material, most notably Steelers safety Anthony Smith (who?),  but Rodney Harrison said yesterday that because it&#8217;s a playoff game, no extra motivation is needed:</p>
<blockquote><p>“If you need something like that to get you pumped up for a playoff game, you’re crazy. The playoffs and the intensity of this game, it brings enough excitement and butterflies and all that other stuff. It just comes down to who is more physical, who wants it more, who makes more plays. It has nothing to do with what happened four, five months ago.”</p></blockquote>
