Specifically, this is what he had to say: “Over a billion dollars has been paid to seven chronically uncompetitive teams, five of whom have had baseball&#8217;s highest operating profits. Who, except these teams, can think this is a good idea?” Well if you put it that way John, that actually makes a whole hell of a lot of sense.</p>
<p>First of all, 500k MLB? Pump the brakes. To give you a little context, $500,000 is the same amount that <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2007/09/13/pats-lose-pick-belichick-fined/">Belichick was fined for ‘Spygate.”</a> And that was cheating! This is actually calling someone out for good reason. Sounds like someone has a sore spot, eh? More on that to come. But this is like getting fined $10,000 for calling your boss out for throwing like a girl in the company softball game.</p>
<p>Second of all, I thought this was America! You know, where freedom, and specifically freedom of speech reigns? All types of yahoos get to speak their mind in this country with no consequences. Just watch Fox News some night. So why penalize someone that has a lucid, intelligent remark? Well, if I could fine people for calling me out publicly for my inadequacies I probably would too. But, let&#8217;s take a close look and what Mr. Henry is all hot and bothered about.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2011/03/04/john-henrys-500k-fine-implicates-mlb-revenue-sharing-bud-selig-more/">John Henry&#8217;s $500K Fine Implicates MLB Revenue Sharing &#038; Bud Selig More</a> (1,976 words)</p>

(Photo from of freakingnews.com)" ></a><p>If there is one sport that didn’t need to be kicked while it’s down its baseball. Across MLB, numbers are down ranging from butts in the seats to viewership at home. Boston is a perfect microcosm for the nationwide epidemic. Not even five years removed from their last World Series championship and, seemingly, no one in gives a crap. If you read the papers or listen to any semblance of sports radio you know attendance is down at Fenway plus NESN’s rating are in a tailspin. The pink hats got bored with the actual game and went home. Why?</p>
<p>Well, the laundry lists of reasons why baseball is waning is another conversation. And it’s a lengthy one. Hell, there was an <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2010/08/17/losses_piling_up_lately_for_areas_scalpers_at_fenway_park/" target="_blank">article in the Globe last week about a scalper</a> that’s complaining that he used to make six figures selling Sox tickets now he’s struggling to make $20,000. I almost threw up when I read that article. But really, the scalping system has gotten so bloated in Boston, it&#8217;s strangling the life out of the city’s once vibrant baseball fan base (and that vivid effervescence had nothing to do with the pink hats). Now this guy has the audacity to complain? Please. He’s a victim of his own doing.</p>
<h2>The System is Broken</h2>
<p>In my opinion all this controversy about the recently leaked financial documents brings to light three issues. Number one, this is proof positive that the system is broken. Obviously. Don’t get me wrong: I like no salary cap. It’s quintessential American. If you’ve got the money, spend it. You work your ass off, put out a quality product that people like to see, manage your business and make a boatload. Go for it, spend that dough. I even like revenue sharing. If done right it does even the playing field. But, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to realize that there should be benchmarks set in terms of how much of the revenue sharing money teams need to sink back into the organization. How can that not be obvious? This leads me to my next point.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/08/27/leak-of-mlb-team-financial-reports-just-another-epitaph-on-baseballs-tombstone/">Leak of MLB Team Financial Reports Just Another Epitaph on Baseball&#8217;s Tombstone</a> (324 words)</p>
