After 2014, even though I kept telling myself I wasn’t mad, I was burning on the inside. It felt like the Salem Witch Trial people were burning a witch to death next to my heart. I felt like my heart had been replaced with a furnace stockpiled with everyone’s Christmas coal. I was devastated- mostly because people gave Peyton credit where it wasn’t due. That reared its ugly head in the SB where he got punished nationwide (excuse the pun) 43-8.

There were several factors in the loss, but none bigger than the play of the Patriots offensive line. Tom Brady was hit 20 times and was constantly under pressure. Von Miller, Demarcus Ware and Derek Wolfe dominated the Patriots front throughout the game.</p>
<p>New England struggled to move the ball until the fourth quarter and even then they had two drives end on failed fourth down conversions. On each of those failed conversions, Brady faced pressure. Brady also faced pressure on both of his interceptions, but neither was a good decision by him. Even the patented Patriots style of throwing before the rush could arrive was not effective throughout the game because the rush was supremely fast and the Broncos secondary played a great game. The injury earlier this season to left tackle Nate Solder made a large impact in this game, with Marcus Cannon routinely getting beat by Miller and Sebastian Vollmer having some struggles against Ware.</p>
<p>Despite this the Patriots still nearly tied the game on a two point conversion try with 12 seconds left. It is a disappointing end to a season that had the Patriots aiming for their fifth Lombardi Trophy. New England is fortunate that many of their key players are locked up going into next season and they will be getting reinforcements returning for 2016. However, with Solder coming off injury and Vollmer not getting any younger, it would behoove the Patriots to invest in a tackle in this year&#8217;s draft.</p>
<p>In the end, the 2015 Patriots started out like a team that could beat anyone but injuries and a few key mistakes led to their demise. Much can be debated about the finish to their regular season and today&#8217;s game, but the overriding theme in the end of their season was the offensive line getting beat consistently.</p>

(AP Photo/Joe Mahoney)" ></a><p>Now that we&#8217;ve all had a full 24 hours to digest the frustrating monstrosity that was Sunday Night Football, we can rationally examine the remains. While it was fun to imagine this team really sticking it to the whole league and going 16-0 everyone knew just how hard that task would be. Every team in the league has to deal with injuries and atrocious officiating every single week, but Sunday night was the culmination of a season of that frustration for the previously undefeated Patriots. After losing key offensive weapons three consecutive weeks in Dion Lewis, Julian Edelman, and Danny Amendola, they narrowly escaped another major knee injury to Rob Gronkowski. The NFL referees have been astonishingly awful all season for every team but they really showed up to play for prime time. Unfortunately they were playing for the Broncos.</p>
<p>&#8211; It&#8217;s easy to write me off as biased and a homer for claiming the refs weren&#8217;t doing the Patriots any favors. However all it takes is a small semblance of a brain to realize the penalties called late in the game were a huge reason Sunday went the way it did. With just under 12 minutes to go in the third quarter and the Patriots up 21-14 Brady hit KeShawn Martin with a 51-yard bomb that was called back for holding on Tre Jackson. With just under five minutes to go in the game Brady hit Gronk on 3rd-and-5 for a 10-yard completion which was of course called back on Gronk&#8217;s fifth offensive pass interference call of the season. The holding on Jackson was borderline and the defender initiated the contact with Gronk, who never even extended his arm. (...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/12/01/notes-and-observations-week-12-patriots-lose-1st-game-in-frustrating-fashion-broncos-win-in-ot-30-24/">Notes and Observations Week 12: Patriots Lose 1st Game in Frustrating Fashion; Broncos Win in OT 30-24</a> (1,139 words)</p>

They will, however, be treated to one of the most captivating battles of the entire football season: the Patriots offense vs the Broncos defense. Each unit is the best at what it does. The Patriots offense has scored at least 20 points in every game despite several key injuries and the Broncos defense has been absolutely suffocating with just 284 yards per game allowed and 18.3 points per game given up.<br />
When two units that do so many things well meet on the field, things generally come down to a handful of individual matchups and this game is no different. The two things that will most determine who wins this clash are how the Broncos will cover Rob Gronkowski and how the Patriots will block Von Miller.</p>
<p>Aqib Talib could be asked to cover Rob Gronkowski, similar to when he covered Jimmy Graham as a member of the Patriots. Talib held Graham to zero catches in that game and did a masterful job sticking with the tight end throughout. Still, Gronkowski is better than Graham and Talib will have his hands full if asked to stay with the mammoth Patriots tight end. The Buffalo Bills played a lot of zone on Monday night and blitzed Tom Brady often, both which resulted in Gronkowski having one of his lowest outputs of the year. The Broncos have another option in Danny Trevathan, who is a nimble linebacker that does well in coverage. Trevathan is 6’1” and 230 pounds, not tall enough to challenge Gronkowski for jump balls but physical enough the jam him at the line.</p>
<p>This is where the rash of injuries the Patriots have suffered come into play. Without Dion Lewis, Julian Edelman, or Danny Amendola the Patriots will have to rely heavily on Gronkowski and Brandon LaFell. If no other players step up and the Patriots fail to run the ball well, Denver will be able to divert extra resources, perhaps a mix of Talib and Trevathan, to stopping the Patriots All-Pro. Normally when articles are written about how a team can slow Gronkowski down, he answers them with monster performances. This week could be one of the few times were a team is expected to and actually does slow him down.</p>
<p>One thing that the Bills did an excellent job of against the Patriots was confusing the protection up front. They blitzed effectively but were also able to get pressure on Brady with less than five rushers because of how well they disguised what they were going to do. With a defensive coordinator who is as adept as Wade Phillips, the Broncos have a realistic chance of doing the same.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Miller is licking his chops after watching the Patriots offensive line struggle on Monday night. Miller is one of the most dynamic pass rushers in the NFL and he has been a key piece of the dominant Denver defense. The Broncos can line him up in several different spots but it is likely they will target Patriots offensive tackle Marcus Cannon. Cannon is a backup who has been pressed into service due to Nate Solder’s injury and his performance has been spotty. He played well against the Colts before being injured and missing several weeks. His first game back was Monday night and he played poorly. He accounted for two penalties and was beaten off the ball consistently. Against a player like Miller, the odds are heavily stacked against Cannon. Earlier this season when the Patriots went against strong pass rushes, they made a point of having Brady get rid of the ball in less than two and a half seconds therefore negating the rush. With Edelman, Amendola and Lewis out they will have a tougher time of doing that and more pressure is put on the offensive line.</p>
<p>Going against a prodigious pass rusher like Miller is not the only concern of Cannon’s. As the Patriots left tackle, he will need to block Miller to the outside on many of the inside runs that the Patriots deploy. Much is made of Miller as a quarterback attacker, but he also needs to be accounted for in the run game. New England will surely give Cannon help from a running back or tight end, but he will have several plays in which he needs to defeat Miller on his own. If he cannot do that, it will be a long night for the Patriots offense. If he can, the Patriots will have a better chance at attacking Denver’s excellent secondary.</p>
<p>In both of these match-ups, the early advantage has to go to Denver. Gronkowski might be the best tight end ever to play football, but even he will need players around him to elevate their game in order to attack an opponent as qualified as Denver. Miller is a potential Hall of Famer in his own right and going against a backup tackle is almost not fair. This is not a death sentence on the Patriots undefeated season. They can go to Denver and win, but they will need to have success in both of these matchups more than 50% of the time. This shapes up to be a rock fight type of game that will be physical and punishing. It may not be Brady-Manning, but it will be must see TV.</p>

For most of the night against the Ravens, their pass rush was non-existent and Joe Flacco had plenty of time to find open receivers. In the Colts Divisional Playoff win against Denver, one of the key stories was the amount of time Andrew Luck had in the pocket to throw and that when the rush did get to him, he was able to escape for the most part.</p>
<p>In their previous win over the Colts this season, the Patriots dominated time of possession and their pass rush was not as a big a factor because they scored 43 points and held the ball the majority of the game. Although that result could happen again, it is not guaranteed and the Patriots could find themselves in a close game needing defensive stops. If that becomes the case, the Patriots pass rush could be the deciding factor.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/01/15/patriots-pass-rush-faces-tough-task-with-luck/">Patriots Pass Rush Faces Tough Task with Luck</a> (413 words)</p>

There are a couple teams that they should root for, however. Photo courtesy post-gazzette.com." ></a><p>This weekend will present two wild card playoff games in the AFC. The Patriots will be awaiting their outcomes as the results will determine who they play in the divisional round. The third-seeded Steelers will play the sixth-seeded Ravens and the fourth-seeded Colts will host the fifth-seeded Bengals in win or go home Wild Card games.  Out of these four teams, the Patriots could not play the Steelers in the divisional round but could play any of the other three. They have yet to play the Steelers or Ravens this season but have beaten the Bengals and colds handily.</p>
<p>When it comes to who the Patriots should root for this weekend, there are a couple options. The first and most important thing to consider is who they will play. A secondary concern is which team will play Denver. If Denver plays a team that could beat them or at least give them a tough game, it could help the Patriots should they advance to the conference championship. Given these factors, the Patriots should be rooting for the Colts and Steelers this weekend.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/01/01/who-the-patriots-should-be-rooting-for-wild-card-weekend/">Who the Patriots Should be Rooting for Wild Card Weekend</a> (726 words)</p>

There are several factors to this, including improved offensive line play and the emergence of Brandon LaFell. One of the biggest factors has been the return of tight end Rob Gronkowski to dominant form. Gronkowski has reestablished himself as the league’s best tight end and one of its best overall weapons.</p>
<p>In the five games since the Kansas City loss the Patriots Tom Brady has averaged 320 yards per game and Gronkowski has averaged 103 yards per game. His lowest output in that span was 68 yards and he was the Patriots leading receiver in three of the five games. He has been a force in the middle of the field and uncoverable in the red zone, leading to his five touchdowns in that span. He forces the defense to commit their coverage to him and that has helped New England&#8217;s other receivers most notably LaFell, who has had a breakout five weeks as well. Only one team, Denver, has tried to jam him at the line this season and even that proved unsuccessful as Gronkowski cut through the Denver defense for yet another 100 yard game. His blocking ability throughout his career has been documented and although he hasn’t been as dominant in that part of his game this season, he is still a massive upgrade over the rest of the tight end depth chart in New England.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2014/11/04/the-gronk-effect-dominant-tight-end-play-has-helped-revitalize-the-new-engladn-offense/">The Gronk Effect: Dominant Tight End Play has Helped Revitalize the Patriots Offense</a> (365 words)</p>

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola)" ></a><p>This was the game everyone had marked on their calendars. There&#8217;s the obvious Tom Brady vs. Peyton Manning rivalry, but this was more than that. Sunday was a chance to show everyone how good the Patriots truly are, and they did not disappoint. While Tom Brady has put together an impressive five game stretch of 18 touchdowns with only one interception, it&#8217;s been the strong play of the defense that has been the difference. They forced two turnovers on Sunday while keeping the Broncos&#8217; trips to the endzone to a minimum. After the chaos in Kansas City, the Patriots have gone on a five game tear that sits them atop the AFC after nine weeks.</p>
<p>&#8211; It&#8217;s been said time after time that this is one of the most impressive defensive units in the past decade for the Patriots. Even without mainstays such as Jerod Mayo and Chandler Jones, they managed to keep Manning at bay. Yes Manning did throw for over 400 yards, but he struggled to finish drives. The first interception was good a disguise by Rob Ninkovich to drop to the outside only to come back and cover the inside for the pick. Brandon Browner&#8217;s interception came courtesy of a tipped pass off of Wes Welker, who was leveled on the play and didn&#8217;t return to the game. The defensive scheme was similar to what the Jets did a few weeks back. They rushed three or four while utilizing a lot of man coverage. They started the game in the nickel formation and used five to six defensive backs for the majority. Unlike years past, they have the talent in the secondary to cover man-to-man on a consistent basis.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2014/11/03/notes-and-observations-week-9-patriots-make-a-statement-in-dominant-43-21-win-over-broncos/">Notes and Observations, Week 9: Patriots Make a Statement in Dominant 43-21 Win Over Broncos</a> (1,408 words)</p>

They set records last year and have picked up right where they left off ranking first in points per game, tied for first in touchdowns scored, third in passing yards, and sixth in total yards. It is a well-oiled machine with Peyton Manning deciding which part of the defense to dissect on any given play. Demaryius Thomas and Julius Thomas are dominant game changers to go along with Wes Welker and Emmanuel Sanders in the passing game. Emerging star Ronnie Hillman will anchor a running game that is effective when called upon. </p>
