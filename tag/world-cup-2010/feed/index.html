Before qualifying for the 1990 World Cup in Italy, the U.S. hadn&#8217;t played in a World Cup since 1950 when they handed Great Britain an epic 1-0 defeat but still failed to advance past the first round. So what happened? How could a nation with an embarrassment of riches &#8211; in terms of resources &#8211; be so woefully inept when it came to the world game?</p>
<h2>In the Beginning</h2>
<p>During the 1930 World Cup in Uruguay, the U.S. was a force to be reckoned with. They beat Belguim 3-0, Paraguay 3-0, before finally losing to Argentina 6-1 in the semi-finals. This still stands as the team&#8217;s highest finish as well as the highest finish of any team outside of CONMEBOL and UEFA, the South American and European confederations. Not a bad start for their first go-round in the World Cup. Sadly, that was by far the best they were ever going to do. America was bounced in the first round in 1934 in Italy, didn&#8217;t qualify for the France games in 1938, and really didn&#8217;t experience any other success on the international stage until that victory over England in 1950.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/06/11/the-u-s-a-and-the-world-cup-a-history/">The U.S.A. and The World Cup: A History</a> (1,198 words)</p>
