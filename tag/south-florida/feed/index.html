(Scott Threlkeld/The Times-Picayune)" ></a><p>1. <strong>Oklahoma</strong> (32)<br />
The Sooners opened with a convincing win. It was nothing spectacular, but they didn’t have anything to fear from Tulsa. They just went about their business, and now they can prepare for the huge matchup with Florida State next week.</p>
<p>2. <strong>LSU</strong> (17)<br />
After winning the opening weekend’s marquee matchup, it’s tough to deny that LSU deserves to be the No. 2 in the country. With another tough non-conference matchup with No. 19 West Virginia in a few weeks, they already control their own destiny. If they win out, they are almost guaranteed to make the BCS Championship. Relying on Les Miles to guide his team through an entire season unscathed is a precarious proposition, but at least the team has started out strong.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Alabama</strong> (9)<br />
LSU played Oregon while Alabama played Kent State. No Crimson Tide fan should be upset about being leapfrogged by LSU. There’s no strong argument against it. Even if there was, these two teams play each other, so it doesn’t really matter. That’s down the road though, and Alabama goes to No. 23 Penn State this week. It will be a great game, and it should be played in black and white.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Boise State</strong> (2)<br />
America’s Team continued its “We Belong” tour this week with a sound drubbing of the Georgia Bulldogs, whose uniforms were sponsored by Satan. More importantly, Boise State’s BCS Championship hopes were dealt a blow when TCU lost to Baylor, thus weakening Boise State’s strength of schedule and potentially robbing them of a second marquee win down the line. If you have any doubts about how convoluted the BCS is, know that Boise State went into a hostile SEC dome in what was essentially a true road game, drubbed a ranked SEC team, and still had to worry that they might fall short this season because of a game in Waco the night before.</p>
