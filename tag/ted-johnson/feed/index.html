				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A short time ago, Herschel Walker admitted to the public that he dealt with Dissociative Identity Disorder. It was so bad that he even played Russian roulette at one point, and luckily came out alive. In 2002 he was diagnosed with the disorder and began treatment and eventually conquered it, but not after having lost his wife. He&#8217;s not alone, though, when it comes to famous athletes with disorders. Ted Johnson suffered from depression after post-concussion syndrome. Zack Greinke suffered from social anxiety disorder. Barret Robbins had Bipolar disorder. And that&#8217;s just the beginning of the list.</p>
<p>For the most part, as fans, we look at athletes based on their physical stature and the numbers that they produce while playing. We cheer them on when they do well and sometimes boo them when they don&#8217;t perform well. We may taunt them or make up some catchphrase involving their name or nickname. However, what we forget is that there is more to an athlete than just that. After all, an athlete is just doing their job, and they too are just trying to make a living, and their profession just happens to be what they do well. They too must deal with the same issues many of us deal with.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Patriots linebacker Ted Johnson has added a new twist to the Spygate story. Johnson told USA Today in 2005 that from time to time he would receive the opposing offense&#8217;s audibles on a sheet of paper an hour before a game and didn&#8217;t know where they came from.</p>
<p>Johnson was just interviewed on Sportscenter and said he does <strong>not</strong> want to make it sound as though he thinks the Patriots spied to receive the audibles. He was asked if he ever saw any videotapes of opposing coaches and responded, &#8220;Absolutely not. Never.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnson said he was just as surprised as anyone to hear the allegations of cheating. Also he said while he was a little suspicious on how the coaches received the audibles, there could be many explanations beyond illegally videotaping.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once the spit is flying out there on the field, I&#8217;m not thinking too much about audibles,&#8221; Johnson said.</p>
<p><strong>My Take:</strong> When I first heard the story it certainly made me sit up in my chair. But after hearing Johnson&#8217;s explanation on Sportscenter, it doesn&#8217;t seem as though this could affect the investigation as a whole.</p>
