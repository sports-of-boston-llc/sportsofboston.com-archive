The powerhouse hitting Red Sox are now in a position where the postseason is not a guarantee. They have been bouncing in and out of first, second, and third place for a majority of the season. The Red Sox, Blue Jays and Orioles have been the most dominant teams in the Al East all season.</p>
<p>Going into Monday Aug. 29th, the Red Sox sit in second place with a 72-58 record, two games behind the Blue Jays. Baltimore sits right behind the Sox, only one game back. So the question we are all wondering is who is going to win the division?</p>
<p>I believe at this point it&#8217;s a complete toss up. We can pull out as many statistics as we want to predict the end of the season results but we have to remember that this is baseball. This game is so unpredictable, especially when there are only 30 games left to be played. Any team could take the division with being just a half game up, it could be that close.</p>
<p>The good news is that the next month of baseball is going to be tough for all teams in the AL East. Starting tonight until the end of the season the Sox have two remaining series against the Rays, Yankees, Orioles, and the Blue Jays. So the standings in the AL East are going to be jumping all around for the next month. If the Sox want a legitimate chance at taking the division, they need to be the best team in the month of September, period.</p>
<p>If the Sox do not win the division, they always have the Wild Card. But with the Wild Card , the top two teams have to play in a one game playoff match up to decide who moves onto the ALDS. Boston needs to avoid this at all costs because a one game deciding match up is a tough game to win. If this were to happen I&#8217;d be scared to see who Farrell decides to start on the bump.</p>
<p>However I am very confident the Sox will finish the season strong. Their hitting is still very dominant. Ortiz is still showing he&#8217;s one of the best with 30 plus homers and 100 plus RBIs. Mookie is still one of the best hitters in the entire MLB right now with 29 homers, 94 RBIs, and a .321 AVG (Did I mention he was a lead off hitter for the majority of the season?). And Pedey quietly is hitting .320 going into Monday. So the bats are there. Again as we&#8217;ve discussed a million times, it all comes down to the Sox pitching. Starting pitching for Boston has looked better lately, the bullpen is still an issue. All we can do at this point is pray that the pitching comes around going into September.</p>
<p>The toughest series the Sox are going to have this next month are the ones against the Blue Jays. Toronto plays as the biggest threat towards Boston. They are a very well rounded team that can hit and have some pitching. The two series the Sox have against them in the next month are definitely the most imports series they will have all year.</p>
<p>This all being said, I&#8217;m super excited for the next month of baseball because its going to be a a fun one to watch.</p>

Mostly, I felt for the Sox themselves and how they must have been feeling. As daunting as it seemed, the forecast only got worse as the Red Sox had to play a one o&#8217; clock game in Detroit after a night game in Baltimore, leaving the Sox with four cities in six days.</p>
<p>The sweep preceding this awful road trip was a good morale boost for the streaky Sox, who were not having a great month up to that point. When the Diamondbacks came to town, I believed the Sox would take two out of three, but they played great and swept Arizona out of the stadium. The next night, in Cleveland, Drew Pomeranz (finally) pitched a gem, and gave the Red Sox their fourth win in a row, and his first in a Boston uniform. All was well so far, but the next two nights, the Orioles loomed large.</p>

<p>Over this road trip, The Sox starters have a combined ERA of 1.51.  It doesn&#8217;t matter who&#8217;s on the mound right now, from Price, Porcello, Pomeranz, and even Clay Buchholz, they are all producing.  Most impressive all the starters are able lately to go deeper in the game, which really helps with a bullpen as putrid as The Sox pen.  With these being the dog days of summer and another long road trip on the horizon, The starters have to continue to dominate the way they have been.</p>
<p>The offense hasn&#8217;t been too shabby over this stretch.  Betts and Ortiz have been hot of late, and with constant contributing from Sandy Leon, Dustin Pedroia, and Hanley Ramirez this offense isn&#8217;t showing any signs of slowing up.  It would be nice to see Xander get going, his last two games he has had two hit in each game, which is a good sign.  As well as the starters have been pitching they could go south very fast, and if or when that happens it will be up to the offense to carry the load.</p>

This was their 6th straight win and they have now moved into the top spot in the wildcard. They are now only one game behind Toronto for first place in the division. One of the many reasons the Sox are playing so well is star outfielder, Mookie Betts.  Betts is playing unbelievable right now and definitely should be in discussion for MVP right now. Since August, he has batted .403, with seven homeruns and 20 RBI’s. He had a three home-run game against Arizona on the 14th and a two home-run game against the Orioles on the 16th. The three home-run game was Bett’s second time doing that this season and the first time a Red Sox player has done that since the great Ted Williams. I know that Jose Altuve is having an amazing year, batting .364 for the Astros, but if the Sox make the playoffs and the Astro’s don’t than Betts should hands down get the MVP.</p>
<p>The Red Sox starting pitching has also been a big factor why they have won 6th straight games. In the past seven days the Sox starting pitching has only let up a total of eleven runs. Rick Porcello picked up his 16th win on Sunday, and all season long has given the Sox a pitcher they can rely on. If Porcello keeps pitching as well as he has, he will definitely be in the discussion for Cy young. Rodriguez has also been a nice surprise lately. In the month of August he has an ERA of 2.08. It really seems like he is turning around his season. Unfortunately, on Tuesday, while pitching a no hitter through four innings he had to come out of the game due to injury. Hopefully, this is just something minor and continues to pitch well for the rest of the season.</p>
<p>The Sox have 43 games left and a three game lead in the Wild card standings so as of right now they are in a good position to make the playoffs. I believe that they will and if they don’t I will consider this season a disappointment. Go sox!</p>

Mookie tour up July, posting some pretty impressive stats. He batted .368, hit five home runs, had 15 RBIs, five stolen bases and had a 1.068 OPS.</p>
<p>At just 23 years of age Betts is having himself a remarkable season. He is arguably the best lead-off hitter in the MLB as he is is in first place in multiple lead-off hitter statistic categories including hits, home runs, RBIs, and doubles.</p>
<p>Mookie currently has 140 hits (31 doubles), 22 home runs, 71 RBIs, and an average of .306. He joins teammate Jackie Bradley Jr. as the only Red Sox players this year to receive player of the month rewards; JBJ won AL player of the month back in May.</p>
<p>Betts keeps proving to everybody that he is becoming an elite out fielder/hitter in this league and I believe he can easily be compared to a Mike Trout caliber player. Hey if you don&#8217;t agree with me, the stats speak for themselves.</p>

Two Red Sox players are considered to be serious contenders in this year&#8217;s insanely competitive AL MVP race. Those two players are Xander Bogaerts and David Ortiz. However there are many other great players to consider when talking about the MVP race.</p>
<h2>Potential AL MVP Candidates</h2>
<ul>
<li>Josh Donaldson</li>
<li>Jose Altuve</li>
<li>Robinson Cano</li>
<li>Mike Trout</li>
<li>Manny Machado</li>
</ul>
<p>Many people put Josh Donaldson at the top of the list right now. Donaldson was the AL MVP last season and is once again having himself a fantastic season. But I personally wouldn&#8217;t put him at the top of the list right now. If I had to choose a player right now to be at the top of the AL MVP race I would choose Astros 2B Jose Altuve. Altuve currently leads to MLB with 135 hits and a .358 AVG. Right behind Altuve I would put Ortiz. Ortiz leads the MLB with 34 doubles, a SLG of .665, and an OPS of 1.083.</p>
<p>The only problem with Ortiz is that he&#8217;s a DH. Many people use that against him because there are no defensive stats to credit him with. But with the performance David is having at the plate this year makes him a serious contender for the MVP award in his final season.</p>
<p>Do not forget about Xander Bogaerts. He is being viewed as a genuine player to win the award. He is arguably one of the best hitting shortstops in the entire MLB. As of Saturday Xander has 125 hits (3rd in the MLB behind Jose Altuve and Mookie Betts), 23 doubles, 11 home runs, 61 RBIs, .324 AVG, .381 OBP, .469 SLG, and a .850 OPS. Xander is also a very good defensive player with a .973 fielding percentage and only 9 errors in 813 innings.</p>
<p>The AL MVP race is going to be a very competitive one this year because there are so may players that could take the crown. But it is only half way through the season so nobody knows who&#8217;s going to stay on track or drop off the candidate list. All I&#8217;m saying is to not count the Sox sluggers out of the race, especially Ortiz. Even though he&#8217;s a DH, he&#8217;s putting up one of the best seasons of his career and has some of the best numbers in the game right now.</p>
<p>Can you imagine a 40 year old in his last season winning an MVP award? We can only hope&#8230;</p>

Xander Bogaerts, David Ortiz, Mookie Betts, and Jackie Bradley Jr. all seem destined to have the highest vote-count at their respective positions, and the fans will likely see more Sox on the field in the first inning than any other team.</p>
<p>The final rosters for the ASG will be revealed at 7 pm on ESPN. Expect Boston to once again have a strong presence in the making of the AL team.</p>

<p>Rick Porcello pitched what I think was his best game of the season on saturday night, heck it might have been the best game he has pitched in his short Red Sox career. He had good movement on all of his pitches, and continuously got guys to hit weak fly balls.  Porcello really stopped the bleeding, yes he gave up 2 runs in the first 2 innings, however 2 runs is a good number to give up with this Red Sox offense.  It was really Porcello and the killer B&#8217;s (Betts,Bogaerts,Bradley) that won saturdays game for The Sox.</p>
<p>David Price was DOMINANT today, only gave up 1 run and pitched into the 8th inning for his third straight game.  I was iffy on Price towards the beginning of the season, but right now he is locked in.  However as dominant as Price has been lately, he hasn&#8217;t got much run support.  Today was also a tough day for the offense, until the bottom of the seventh when Mookie homered over the monster.  I really don&#8217;t understand why opposing pitchers try to sneak inside fastballs past Mookie.</p>
<p>Today was a big series win for The Sox, however for it to be a successful homestand they need to win the series against the White Sox.</p>

Jackie sits comfortably in the number three spot (over 937,000 votes) right behind Mike Trout and Lorenzo Cain. He is expected to be a starter in the All-Star game. Meanwhile Ortiz and Bogaerts both lead the AL with votes in their positions. But these are not the only three Sox players that may make the All-Star game this July.</p>
<h2>Potential Sox Players to Make ASG:</h2>
<ul>
<li>DH David Ortiz</li>
<li>SS Xander Bogaerts</li>
<li>OF Jackie Bradley Jr.</li>
<li>OF Mookie Betts</li>
<li>2B Dustin Pedroia</li>
<li>1B Hanley Ramirez</li>
<li>3B Travis Shaw</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sox have a chance a pretty good chance to bring a decent amount of players to the All-Star game, but it shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise to anyone. The Red Sox are the best hitting team in the MLB. They are first in runs (342), hits (610), doubles (152), total bases (1015), RBIs (329), AVG. (.290), OBP (.355), SLG (.482), and OPS (.837). They lead in almost every major offensive statistic so it wouldn&#8217;t be a shocker if half of the starting lineup ends up All-Stars this season. At one point during the season, six of the nine starting players were batting over .300 which is ridiculous. These guys are proving that they are a dominant force on the offensive side and they are really trying to make a name for themselves this year.</p>
<p>Now their pitching is another story. Everyone knows that Boston&#8217;s weakest part of their game is their pitching. But they do have some solid pitching from David Price, Rick Porcello, and Stephen Wright. If any pitchers from the Sox were going to make the All-Star game, I would have to say it would only be Porcello. He is 7-2 on the season with a 4.04 ERA. But I honestly don&#8217;t think Porcello will make it. If he had another win or two and had a lower ERA then yes he probably would make the team.</p>
<p>This time of year is looking very different from where the Sox were last year. The only player from Boston to make the All-Star game was Brock Holt. Now Holt has been hurt for a while with a concussion so we haven&#8217;t seen him so he&#8217;s out of the question for this year&#8217;s game. But to go from one All-Star to potentially four, five, maybe even six All-Stars in one year is a huge improvement.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how the voting ballots end up and who leads in each category. I want to see our players at the top of the food chain come July. But its up to <strong>YOU</strong> Boston fans to cast your vote and get our boys to the All-Star game. So head on over to MLB.com and vote! You can vote a total of 35 times total and five times a day. If I could vote 35 times a day I would but I also have no life so that&#8217;s just me.</p>
<p>Happy Voting</p>

Betts is the first player in franchise history to hit three home runs out of the leadoff spot (Elias Sports Bureau), and now has twelve on the season, second behind David Ortiz (14).</p>
<p>With two outs in the second inning, after two straight walks by Baltimore pitcher Kevin Gausman, Mookie socked a 95 mph fastball to left. The ball barely cleared the 333&#8242; marker, and the shot put the Red Sox up for good. Betts would add a solo shot to right in the 7th that served as an insurance run, and the Red Sox would go on to win, 6-2.</p>
<p>Betts attributed his power to his quick hands, and Ortiz agreed, saying &#8220;He&#8217;s got great hands. He knows about the strike zone really well. He knows the minute that he gets out of it, like we always talk, he can get in trouble. He&#8217;s so young, man. It&#8217;s so impressive how he handles his business.&#8221; (ESPN)</p>
<p>Betts and the Red Sox will go for three straight wins in Baltimore tonight at 7:05.</p>
