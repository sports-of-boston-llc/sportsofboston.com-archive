				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The AFC Championship promises to be a great game. After defeating Kansas City and Pittsburgh, respectively, the New England Patriots will travel to Denver to play the Broncos on Sunday for a trip to Santa Clara. The main storyline will be the 17th matchup between future Hall of Famers Tom Brady and Peyton Manning, the fourth time it has come in the AFC Championship.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Tom Brady looked much like he had during the first 10 games of the season. With Julian Edelman back and Rob Gronkowski having a full workload, Brady was able to get rid of the ball quickly and move the Patriots down the field. Edelman was not available the first time the Patriots played the Broncos this season and the team struggled at times to move the ball against a great defense. With him back, the Patriots will be able to put up points much easier.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, Manning didn’t play terrible, but he did not look like a quarterback capable of winning this week. He threw for 222 yards, but the Denver offense was quiet for most of the game and if not for a key fumble by Fitz Toussaint in the fourth quarter, they might have lost.</p>
<p>In order to win this week, the Broncos cannot rely on Manning. They will need big games out of Ronnie Hillman and C.J. Anderson at running back. In order to counter this, the Patriots front seven will need to match the Denver running backs in the running and passing game. The Patriots’ ability to do this will come down to two players up front, Jamie Collins and Dont’a Hightower. This is significant because the first time these two teams matched up Collins did not play and Hightower left early with an injury.</p>
<p>They were both on the field for most of the Divisional Round game. The Chiefs had 135 yards rushing, but 44 of those were on Alex Smith scrambles or designed runs. The Kansas City running backs combined for 28 yards receiving as well, putting their overall yardage output at 119. If the Patriots can hold the Denver backs to that number, it is unlikely the Denver offense will be able to put up more points than the Patriots.</p>
<p>Against the Steelers, Hillman or Anderson carried the ball on 31 of 70 offensive snaps and were also targeted four times in the passing game. Together, that is 50 percent of the offensive snaps that running backs were the focus. Denver didn’t show much ability to get the ball downfield outside of one catch by Emmanuel Sanders that went for 34 yards and one catch by Bennie Fowler that went for 31 yards. However, both of those passes traveled fewer than 20 yards from the line of scrimmage.</p>
<p>This is where Collins and Hightower come into play. The Patriots love to use both of them to blitz the A gap (between the center and the guard) to either create pressure up the middle or blow up run plays. Hightower can also cover well and Collins is an excellent coverage linebacker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Collins and Hightower will need to makes plays in order to contain the Denver running backs. It almost sounds blasphemous to suggest that a team should force Manning to beat them, but that’s what this season has come down to. The more the Patriots can make Manning throw the ball downfield from the pocket the better. Eliminating the run game and his safety valves in the passing game will make it difficult for Denver to keep pace with New England.</p>
<p>Despite having an excellent defense, the Broncos are still going to need to put up points. If Collins and Hightower play well throughout the game, the Broncos won’t have enough juice to reach Super Bowl 50.</p>

The Chiefs were dominant on defense and forced a shaky Houston offense into a borderline embarrassing performance. Kansas City was able to get after Houston quarterback Brian Hoyer forcing a fumble and four interceptions. Despite the pressure put on by the Chiefs defensive line Hoyer was also his own worst enemy making terrible decisions, particularly in the red zone. Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith and the KC offense was efficient against a tough Houston defensive that held them to just six points in the first half however they led 13-0 at the break thanks to a 106-yard kickoff returned for a touchdown by Knile Davis to start the game. In the second half the Chiefs were able to open up the lead as Hoyer and the Texans continued to shoot themselves in the foot. Kansas City, playing on the road, was not phased by the 71,000 screaming  fans or defensive stud J.J. Watt who they avoided with quick hitting pass plays, screens, sweeps and extra manpower. Alex Smith finished the day 17 of 22 for 190 yards with a touchdown and a rare interception, coach Andy Reid&#8217;s experience and game plan worked perfectly. Kansas City is now riding an 11-game win streak coming into Foxborough for next week&#8217;s divisional round playoff match up and should be as confident as ever.</p>
<p>One key problem for the Chiefs is the status of star receiver Jeremy Macklin who has been a go to guy for Alex Smith all season. Macklin suffered and injury to his ACL late in the second half of the win in Houston and did not return. He is due to have an MRI today to assess the extent of the damage, KC fans will be crossing their fingers in hopes that Macklin does not have a tear in that right knee. Maclin caught 87 passes for 1,088 yards and eight touchdowns during the regular season. Also banged up coming into the game against the Patriots will be Tamba Hali with a thumb and knee injury who had limited action against the Texans but is a key figure in the pass rush for KC that will be essential to getting pressure on Tom Brady, the formula for disrupting the flow of the Patriots offense. Linebacker Justin Houston also seemed to tweak his knee which has been a lingering injury for him this season causing him to miss five games.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2016/01/10/pats-draw-streaking-chiefs-for-divisional-round-playoff/">Pats Draw Streaking Chiefs For Divisional Round Playoff</a> (519 words)</p>

Adding Jackson to the 53-man roster put the Patriots at a total of 75 different players making up the 53-man roster over the course of this season. The injuries have been noticeable and if this were any other team they would have been crippled. Instead Bill Belichick and Tom Brady have steered the ship to another first round playoff bye and with another win can lock up home field advantage throughout the playoffs. Injuries are part of the game but it&#8217;s obvious that no one handles them better than the New England Patriots.</p>
<p>&#8211; Joey Iosefa is the exact reason Patriots fans only wonder one thing every year which is &#8220;are they going to have the first or second seed?&#8221; LeGarrette Blount was finally getting the late season production that he has been so good at. Just as he&#8217;s getting the carries he goes down for the year with a hip injury. The expectation was James White and Brandon Bolden would see an increased role, which they both did. In classic Belichick fashion he promoted Iosefa from he practice squad on Saturday night. Iosefa then carried the ball 14 times for 51 hard earned yards, while also blocking as a full back. Sure it wasn&#8217;t a Jonas Gray 200-yard game but Belichick once again found production where you&#8217;d least expect it. The addition of Steven Jackson adds depth and experience, not to mention he has fresh legs. For how the Patriots use the running game they definitely have the pieces in place for a postseason push.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/12/21/notes-and-observations-week-15-patriots-clinch-1st-round-bye-handling-the-titans-33-16/">Notes and Observations Week 15: Patriots Clinch 1st Round Bye Handling the Titans 33-16</a> (1,430 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Patriots, who have suffered several key injuries over the past month, are likely going to welcome some reinforcements back today. Both wide receiver Danny Amendola and linebacker Jamie Collins are both expected back today, providing a boost to their respective units.</p>
<p>Collins came down with an illness before the team&#8217;s game against the Redskins and has been out since then. Amendola sustained a leg injury in the Monday night game against Buffalo two weeks ago and missed last week&#8217;s trip to Denver.</p>
<p>The timing of the returns is fortuitous for New England. Dont&#8217;a Hightower is suffered a leg injury against Denver and is questionable to today&#8217;s game. With him out, the return of Collins is all the more important for the Patriots. The Patriots offense will be without Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski today and for the next several weeks so the return of Amendola provides the Patriots with a trusted option in the passing game.</p>

(AP Photo/Joe Mahoney)" ></a><p>Now that we&#8217;ve all had a full 24 hours to digest the frustrating monstrosity that was Sunday Night Football, we can rationally examine the remains. While it was fun to imagine this team really sticking it to the whole league and going 16-0 everyone knew just how hard that task would be. Every team in the league has to deal with injuries and atrocious officiating every single week, but Sunday night was the culmination of a season of that frustration for the previously undefeated Patriots. After losing key offensive weapons three consecutive weeks in Dion Lewis, Julian Edelman, and Danny Amendola, they narrowly escaped another major knee injury to Rob Gronkowski. The NFL referees have been astonishingly awful all season for every team but they really showed up to play for prime time. Unfortunately they were playing for the Broncos.</p>
<p>&#8211; It&#8217;s easy to write me off as biased and a homer for claiming the refs weren&#8217;t doing the Patriots any favors. However all it takes is a small semblance of a brain to realize the penalties called late in the game were a huge reason Sunday went the way it did. With just under 12 minutes to go in the third quarter and the Patriots up 21-14 Brady hit KeShawn Martin with a 51-yard bomb that was called back for holding on Tre Jackson. With just under five minutes to go in the game Brady hit Gronk on 3rd-and-5 for a 10-yard completion which was of course called back on Gronk&#8217;s fifth offensive pass interference call of the season. The holding on Jackson was borderline and the defender initiated the contact with Gronk, who never even extended his arm. (...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/12/01/notes-and-observations-week-12-patriots-lose-1st-game-in-frustrating-fashion-broncos-win-in-ot-30-24/">Notes and Observations Week 12: Patriots Lose 1st Game in Frustrating Fashion; Broncos Win in OT 30-24</a> (1,139 words)</p>

The injury happened in the first half and Hightower went back to the locker room before halftime. He watched the second half from the sidelines.</p>
<p>A sprained MCL will typically keep a player out a few weeks, but this can vary depending on the severity of the sprain and how much pain it causes to the player. Any absence for Hightower is a blow to the Patriots defense that is still currently without Jamie Collins, although he could come back this week. After Hightower left Sunday night&#8217;s game, the Broncos rushed for 136 yards and three touchdowns.</p>
<p>A first round pick in 2012, Hightower has established himself over the past two seasons as one of the best players on the Patriots defense and has been part of a front seven unit this season that has been dominating. The most important issue for the Patriots on defense is having both Hightower and Collins healthy for the playoffs, which looks like it will be the case.</p>

<p>Now that the undefeated season has been undone, the comparisons to the 2007 Patriots can be put to bed, and the world can finally see this Patriots team for what it truly is: a flawed squad whose Super Bowl aspirations may have finally come back to reality thanks to a seemingly insurmountable rash of injuries.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/11/30/undefeated-mirage-gives-way-to-reality-of-flawed-patriots-team-in-ot-loss-to-broncos/">Undefeated Mirage Gives Way to Reality of Flawed Patriots Team in OT Loss to Broncos</a> (721 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Rob Gronkowski was down on the field writing in pain in the fourth quarter of last night&#8217;s game, things appeared to be dire for New England. Gronkowski is as important to the Patriots offense as Tom Brady is, far and away the best tight end in the league. If he was going to miss significant time, the Patriots Super Bowl aspirations would have been thrown in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Thankfully for the Patriots, it appears as though the injury is not as bad as originally thought. His x-rays came back negative and the team had a positive outlook  towards his MRI today. One source even told Ian Rapoport of NFL Network that Gronkowski may not even miss a game. For a team that has suffered a rash of injuries to key offensive players, this good news surely comes with an enormous sigh of relief.</p>
<p>The Patriots did not escape Denver completely unscathed, however. Star linebacker Dont&#8217;a Hightower suffered an MCL sprain in the loss and could miss several weeks. Depending on how bad the sprain is, he could come back sooner but with Jamie Collins still out the Patriots are thin at linebacker to go along with already being thin at wide receiver.</p>
<p>If Gronkowski has to miss a week, he will not be on the field for next Sunday&#8217;s game against Philadelphia. The team could choose to sit him out as a precaution and still win, which would be an ideal situation. After the game against Philadelphia, the Patriots travel to Houston for Sunday Night Football.</p>

With the offense devastated by injuries, the defense played some of its best football of the season. The offense is clearly dealing with communication and trust issues with all the new pieces being plugged in along the way. For the first time in weeks the offensive line was healthy but ironically it was the worst they&#8217;ve looked all year. Tom Brady&#8217;s most reliable receiver with zero dropped passes, Danny Amendola, left with an apparent knee injury. After his exit they had three healthy receivers. One was Matthew Slater and another was Chris Harper who has never caught an NFL pass. With all that they still made the plays to win a divisional game in prime time.</p>
<p>&#8211; Aside from a few big plays the defense showed again how good they can be. The front seven was holding contain on Tyrod Taylor for the majority of the game. Pressure caused by the pass rush directly led to multiple poorly thrown passes. LeSean McCoy did break the 27-yard touchdown run but was held to just 55 rushing yards other than that. By his standards that&#8217;s a relatively calm day. Rob Ninkovich continued his solid campaign by adding another 1.5 sacks and pressuring Taylor throughout. Rotating defensive linemen throughout the game has paid off for the Patriots as each group knows exactly what their job is, and they&#8217;re doing it well.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/11/25/notes-and-observations-week-11-defense-leads-battered-patriots-to-victory-over-bills-20-13/">Notes and Observations Week 11: Defense Leads Battered Patriots to Victory Over Bills 20-13</a> (978 words)</p>
