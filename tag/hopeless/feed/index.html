<p>The past several days have really been a textbook lesson in the mourning process, as I went through all the standard Kubler-Ross stages of grief.</p>
<p>First there was denial: “I must be having an acid flashback, because there’s no way in hell I just saw the Bruins blow a 3 goal lead to lose Game 7 after being up 3-0 in the series.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, anger. “Goddammit! Do you guys not know how to perform a line change? The Mighty Ducks managed it throughout three goddamn movies and they were a ragtag bunch of misfits that were coached by a dude with a couple DUI’s in his past. How f’ing dumb are you?!”</p>
<p>There was bargaining. “OK, I promise I’ll withdraw that anonymous tip that Dan Carcillo was riding around in a sketchy van and offering free candy to kids if you let this series go 9 games.”</p>
<p>Next came depression. “I’m going to drink all 21 of those Miller Lites in the fridge. But only after I take down this Old English 40. Does anyone have a razor blade handy by the way?”</p>
<p>Finally, there was acceptance. “Forget it. I knew this was going to happen. I knew this was just too good to be true. They’re never going to get over that hump.”(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/05/21/the-boston-bruins-taking-the-place-of-the-pre-2004-red-sox/">The Boston Bruins: Taking the Place of the Pre-2004 Red Sox</a> (627 words)</p>
