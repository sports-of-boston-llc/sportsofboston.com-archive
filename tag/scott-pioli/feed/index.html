<p>Pioli was in the Patriots organization from 2000 to 2008, originally as Assistant Director of Player Personnel, but was promoted after one season to Director of Player Personnel.</p>
<p>Pioli had a lot of work to do to right the struggling Chiefs franchise, owners of a 2-14 record during the 2008 campaign. His first move was to fire head coach Herm Edwards and replace him with Arizona Cardinals offensive coordinator Todd Haley.</p>

<p>None of us had any hard feelings about Charlie Weis or Romeo Crennel leaving the team amidst a dynasty.  They had both gone on to better individual positions and they had earned it.  They each left gracefully and handled their own business.  And when Scott Pioli and Josh McDaniels left, we sent them off with parting gifts Mike Vrabel, Matt Cassell and Daniel Graham.</p>
<p>Mangini had a chance to do the same.  He made it difficult, by taking a head coach job with the easily hate-able New York Jets.  But if he had done it respectfully, the rivalry would have been more of a mutual respect between the two, similar to the rivalry between Belichick and Tony Dungy during Dungy&#8217;s run with the Colts.  But the bad blood between the two couldn’t be held back after a famous accusation in 2007.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/07/07/eric-mangini-wants-to-be-friends-with-bill-belichick-again/">Eric Mangini Wants to be Friends with Bill Belichick Again</a> (374 words)</p>

He is now adding former New Englanders to his coaching stable with this week&#8217;s acquisitions of Offensive Coordinator Charlie Weis and Defensive Coordinator Romeo Crennel. Weis and Crennel held the same positions in New England during the Super Bowl era of 2001 through 2004. Each departed their position after the 2004 season and the Super Bowl wins. Weis left for the head coaching job at Notre Dame; Crennel took over as Cleveland&#8217;s head coach. Does Todd Haley have reason to worry that Pioli is looking to replace him with Bill Belichick to complete the puzzle on the coaching staff?</p>
<p>Crennel lasted four seasons in Cleveland, never making the playoffs and recording only one winning season. He was replaced by Eric Mangini, who replaced him as the Patriots defensive coordinator. Mangini just completed his first season which began ugly, but finished with a four game winning streak, likely saving his job with new boss Mike Holmgren in town. Weis was just fired from Notre Dame after five seasons at 35-27. He made only two BCS bowls, and three overall, and Notre Dame finished above .500 only three times. The Irish&#8217; high-priced gamble on a pro-style coach with winning credentials did not correlate to a college campus. He seemed to have difficulty recruiting and motivating players, translating to difficulties on the field.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/01/13/chiefs-attempting-to-rebuild-patriots-dynasty/">Chiefs Attempting to Rebuild Patriots Dynasty?</a> (413 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Denver Broncos and Kansas Chiefs recently acquired former Patriots personnel to help revive both AFC West teams. The Broncos picked up Josh McDaniels as head coach, and players Jabar Gaffney and LaMont Jordan. The Chiefs picked up Matt Cassel and Mike Vrabel, as well as Scott Pioli as the new general manager. Many are wondering, who will have the most successful season?</p>
<p>McDaniels’ eight-year career with the Patriots gives him the proper knowledge and tools necessary to strengthen the Broncos. He first worked as a personnel assistant in the scouting department, having little influence. In 2005, the Pats were number two in the NFL in offensive passing while McDaniels was quarterback coach. He then took over as offensive coordinator, placing him in a position of power. During this period he worked with Gaffney, a wide receiver, and Jordan, a running back. McDaniels had one of the most productive offenses in NFL history during the 2007 season where Gaffney and others helped the Patriots achieve 75 touchdowns and 589 points. Although Jordan only played in eight games in 2008, he had 80 rushes for 363 yards with four touchdowns. Both Gaffney and Jordan know what McDaniels expects from them on the field and carry this knowledge with them to Denver. The Chiefs are also welcoming their new additions.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know what you are thinking. A starting quarterback and our defensive leader for a measly second round pick? Isn&#8217;t Matt Cassel less of a risk to a bad team than taking an unproven starter in the first round? What is Bill Belichick thinking turning down a top 15 pick from Denver and instead making a deal with an old pal?</p>
<p>Fair questions sure enough. Instead of taking a Madden &#8217;09 GM approach to the Patriots-Chiefs trade earlier this week and looking at what could have been in hindsight, it&#8217;s important to look broadly at the move. The Patriots made the best deal that made the most financial sense at the time it was offered.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s offical. Another big branch from the Bill Belichick tree has been cut down. The Kansas City <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3830515">Chiefs have hired Patriots VP of Player Personnel Scott Pioli to run their football operations</a> in Kansas City. The hiring of Pioli likely means that head coach Herm Edwards will likely be fired as a new administration will begin to take shape.</p>
<p>The 43-year-old Pioli has been with the team for nine seasons and has won two Sporting News Executive of the Year awards. Pioli, along with Bill Belichick, has been behind some incredible moves, like the sixth-round draft choice of Tom Brady, the seventh-round draft choice of Matt Cassel, and the trade for WR Randy Moss (for a fourth-round selection).</p>
<p>Patriots personnel director Nick Caserio will take Pioli&#8217;s old job with the Patriots.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/01/14/chiefs-hire-scott-pioli-as-new-gm/">Chiefs Hire Scott Pioli As New GM</a> (227 words)</p>
