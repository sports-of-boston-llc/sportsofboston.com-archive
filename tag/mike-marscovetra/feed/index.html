(boston.com)" ></a><p>Sophomore RB Josh Haden and Redshirt Freshman QB Justin Tuggle have both decided to transfer from Boston College today. Both have seen less and less playing time as the year has gone on.</p>
<h3>Justin Tuggle lost the starting QB job and apparently fell to at least third on the depth chart</h3>
<p>Although never said it out loud, the Tuggle transfer seemed imminent with him sitting third on the depth chart recently after starting the first three games. Tuggle’s athleticism was his greatest asset at QB, but he was never accurate and had a tendency to heave down field jump balls even when no one was open. In his first two games against Kent State and Northeastern, he threw for 206 yards and three touchdowns, but against Clemson he fell apart on a dismal 4-20 outing with three interceptions. When true Freshman Mike Marscovetra came in to replace a struggling Dave Shinskie against Virginia Tech instead of Tuggle, it looked like Tuggle’s window of opportunity at BC shut. Even after a rough performance by Shinskie against a weak Notre Dame defense, Tuggle was no longer confident in his chances to succeed at Boston College. Highly touted incoming QB Chase Rettig would have put Tuggle in an even further hole next year if he stayed.</p>
<h3>Montel Harris&#8217; stellar play earning him most of the touches</h3>
<p>What caused more of a stir was the move of Haden from Chestnut Hill. After coming in as the key recruit of the Jeff Jagodzinski era (spurning offers from Florida, Michigan, and Ohio State), Jagodzinski handed Haden the starting spot as a true freshman. Jags believed Haden fit the mold of a fast pass catching tailback perfectly, which fit into then offensive coordinator Steve Logan’s spread offense. Lightly recruited and ex-Duke commit Montel Harris quickly earned a spot in the rotation and ended up gaining 421 more yards on 59 more carries. He had more receiving yards. The duo ended up second in the nation for freshman running back tandem and carried that chemistry into this year with Montel Harris changing his number from 42 to 2 to literally become a 1-2 tandem with Haden.</p>
<p>Harris ran wild this season (with the exception of the Wake Forest game) and, after dominating the Florida State game, never looked back. Haden is currently averaging 1.4 yards less per carry than Haden and 1.1 yards less than promising true freshman Rolandan Finch. His tendency to dance in the backfield and inability to break tackles has greatly hampered his play. Josh Haden’s brother Joe currently plays on the Florida Gators and is one of the top corners in the nation.</p>
<p>Head Coach Frank Spaziani wished both players well.</p>

(AP Photo/Don Petersen)" ></a><p>After BC&#8217;s debacle at Virginia Tech, they look forward to a visit from Tom O&#8217;Brien and the NC State Wolfpack. Here are some observations from last week.</p>
<h3>Despite a horrendous day at quarterback, Dave Shinskie looks like he will start again</h3>
<p>A few players say they see no need to change QBs and that the offensive line’s lack of protection had just as much to do with the terrible performance as did Shinskie’s play. For the record, Shinskie threw twelve passes with only one completion to his own team and two to Virginia Tech. The pick-six Shinskie threw in his red zone was unforgivable as he stared down his receiver the entire play and everyone in the stadium knew where it was going. This recurring problem should trouble Eagle fans as he doesn’t have the presence of mind to check down to other receivers or is under too much pressure and does not have enough time to throw to anyone else. If the latter is the problem, why not put QB Justin Tuggle in to buy some time?  Wasn’t Tuggle benched for putting up the same type of performance at Clemson? It seems a little unfair to give Shinskie a longer leash.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/10/15/five-eagle-eyed-thoughts-on-week-6/">Five Eagle Eyed Thoughts on Week 6</a> (462 words)</p>

(AP Photo/Lisa Poole)" ></a><p>Looking back on the opening game of the season, here are five observations on the BC Football team.</p>
<h3>Freshman QB Mike Marscovetra should have redshirted</h3>
<p>He clearly stands as number three on the depth chart, eons behind Justin Tuggle and Dave Shinskie. Senior QB/FB Codi Boek would have been serviceable in third string. Even if the other three QBs get hurt or share a strain of swine flu, Marscovetra would still have been able to take off his redshirt, but now it looks like a year of riding the pine and wasting eligibility.</p>
<h3>Sophomore Colin Larmond looked good</h3>
<p>With a solid frame of 6’3-196, Larmond showed speed and strength on a 41 yard pass from Tuggle and he almost made an even more impressive play on a Shinskie jump ball at the end of the second quarter. Boston College needs a big receiver to step up next to the 5’11 Rich Gunnell since 6’5 Ifeanyi Momah is on the ice and 6’5 Justin Jarvis is mainly ineffective when put in the game.</p>
<h3>More MLB Luke Kuechly!</h3>
<p>Pronounced KEEK-ly, Kuechly might be my favorite newcomer. Despite weighing a diminutive 225 pounds, Kuechly led the team with seven tackles and a pass breakup in three quarters of work. He flew all over the field and looks like he might take over one of the outside linebackers spots once middle linebacker and team captain Mike McLaughlin returns.</p>
<h3>It will be interesting to see how Boston College will use OLB Dominick LeGrande</h3>
<p>At 6’1-192, Legrande may be the lightest linebacker in the ACC, but may also be the fastest. Georgia Tech uses rover Morgan Burnett, an all-ACC performer, in a capacity where he roams from run to pass coverage. Burnett is 20 pounds heavier and might be the exception and not the rule to the rover position. We will find out soon if LeGrande can hold up against the run when Clemson comes by in two weeks.</p>
<h3>Really, Boston College?</h3>
<p>Coach Frank Spaziani and the gang sent an email to all the student body for football tryouts on September 14. I understand if you want to find the next Rudy or Steve Aponavicius, but shouldn’t the tryout be during the summer practices if you want to get something out of the players. Either BC must be hurting for more players or this tryout is just a dog and pony show. I’m guessing the former. I personally think Boston College is seeking a kickoff specialist after the horrid performance from Ryan Quigley and Steve Aponavicius.</p>
<p>So, there are this week&#8217;s observations. What do you think?</p>
