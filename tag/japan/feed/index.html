There have been some surprises, and some expected results. From the defending world champions in action, to the much-hyped U.S. vs. England, to the host nation South Africa kicking things off, there was plenty of action to see. Just in case you missed it, here are some of the highlights, and lowlights, so far.</p>
<h2>The Biggest Surprise: Paraguay ties Italy</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s not just that Paraguay is ranked 31st in the world and Italy is fifth. It&#8217;s that the reigning World Cup champions came out with such a lackluster performance that they should be lucky to have just tied the game. Paraguay had only one shot on goal and Antolin Alcaraz made it count. After only one game, many are criticizing the Italians&#8217; effort and are wondering if this is really a team that has aspirations of repeating as champions?<br />

Four teams (Giants, Dodgers, Red Sox, and Padres) have reportedly offered Takahashi a minor-league deal.</p>
<p>The draw for Takahashi in Boston is obvious: the Sox employ two prominent Japanese pitchers in Daisuke Matsuzaka and Hideki Okajima. The Sox would do their very best to make Takahashi feel at home in Boston, despite its long distance from Japan.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/02/06/red-sox-target-japanese-lefty-hisanori-takahashi/">Red Sox Target Japanese Lefty Hisanori Takahashi</a> (54 words)</p>

<p>Hideki Okajima pitched a scoreless ninth inning and earned the win as the Sox bats woke up in extra innings. In the 10th, Manny Ramirez doubled home David Ortiz and Julio Lugo after Big Papi was intentionally walked before him. Papelbon was shaky in the bottom of that inning, allowing three hits and 1 ER, but escaped with the save in a 6-5 win.</p>
<p>Rookie RF Brandon Moss, a late addition for an injured J.D. Drew, hit a game-tying home run in the ninth off of Huston Street to knot the game at 4-4.</p>
<p>Japan native Daisuke Matsuzaka started and looked shaky early on against the A’s, allowing 2 runs in the first, but he settled down to go 5 innings. He did not get the win after Kyle Snyder failed to hold the lead in the sixth inning.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Red Sox showed why they&#8217;re the WORLD Series Champions, by every meaning of the phrase.</p>
<p>The Sox have impressed thus far in Japan, beating the Hanshin Tigers and Yomuri Giants in exhibition play. In the first game against the Tigers, the Red Sox won 6-5. David Ortiz and J.D. Drew had home runs as the Sox beat their Japanese equivalent. The Tigers are most-often compared to the Red Sox due to thier fantastic following.</p>
<p>In the second game on Sunday morning, the Sox again won, this time 9-2 over the Yomuri Giants in the Tokyo Dome. J.D. Drew belted another homer, this time a grand slam. He had 7 RBIs in the two exhibition games. After the win over the Giants, he said, simply, “[I’m] Mr. Japan.”</p>
<p>Sox righty Daisuke Matsuzaka will start on Opening Day (Tuesday) in his first game back in his native country while playing for a major league team.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday&#8217;s mandate by the Red Sox was historic to younger baseball fans, but to those who have followed the game for at least 40 years, it probably seemed like business as usual. To anyone who has very closely followed how Bud Selig has run MLB&#8217;s front office, it was the old used car salesman making another appearance. I happen to think the Red Sox players made the morally correct decision, but that it was even an issue is sad enough in a day and age where MLB is more profitable than ever before. Revenues for the game are now rising faster than salaries, and yet, somewhere in the process, coaches being compensated for a trip to Japan was left out of the agreement.</p>
<p>Ever since free agency became legal in baseball, there has been a struggle between ownership and the players association to try and grab every last bit of power available and use it to get what they want. From collusion to the 1994 strike to the recent steroids policy, the commissioner and the head of the players association have tried to wield their power in an attempt to position their side for a better financial windfall. That Selig and MLB did not immediately cave in on the issue at hand yesterday should surprise nobody familiar with baseball labor history.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was nearly a hiccup in the plan for the Red Sox to jettison to Japan after their final spring training game against the Blue Jays. Early this morning the Sox players voted unanimously to boycott the game against the Jays and the trip to Japan if their coaches and trainers were not given compensation for the trip.</p>
<p>Apparently the players were to receive stipends on the trip but the coaches would not be receiving any compensation. The situation quickly escalated into a players only meeting in which the Sox players voted not to play or travel until the situation was resolved.</p>
<p>After nearly an hour delay, the Sox and MLB did come to an agreement on payment and the Sox took the field against the Jays and now are headed off to Japan.</p>
<p><strong>My Take:</strong> This story kind of came out of nowhere. I find it very hard to believe that MLB would not give any compensation to coaches or trainers on the trip. We&#8217;ll see where the story goes but the bottom line is, the Sox are off to Japan to open the season against the Oakland A&#8217;s on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The Red Sox will take advantage of another opportunity to make a little more money when the team travels to Japan at the beginning of the regular season. They have stuck a deal with EMC to display a patch on the right sleeve of their uniforms, the first time in Red Sox history they have ever put an advertisement on their jersey.</p>
<p>EMC is interested in tapping into a lucrative Japanese market, while the Red Sox are looking for even more ways to make added revenue.</p>
<p>Apparently, advertisements on jerseys are commonplace in Japan, just not here in the U.S.</p>
<p>More from the Boston Herald&#8217;s Scott Van Voorhis:</p>
<blockquote><p>The deal, which is with MLB Japan, is likely to cost EMC in the six figures, one leading sports business expert said.</p>
<p>“The fact that it is on the uniform makes it a unique sponsorship,” said Marc Ganis, head of Chicago-based SportsCorp.</p>
<p>Sox players and coaches, including Terry Francona, will wear specially designed sleeve patches featuring both the EMC and Japan 2008 logos.</p>
<p>The games will be broadcast both in the Japanese market and back home through the New England Sports Network (NESN).</p>
<p>EMC will also get hundreds of tickets to the two March games against the Oakland As, which the company will use to entertain customers and business partners.</p></blockquote>

<p>This series would provide the perfect opportunity for Daisuke Matsuzaka and Hideki Okajima to head back home and play in front of their native country and fans.</p>
