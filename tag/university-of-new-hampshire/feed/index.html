The Northeast and Midwest Regionals will send their members to the Frozen Four on Sunday to trim the field to four.

<p>With RIT another four seed making the Frozen Four, history is being made again this season. Saint Cloud got its first tournament victory, RIT has its first two in the program&#8217;s first postseason appearance, and Alaska made their tournament debut, albeit a loss. Yale also recorded its first tournament victory since 1952.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/03/27/bc-moves-on-unh-shut-down/">BC Moves on, UNH Shut Down</a> (742 words)</p>

New Hampshire, playing in an evening contest, got off to a slow start, trailing 1-0 with three minutes to go in the second period to Cornell and their goalie, Ben Scrivens. Scrivens had not allowed a goal in three games and only one in their four ECAC playoff games as the Big Red won the league title.</p>
<p>However, UNH came to life at the end of the second with a goal from Hobey finalist Bobby Butler that went through the side of the net. Mike Sislo scored 26 seconds later to change the complexion of the game entirely, giving UNH an edge they would never cede. Cornell went from a team content to nurse a 1-0 lead and let Scrivens carry them to a scurrying team that just could not organize itself, especially on offense. This was best evidenced in Butler&#8217;s second goal, in the third period, which put UNH up 4-1 and really iced the game. Cornell attempted to take the puck out of the zone, but just lost it and Butler emerged with the puck, going the other way, and beat Scrivens one-on-one.</p>
<p>Just to show that it was not Cornell&#8217;s day, Butler was on the ice to go for the hat trick while Cornell pulled the goalie for the extra attacker. Paul Thompson got the puck on the left side with what looked like a sure goal, but dished it over to Butler, on the right side in traffic. Instead, Cornell broke up the pass, but in doing so, directed the puck right into the net, crediting the goal to Thompson. Butler, Thompson, and Sislo each recorded two goals. Brian Foster recorded 24 saves in the win.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/03/27/unh-rips-cornell-vermont-penalties-spell-doom/">UNH Rips Cornell; Vermont Penalties Spell Doom</a> (370 words)</p>

<p>Maine scored two power play goals in eight chances, with their 25% efficiency actually being down from their near 30% mark coming into the game.

Denver solidified its grip on first with 46 of 50 first place votes, while Miami remained in second with the other four votes. Wisconsin, BC, and North Dakota complete the top five. Hockey East gained representation in the poll with Maine and BU re-joining the poll in the final two spots, 19 and 20, respectively. New Hampshire fell two spots to 13 after its quarterfinal loss to Vermont. The victory propelled Vermont up five spots to 14.</p>
<p>Conference tournaments wrap up this weekend and the brackets will be announced Sunday. Hockey East features #2 BC vs. #8 Vermont and #3 BU vs. #4 Maine Friday with the winners playing Saturday night (SoB preview can be found <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/03/14/hockey-east-semis-set-as-unh-upset-bc-sweeps/">here</a>). With the formula that the Selection Committee follows, BC is a lock and UNH is very likely to get in, however, there are scenarios that leave BC as Hockey East&#8217;s only representative and others giving the league as many as four teams (BC, UNH, Vermont, and BU or Maine). Vermont does not need to win the tournament, but if they do not, they need help. BU and Maine must get the autobid to get in.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BC took three of four points from UNH in their series in the final weekend of Hockey East regular season play, but the one point was enough for the Wildcats to clinch the league&#8217;s title. The pollsters continue to favor the Eagles, who are up to fourth in this week&#8217;s USCHO.com Division I Men&#8217;s Hockey poll. UNH slipped one spot to number 11. The top spot has been held by only Denver and Miami this season and Denver reigns this week with a 976-972 margin. The Pioneers grabbed more first place votes as well, 26-24. Wisconsin and North Dakota sandwich BC, giving the WCHA three teams in the top five. Vermont slipped three places to 19 and UMass-Lowell rejoined the poll at number 20.

This was the second time the Wildcats had overcome a three goal deficit to tie the Eagles in as many games this season. BC got revenge on Saturday night in Chestnut Hill in a nearly meaningless game as BC has the second seed locked up.</p>
<p>While UNH and BC were settling the top two seeds, most of the remaining teams were scrambling just to get into the playoffs. Eight of the ten teams make the playoffs and only three teams had locked up a berth going into the weekend and only Providence was eliminated. After the music stopped, Northeastern was the odd team out after dropping two one-goal contests to BU. Merrimack replaced the Huskies as the only change in the eight teams to make the playoffs compared to last season.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/03/06/unh-wins-hockey-east-playoff-picture-set/">UNH Wins Hockey East, Playoff Picture Set</a> (1,131 words)</p>
