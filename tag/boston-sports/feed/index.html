<p>In case you haven’t noticed, the Boston sports teams are all in a state of disarray. The Red Sox are quickly becoming the laughing stock of Major League Baseball with one of the highest payrolls in the league and a collection of underperforming players.</p>
<p>The only bright spot on the team thus far has to be the emergence of left handed pitcher Eduardo Rodriguez. Since being called up on May 29th against the Texas Rangers, Rodriguez has posted impressive numbers by going 2-0 with a microscopic 0.44 era and 21 strikeouts.</p>
<p>In probably the most disappointing team of the year, the Boston Bruins have to make some much needed changes this offseason. It started with Peter Chiarelli departing for Edmonton and hiring Assistant General Manager Don Sweeney to General Manager. The team also decided to part ways with Carl Soderberg. Recent trade speculation has been swirling around that defenseman Dougie Hamilton is seeking a deal worth up to $8 million per season, which may be too rich for the Bruins’ taste and <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/nhl/post/_/id/38249/rumblings-offer-sheet-for-dougie-hamilton" target="_blank">a possible trading partner could be no other than Chiarelli and the Edmonton Oilers</a>, as stated by Pierre LeBrun of ESPN.</p>
<p>Even though the Celtics made the playoffs this year, they may have been better off going into the lottery as they are trying to reposition themselves in the draft to get a higher selection. They have four draft choices this year. They are unlikely to keep all of those picks, as they will be looking for trading partners or use a few on European players and stash them overseas for a few years. Even though a man appearing to be <a href="http://nesn.com/2015/06/lamarcus-aldridge-spotted-in-boston-reason-for-visit-unclear-photo/" target="_blank">LaMarcus Aldridge was spotted at Logan Airport last week</a>, it is likely that he will sign with a team from Texas, according to ESPN’s Ric Bucher. It will be interesting to see what Danny Ainge has up his sleeve this summer, but if they keep to this model, it will be a few years until they can seriously go themselves serious contenders and out of the purgatory which is being mediocre in the NBA.</p>
<p>The Patriots have made a lot more noise off the field than they would have preferred. Star quarterback Tom Brady could potentially miss up to four games and they have released their first three starting cornerbacks in Darrelle Revis, Brandon Browner, and Kyle Arrington respectively. Longtime staple in the defensive line, Vince Wilfork, has moved on to play for the Texans. The Patriots will also have to forfeit a 2016 first round pick and 2017 fourth round pick. The Patriots have to turn to second-year quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo to fill the void of Brady’s absence.</p>
<p>In order of fan base confidence, it has to be the Patriots, Bruins, Celtics, and last and certainly least, the Red Sox. One might feel as though the Bruins and Celtics can be interchangeable based on the number of draft assets that Danny Ainge has to work with and the high volume of question marks surrounding this Bruins team. The two that are not debatable, however, are the Patriots and Red Sox. The Patriots are coming off of a Super Bowl win. Albeit difficult to repeat in the NFL, it anyone can do it, it is Bill Belichick and the Patriots, especially in a weak AFC Conference. <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25066031/2015-nfl-strength-of-schedule-steelers-at-no-1-falcons-at-no-32" target="_blank">As John Breech of CBSSports.com noted, the Patriots have the 11th easiest schedule in the league</a>.</p>
<p>It is tough to look someone in the eye these days and say that you have confidence in these Red Sox. They blew a 7-run lead to the Toronto Blue Jays last night, which is nothing short of an embarrassment. Take into account the clubhouse, especially <a href="http://nesn.com/2015/06/wade-miley-i-let-my-emotions-get-the-best-of-me-in-dugout-blowout-video/" target="_blank">Wade Miley’s meltdown with John Farrell in Baltimore Thursday night</a>. As a fan, you always want your team to succeed. However, this team doesn’t deserve to win the way they have been playing.</p>
<p>It is an interesting time to be a fan in Boston with a lot more question marks than answers. Hopefully they will be in our favor sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
John O’Callaghan, an objective Boston Sports Fan</p>

<h2>Why the Hate?</h2>
<p>Apparently, not everyone is entirely happy with ESPN Magazine’s decision to release an issue only about Boston sports, but they’re not from Boston, so they must not be smart enough to understand. Seven championships. Two World Series plus three Super Bowls plus one Basketball Championship plus one Stanley Cup.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2011/09/25/boston-sports-featured-on-espn-magazine-cover/">Boston Sports Featured on ESPN Magazine Cover</a> (431 words)</p>
