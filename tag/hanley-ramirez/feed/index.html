In just this month only, David Ortiz passed Mickey Mantle on the all time home run list, Rick Porcello reached 20 wins (21st win Monday), Hanley Ramirez was named AL Co-Player of the week on Monday, and Boston now sits in a comfortable four game lead in the AL East.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t been watching the Red Sox play this month then you&#8217;ve been missing out on some great games. They have been playing superb baseball as the post season is right around the corner. The Sox just came off a four game series sweep on the New York Yankees. A series in which Hanley Ramirez homered four times. The series was started off with a monster three run walk off home run from Hanley himself. He now has 28 homers and 106 rbis on the season. Not only is Hanley hitting timely home runs but he has been <strong>DESTROYING </strong>these home runs. I was at Fenway a week ago when the Sox had a 12-2 win over the Orioles and he hit one of the farthest home runs I&#8217;ve ever seen hit over the green monster. I&#8217;m not kidding, it never came down it just kept going up. I seriously think that ball got lost in Mars&#8217; orbit.</p>
<p>On a side note, after ace Rick Porcello picked up his 21st win Monday night over Baltimore, it seems like he may have locked himself in on the AL Cy Young Award. He now is 21-4 on the season and the only competition behind him is J.A. Happ of Toronto who holds a record of 19-4. But Porcello holds a better, ERA, WHIP, and strike out count than Happ. Boston has 12 games left to play in the season so Porcello should probably get a couple more chances to add some wins to his already stellar record.</p>
<p>All that being said, the Red Sox are HOT right now and it couldn&#8217;t come at a better time in the season. The Sox don&#8217;t show any sign of slowing down and are hopeful to play strong into the playoffs. October baseball is almost among us and I&#8217;m very optimistic for great things coming to the city of Boston in the near future.</p>

Coming into Thursday only one game ahead of Baltimore, the Red Sox had some pressure on them. What started off as a slow night turned into one to remember. Heading into the bottom of the ninth at Fenway, the Sox were trailing the Yankees five to one.</p>
<p>Note to self: <strong>NEVER LEAVE A SPORTING EVENT EARLY.</strong></p>
<p>The Sox rallied in the ninth as David Ortiz drove a line drive up the middle to put run number two on the board. Next  up, Mookie Betts drives another run in to make it a two run deficit. Then Hanley Ramirez steps to the plate. Dellin Betances throws a handful of breaking balls to Hanley. When the count showed 3-1, Betances reared back and threw a fastball right down the middle. Ramirez connected with the pitch and hit an absolute moonshot three run home run over the center field wall. Hanley knew it was gone right off the bat, as some may say he &#8220;pimped it&#8221; as he walked down the line and held his bat high in the air.</p>
<p>Hanley gracefully trotted around the bases and then was mauled by his teammates at home plate. The home run was Hanley&#8217;s 25th of the year and it also jumped his rbi count to 100. This win was so important with the AL East standings being so close between the Sox, Orioles, and Blue Jays. Boston now sits in first place and two games ahead of Baltimore. Every game in September is an important win as the Sox are nearing the end of the regular season. Boston has three games remaining in their series with the Yankees.</p>
<p>Not only was tonight a night to remember for Hanley, but also for David Ortiz. In the bottom of the eighth inning, Ortiz hit a line drive home run to center field. It was his 34st homer of the season and also the 537th of his career, passing Mickey Mantle on the all time home run list. David now sits at 17th all time. It&#8217;s really going to be something when he leaves the game.</p>

When it came to the Red Sox, some might have said Mookie Betts or Xander Bogaerts, but Schoenfield listed Yoan Moncada as the Sox&#8217;s most untradeable player. Moncada would command a king&#8217;s ransom at the deadline, and he is certainly a player that the Sox will be hoping to use next season. When the Cuban signed for $31.5 million, few were expecting him to rise as quickly as he did to Double-A ball, but the 21 year old has shown he is already worth the huge amount of cash.</p>
<p>Moncada is listed as the number 5 prospect in Major League Baseball, and his scouting report draws comparisons to Robinson Cano (with more speed). Paired with Andrew Benintendi, the number 21 overall prospect, the future in Boston is bright.</p>
<p>So, where does that leave the Red Sox next year? Some players and their positions are set in stone, such as Bogaerts at shortstop and JBJ in center. The areas of need, if one is to nitpick, would be left field, third base, and first base.</p>

<p>June is firmly in the rearview mirror for the suddenly wicked hot Boston Red Sox, and for at least 24 hours, doubts and criticisms have been silenced.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, the Red Sox needed only a one-run home run from Brock Holt to take the victory, but they graciously accepted a three run shot from Big Papi to provide all the run support that Rick Porcello would need. Porcello looked strong, earned his tenth straight win at home, and the Sox shut out the team with the best record in the majors. It was a feel good win, reminiscent of Octobers past, and indicative of Octobers future.</p>

It might be easy to say that it&#8217;s not surprising that Buchholz struggled against a Rangers team with the best record in the American League, especially with how Buchholz&#8217;s season has gone this year. But John Farrell used his faith in Buchholz to justify not bringing up a reliever from Pawtucket a night after <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8185&amp;position=P">Steven Wright</a> did not make it out of the fifth inning, and two nights after <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=3184&amp;position=P">David Price</a> didn&#8217;t make it out of the third. Most Red Sox fans already knew that faith was misguided, and were not surprised when Buchholz allowed the first six batters he faced to reach base, putting giving the Rangers an immediate lead they would not give up. Buchholz also walked more batters (5) than he struck out (3), further illustrating why he was demoted to the bullpen earlier in the season. Sadly the Red Sox find themselves thin on options as far as starting pitching is concerned, but there really is no reason to send Buchholz back out for another start. He has had more than his fair share of chances in Boston, and he has proven that the only thing he can be counted on to do is under-perform.</p>
<p>A few more notes from Sunday&#8217;s game:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=10607&amp;position=OF">Bryce Brentz</a> went 2-for-3 with a solo homer, the first of his Major League career. It will be interesting to see if the Red Sox try to get Brentz some playing time in Left Field going forward, as his bat could be starting to heat up. His main competition in Left, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=10700&amp;position=OF">Ryan LaMarre</a>, has done absolutely nothing with the bat since coming up from Pawtucket, so there should be plenty of playing time available for whoever is performing at the moment.</li>

Photo: Maddie Meyer/Getty Images" ></a><p>Last summer, more than a few Red Sox fans were more worried about Hanley Ramirez&#8217;s lackluster season in left field than they were about his mediocre season at the plate. This year, Hanley looks as though he was born to play first base, relieving pressure that surrounded that decision at the end of spring training.</p>
<p>However, Ramirez is beginning to worry casual fans and fanatics alike due to his hitting woes. Multiple articles have been published highlighting his struggles, including one from Matt Collins from Over the Monster, who writes: &#8220;The defense has been great, but it doesn&#8217;t mean a ton if the offense continues to struggle like this&#8230;we may be seeing a new Hanley Ramirez, and it&#8217;s not one any of us wanted to see&#8221;.</p>
<p>Alex Speier of the Boston Globe reported on the seventh, three figures that may be the main factors behind Ramirez&#8217;s &#8220;decline&#8221;. As he puts it: &#8220;His 52.5 percent ground-ball rate represents a career worst. He’s striking out more than ever (20.7 percent), and when he does take the bat off his shoulder, he’s swinging and missing 24 percent of the time — a drastic increase for a player who has never had a rate in excess of 19 percent&#8221;.</p>
<p>Certainly, Hanley has no room to breathe in Boston, and if he wishes to win the affection of the media circus that surrounds his baseball team, then the production has to increase quickly. Ramirez did smash a home run against the Orioles this past week, snapping a long ball drought that was well over a month long, and upping his total to five on the season.</p>
<p>If hearing that Hanley Ramirez only has five home runs at this point in the year didn&#8217;t make you cringe a little, then I&#8217;m not sure what will.</p>

Jackie sits comfortably in the number three spot (over 937,000 votes) right behind Mike Trout and Lorenzo Cain. He is expected to be a starter in the All-Star game. Meanwhile Ortiz and Bogaerts both lead the AL with votes in their positions. But these are not the only three Sox players that may make the All-Star game this July.</p>
<h2>Potential Sox Players to Make ASG:</h2>
<ul>
<li>DH David Ortiz</li>
<li>SS Xander Bogaerts</li>
<li>OF Jackie Bradley Jr.</li>
<li>OF Mookie Betts</li>
<li>2B Dustin Pedroia</li>
<li>1B Hanley Ramirez</li>
<li>3B Travis Shaw</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sox have a chance a pretty good chance to bring a decent amount of players to the All-Star game, but it shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise to anyone. The Red Sox are the best hitting team in the MLB. They are first in runs (342), hits (610), doubles (152), total bases (1015), RBIs (329), AVG. (.290), OBP (.355), SLG (.482), and OPS (.837). They lead in almost every major offensive statistic so it wouldn&#8217;t be a shocker if half of the starting lineup ends up All-Stars this season. At one point during the season, six of the nine starting players were batting over .300 which is ridiculous. These guys are proving that they are a dominant force on the offensive side and they are really trying to make a name for themselves this year.</p>
<p>Now their pitching is another story. Everyone knows that Boston&#8217;s weakest part of their game is their pitching. But they do have some solid pitching from David Price, Rick Porcello, and Stephen Wright. If any pitchers from the Sox were going to make the All-Star game, I would have to say it would only be Porcello. He is 7-2 on the season with a 4.04 ERA. But I honestly don&#8217;t think Porcello will make it. If he had another win or two and had a lower ERA then yes he probably would make the team.</p>
<p>This time of year is looking very different from where the Sox were last year. The only player from Boston to make the All-Star game was Brock Holt. Now Holt has been hurt for a while with a concussion so we haven&#8217;t seen him so he&#8217;s out of the question for this year&#8217;s game. But to go from one All-Star to potentially four, five, maybe even six All-Stars in one year is a huge improvement.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how the voting ballots end up and who leads in each category. I want to see our players at the top of the food chain come July. But its up to <strong>YOU</strong> Boston fans to cast your vote and get our boys to the All-Star game. So head on over to MLB.com and vote! You can vote a total of 35 times total and five times a day. If I could vote 35 times a day I would but I also have no life so that&#8217;s just me.</p>
<p>Happy Voting</p>

The bats were cold, the pitching was atrocious, and the attitude in the clubhouse was reflective of a team who truly didn&#8217;t care. While I managed to convince myself that the Sox could turn it around a few different times over the course of the summer, it was at this point when I knew this was truly a lost season. There is NOTHING worse as a baseball fan than knowing your team is out of the hunt before the dog days of summer even begin. This frustration was magnified by the thought that most Sox players seemed to be content with their shoddy, second-rate performances.</p>
<p>No player better exemplified this disinterested demeanor than Red Sox left fielder Hanley Ramirez. The Hanley/left field experiment was beginning to take shape as a catastrophe of epic proportion. At this point, Hanley&#8217;s hot April bat had long since cooled, and he was a walking (not running, because Hanley does NOT run down fly balls) blooper reel in the outfield. The thing that was most frustrating about Hanley in left was his unwillingness to work at his craft. Whispers from the clubhouse that he wasn&#8217;t putting the time in were growing increasingly loud in volume. A phantom &#8220;hamstring&#8221; injury mercifully ended Hanley&#8217;s time in left, and the Sox began to look toward next year with a plan in place to try Hanley at first base.</p>
<p>Fast foward 365 days later. The Sox are in first place at 29-17, and Hanley has yet to make an error at first. His bat, while lacking in power, has been a consistent all year long. He&#8217;s no longer swinging his helmet off trying to launch a 700 foot homer on every cut, and the results are a much-welcomed increase in doubles and opposite-field hits.</p>
<p>What has Hanley changed you ask? Did he go to a wellness retreat? Did he find God? I&#8217;d argue that he truly didn&#8217;t change much. What has changed is that the Sox are winning baseball games.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re going good, a guy like Hanley, with his happy-go-lucky, carefree attitude is a welcomed commodity. It&#8217;s the sort of personality that can help to keep things light and fun in the clubhouse, something many teams need over the course of a grueling 162 game season.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re going bad, a Hanley Ramirez-type is a cancer. No one wants a whimsical, nonchalant guy in the clubhouse when the team is getting their doors blown off on a nightly basis. It&#8217;s similar to when you&#8217;re in a bad mood and someone tries to tell you a joke and it makes you even more angry. Get the hell out of here and let me be mad.</p>
<p>Keep doing you, Hanley. As long as Ortiz, Bogaerts, and JBJ keep mashing, I have a feeling this is going to be a fun summer for all of us.</p>

<p>For example, look at today&#8217;s game against the Houston Astros. Ortiz went 3-5 with a Home run, a game tying triple in the bottom of the ninth, and then a game winning double in the bottom of the 11th.  If it wasn&#8217;t for Hanley Ramirez bunt attempt in the bottom of the ninth, we might not have got the Ortiz dramatics(that everyone is used to) in the 11th.  So thanks for that Hanley.  Anyways this was Ortiz first game ever with a, double, triple, and a home run in the same game.  Also he joined a rare club today  joining Hank Aaron and Barry Bonds as the only players in history to have 500 Home runs and 600 doubles in their career.  Today was also Ortiz 20th game winning hit not counting the postseason, and we all know what he&#8217;s done there; sorry Yankee fans.</p>
<p>Ortiz wants to win bad, and you can tell his teammates want to win for him in his final season.  This team has good chemistry right now, they can&#8217;t wait to get to the ballpark on game days and enjoy each others company.  With the weather getting better expect more of the same from Ortiz and the rest of the lineup.</p>
<p>See you in October Boston.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5">Top of the ninth, bases loaded, one out, down by one run, Big Papi is up. Nobody else you&#8217;d rather have at bat in this situation. Ortiz had a great chance to capitalize late in the game and put the Sox in the lead but had his chances stolen from him by not one, but two very questionable strikes called by home plate umpire Ron Kulpa.</span></p>
<p>One of the best closers in baseball, Andrew Miller, found himself in a jam as the Red Sox had bases loaded as Big Papi came to the plate. Ortiz worked a 3-1 count. Miller delivered a low and outside slider for a called strike making it a 3-2 count. Ortiz immediately turned to Kulpa with his arms spread wide and yelling &#8220;NO!&#8221; as he did not agree with the call. John Farrell rushed to Ortiz to restrain him because the at bat was not over and they still needed him to hit. Farrell backed up Ortiz and continued to deliver some pretty heated words towards Kulpa as he ejected the Sox manager from the game.</p>
<p>Still visually upset, Ortiz still had a job to do at the plate. The next pitch was again delivered low and outside but was even lower than the previous pitch. Ortiz watched it for strike three as Kulpa rung him up. Ortiz put his head down and walked back to the bench. But when he got to the dugout, he snapped and ran out to Kulpa screaming his head off. John Farrell and other members of the team had to restrain Ortiz from ripping Kulpa&#8217;s head off for the two bad calls against him.</p>
<p>The game should have been tied with 1 out and Hanley Ramirez at the plate but that wasn&#8217;t the case. Those two picthes were balls, I don&#8217;t care what anybody says. According to the &#8220;K-Zone,&#8221; Kulpa <strong>missed 31 calls </strong>in last night&#8217;s game. The 3-2 strike called on Ortiz was reported to be five and half inches below the strike zone. That&#8217;s a pretty big screw up in a tight game like that, especially between the Sox and Yanks.</p>
<p>Everyone knows those were bad calls. The umpire missed the first one but missing the second one too is a big no no, you just can&#8217;t do that. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen Ortiz that mad before. We&#8217;ve all seen him mad but last night was something else. If I saw Papi sprinting at me like that, I don&#8217;t even know what I would do with myself. He was down right scary last night.</p>
