<p>As of now we&#8217;ve all seen the Brady hype videos, and starting tomorrow we finally get to live it.  Let&#8217;s face it, it&#8217;s been a long 4 weeks.  Jimmy G and Jacoby Brissett did their jobs, even tho Garoppolo should have played last week but that&#8217;s a discussion for another time.  However as of tomorrow we don&#8217;t have to worry about those two anymore (hopefully).  Tomorrow we finally get our hall of fame quarterback, back on the field where he belongs.</p>
<p>The Players or Brady himself won&#8217;t say what tomorrow will be like, but lets face it they&#8217;re going to try to give the middle finger to the rest of the league.  Do I think Brady could be rusty?  Well yes, any player who hasn&#8217;t seen game action in nearly 5 weeks will be rusty.  What I do know is Brady is pissed off, he won&#8217;t tell you how he feels but his father will.  Brady&#8217;s father has multiple times called Goodell a &#8220;liar&#8221;, and has called the NFL &#8220;a kangaroo court&#8221;.  If Brady&#8217;s dad is this upset imagine how his son feels?  Brady was booed at the Super Bowl 50 ceremony, had his name dragged through the dirt for nearly the past 2 years, has heard all the talk about Garoppolo will be Brady&#8217;s successor, and all the talk that Brady is just a &#8220;system quarterback&#8221;.</p>
<p>Remind you this is a guy who has a clock in his house.  This clock is not set to his wife&#8217;s birthday, his kids birthdays, his anniversary, or any other significant moment in his or his loved ones lives.  This clock in his house is set to February 5th, 2017, 6:30 pm.  This is the date and time of Superbowl 51.  Where he expects to be.  For a guy that has played his whole career with a chip on his shoulder, now he has a boulder on it.  Expect the revenge tour to start tomorrow and there&#8217;s no telling when it will end.  Sleep good tonight New England fans, tomorrow football Jesus is back.</p>
<p>Pats -42, Cleveland-10.</p>

<p><strong>Top Picks</strong></p>
<p>Eli Manning</p>
<p>Manning is playing the woeful Saints this weekend.  The Saints have the worst pass defense in the NFL, going into sunday they started 3 defensive backs who have never played a snap in the NFL.  I fully expect Eli and Odell to put up massive points this weekend.  Last season when Eli played this Saints defense he threw for 350 yards and 6 touchdowns.  He will be the most owned quarterback this weekend, but should be well worth it.  Eli and Odell are my number 1 stack of the week.</p>
<p>Allen Robinson</p>
<p>Robinsons price on draftkings dropped from $8300 to $7800, which means he should be higher owned this week.  Robinson had a team high 15 targets last week, expect more of the same this week and for Robinson to break 100 yards and score at least a touchdown.</p>
<p>David Johnson</p>
<p>Johnson is the main running back in Arizona.  When Arizona ran the ball last week it was with Johnson 84% of the time.  Johnson might go under the radar for some people this week as I expect people to fade the Cardinals due to their performance last week.  Don&#8217;t fade Johnson as he will be the key to a successful game by Arizona this week.</p>
<p>Emmanuel Sanders</p>
<p>Sanders is only 6k on draftkings this week, which is ridiculously low for a number 1 wide receiver.  Demaryius Thomas is battling through injury and the terrible Colts defense are traveling to Denver.  Expect Sanders to get most of the targets on sunday.</p>
<p><strong>Sleepers</strong></p>
<p>Steve Smith</p>
<p>Smith had 9 targets for 5 receptions and 19 yards in week 1, I know that&#8217;s terrible.  However Baltimore is traveling to Cleveland who just got burnt by Carson Wentz.  Flacco loves to throw to Smith and I expect the same this weekend.  Smith won&#8217;t be a popular play this week due to his performance last week, but don&#8217;t jump off the bandwagon just yet.</p>
<p>Marcus Mariota</p>
<p>Mariota is a very good tournament play this week.  He didn&#8217;t play well in week 1, he has a great matchup against Detroit, and Demarco Murray and Tajae Sharp looked better than expected last week.  This game should be a shootout and Mariota will be a big part of it.</p>
<p><strong>Risky Stack Of The Week</strong></p>
<p>Jimmy Garoppolo/Julian Edelman</p>
<p>Historically when Miami comes to New England the pats spread them out and throw it all over the yard, yes that is when Tom Brady is on the field.  However I expect the same gameplan from The Pats this week.  Garoppolo should be getting rid of the ball quick and finding one of the best possession receivers in the league in Julian Edelman.  Edelman should see 10 targets minimum this week and will score a touchdown.</p>

Tommy, Tom, Tom. We had a good fight, didn&#8217;t we? We ruffled some feathers, tangled with authority, and left nearly no stone unturned in an effort to clear the name of the greatest quarterback of all-time. But in the end, there was nothing even the GOAT himself could do to combat the outright hypocrisy and lunacy of one Roger Goodell. The battle to prove Tom&#8217;s innocence was underhanded and unfair from the jump, and I for one think it&#8217;s time to move forward with Garappolo under-center for weeks 1-4.</p>
<p>When this whole Deflategate fiasco began some 543 days ago, it appeared as though Tom Brady would have an opportunity to prove what he has maintained since day one&#8211; that he had no knowledge regarding the deflation of footballs during the 2014 AFC Championship game. Throughout this exhausting legal process, it started to become clear that Tom&#8217;s innocence would have no bearing on whether or not his suspension would be eradicated.</p>
<p>What became the harsh reality for Tom and the rest of Patriot Nation was that Roger Goodell, the tyrant, set himself up with absolute, unbounded power when the CBA was put into place a few years back. Due to this stranglehold, Goodell was able to flip Brady&#8217;s case completely upside down and make it about his right to enforce his discipline regardless of a player&#8217;s innocence, or any other factor for that matter. Essentially, if Roger Goodell doesn&#8217;t like the way you cut your hair, he can suspend you for three games. If Goodell thinks you made fun of his hair piece behind closed doors, that&#8217;s four games.</p>
<p>This coming from a man who refused to acknowledge the facts (video evidence) that Ray Rice knocked his fiancee unconscious in an elevator. A man who has turned a blind eye to domestic violence, performance enhancing drugs, and several other infractions that have had a MUCH larger effect on the reputation and integrity of his game than an ALLEGEDLY deflated football used in a game that the Pats won by 38 points.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve said all along, the Brady suspension is a blessing in disguise for the Pats. Tom will have an extra four games of rest, and he will come back to a bevy of talented receivers DYING to catch passes from one of the best to ever lace them up. The extra rest will be huge for Brady and the Pats come playoff time. In addition, it will give the Pats a chance to showcase Jimmy Garappolo, who is nearing the end of his rookie deal and could be used as a trade chip moving forward with a solid performance in the first four weeks.</p>
<p>So enjoy the extended vacation with your super model wife and millions and millions of dollars, Tom. We&#8217;ll be ready for you to return week five and drop a 50 burger on those poor, poor Cleveland Browns. WE STAND WITH TOM.</p>

<p>Jimmy Garoppolo is a question mark around the league.  Nobody, not even Garoppolo knows what he can be in the NFL.  Drafted at pick number 62 in the 2014 draft he never has had a legitimate shot in the NFL, I mean most quarterbacks who come in to back-up Brady never get a shot.  While he has only appeared in 11 games in his career Garoppolo does have some impressive stats for a back up.  While he only has one touchdown pass in his career he has been really good at taking care of the ball which is usually a struggle for young quarterbacks.  A completion percentage of 64.5 and a rating of 91.9 has people saying that he could be the second best quarterback in the AFC east.  Garoppolo playing well through the first 4 games could benefit not only him but the Patriots future also.</p>
<p>With all the bad quarterbacks in the NFL today Garoppolo playing well means he could be a trade piece this offseason.  Some team that is in desperate need of a quarterback will come around and offer a first round pick for Jimmy G, and when the opportunity presents itself Belichick has to jump all over it and trade Garoppolo.  This is best case scenario for The Pats.  There is no quarterback controversy, and you and the rest of the league gets a look at your backup.</p>
<p>In my opinion Brady will be around for at least the next 3 seasons, so after Garoppolo gets through these first 4 games it&#8217;s time to ship him out.</p>

And guess who they ranked number one? Yes, our New England Patriots.</p>
<p>I was actually blown away when I saw this for a couple reasons. One being that ESPN has constantly covered everything and anything bad they hear happening with the Patriots. Including covering every waking second of Deflategate. From the rants I&#8217;ve seen on that show, I don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s too many Pats fans over there at ESPN which is why I&#8217;m surprised they ranked them at the top seed. But that&#8217;s just my bias opinion. And two, mainly because Tom Brady apparently won&#8217;t be playing until the fifth week due to his Deflategate suspension.</p>
<p>Even though Brady is most likely not going to play for the first four games of the season, do not count them out. From the looks of it most people would say that the Patriots have done a very good job this off season with the draft and free agent pick ups. Here are some new notable players to keep an eye out for this upcoming season:</p>
<h2>New Players to Keep an Eye On</h2>
<ul>
<li>TE Martellus Bennett</li>
<li>WR Chris Hogan</li>
<li>G Jonathan Cooper</li>
<li>DE Chris Long</li>
<li>WR Nate Washington</li>
<li>CB Cyrus Jones</li>
<li>DT Anthony Johnson</li>
</ul>
<p>It looks like the Pats and Jimmy Garoppolo have their work cut out for them as they play in Arizona against the Cardinals for Game 1 of the season. But Patriots fans do not worry. We have one of the most diverse and intricate running games in the league along with many different running backs of all shapes and sizes. Our wide receiver positions just got even stronger with the adds in of Nate Washington and potential slot receiver Chris Hogan. The Pats have arguably the best tight end scheme in the entire NFL with Rob Gronkowski and Martellus Bennett. They have improved their defense with add ins at the LB, DT, and CB positions. The biggest question Patriots fans are left with is, can the offensive line protect the quarterback?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know I&#8217;m not a doctor, but I sure hope so.</p>
