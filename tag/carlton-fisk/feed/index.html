The event took place just prior to the Red Sox facing the Chicago White Sox.</p>
<p>The recent Hall of Fame Inductee was honored at the ballpark and fans were given a miniature Hall of Fame plaque detailing some of his career statistics as well as player history. During the event a video highlight was shown on the jumbotron giving fans, players, and coaches a chance to admire Pedro&#8217;s supremacy on the mound and his charisma in the dugout and clubhouse. The video also featured Martinez career stats, which got the crowd roaring before he even took the field. So many of the numbers are staggering however a few that got a rise out of those spectating included the following: The 313 strikeouts in 1999, which was Pedro&#8217;s single-season career-high and a Sox franchise record. His 1.74 ERA in 2000, which was ridiculous, keeping in mind the juiced-up players he was fanning on a nightly basis. Then, last but not least, the .760 winning percentage (117-37) with the Red Sox between 1998-2004, best in the majors in that time span.</p>
<p>Martinez, accompanied by his wife and children, waited excitedly as Red Sox legends came out to congratulate him on his accomplishments. It all started with a video message from Nomar Garciaparra, who recalled being inducted into the Latino Hall of Fame with Martinez, he was asked to use two words to describe the sensational ace and said, &#8216;The Best,&#8221; which may simply be the most accurate description.</p>
<p>The ceremony was led by the voice of the Red Sox, Joe Castiglione, who called on Sox greats such as Carl Yastrzemski, Jim Rice, Dwight Evans, Dennis Eckersley, and Carlton Fisk to present Pedro with gifts and memorabilia. One unique gift was a bronze mold, covered in gold, of Pedro&#8217;s huge hands and freakishly long fingers. It was, after all, these fingers that allowed him to force righties out of the batters box, waving at that up and in, high-rising fastball and then make most who faced him look foolish with a one of a kind change up. Martinez was also presented with a laptop computer full of video highlights of his career from teammates Curt Schilling, Trot Nixon and Orlando Cabrera. A special thank you and a call to review &#8216;El Tiante&#8217; Luis Tiant all-time numbers for further accolades was made by Pedro during his speech. He also thanked former Expos manager Felipe Alou as well as Ralph Avila, the scout who first discovered Martinez at a young age in the Dominican Republic. Sox favorite Tim Wakefield made an appearance and presented the Martinez family with a donation to his charity. Pedro also took time for heartfelt gratitude aimed at all the fans in Red Sox Nation.</p>
<p>It was David Ortiz that set in motion the unveiling of #45, which will now forever be a part of Fenway Park and the Red Sox organization and never again be worn by a Sox player. Ortiz spoke to the Fenway Faithful to address Pedro&#8217;s amazing career but also his genuine personality that New England came to fall in love with during his time in Boston.</p>
<p>Before Martinez could finish his speech, he brought out his catcher Jason Varitek to share the moment with him calling it &#8220;his moment, too.&#8221; This was apparently off script as Varitek was to come out for the first pitch, to this Martinez said, &#8220;Hey, this is Pedro,&#8221; and, much to the delight of the crowd, referred to the celebration as &#8220;my party.&#8221; The Hall of Fame pitcher took the mound for the final time in front of a standing ovation as he threw out the first pitch, high and tight of course, to his battery-mate Varitek.</p>
<p>In Pedro&#8217;s career he was voted onto eight All-Star teams, and won three Cy Young Awards while piling up 3,154 strikeouts, 219 wins, and a 2.93 career ERA. Pedro recently received 91.1 percent of the vote to be inducted into the Hall of Fame, joining this years class of baseball legends. Whether it was blowing away the side or taping a player to a post in the dugout, Martinez was as integral a part of the Red Sox as there was at the turn of the millennium. Pedro dazzled all those who watched him with his electric fastball, majestic change-up and infectious smile. His dominance as a pitcher and his leadership in the clubhouse helped Boston reverse the curse and win the 2004 World Series. Pedro&#8217;s role on that team, and the greatness of his Red Sox career will never be forgotten, and now remembering is just as easy as turning your head toward right field.</p>

Rather than reading like a droll history novel, it is more of a collection of 13 different topics relating to the Red Sox, their players, their history and whatever other fun tidbits fans, athletes and media have come up with. In addition to media and team figures, the book features stories directly from fans that are the epitome of the loyalty and respect Boston fans have for their beloved baseball team.</p>
<p>Not only is the book packed with historical facts and trivia, but their are also some pictures scattered throughout to further illustrate topics; some of the pictures are quite old and rare, which makes it even more fun to have a direct link to the memories of the past, especially for those of us who happened to be alive during those famous (and sometimes infamous) moments. The occasional anecdote separated from the main body of a chapter makes the reader feel even more like they&#8217;re right there with everyone else instead of holding a stack of paper (or some sort of tablet, for the techie crowd).</p>
<h2>Chapter 1: First Experiences</h2>
<p>After a brief foreword, introduction and preface, the book kicks off its introduction with a few stories from some lifelong and die-hard fans about their introductions to the Boston Red Sox and Fenway Park. From a man whose father immigrated from Italy to native residents of Massachusetts, everyone just has a natural attraction to the Red Sox. The camaraderie and history of fans draw others to them and inspire great loyalty. The biggest fans among them even do everything in their power to make the Red Sox a part of their career.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2013/06/15/book-review-how-the-red-sox-explain-new-england/">Book Review: How the Red Sox Explain New England</a> (963 words)</p>

While I would no longer have to reintroduce my fist to my face with every Tek tapper to the second baseman, the reins were left in the hands of <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/28663/jarrod-saltalamacchia" target="_blank">Jarrod Saltalamacchia</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/6200/kelly-shoppach" target="_blank">Kelly Shoppach</a>.</p>
<p>Discounting the 2010 season that saw him play all of 12 major league games, Saltalamacchia couldn’t break .300 with his on-base percentage in his last two seasons. Meanwhile, Shoppach spent the past two years trying and failing to coax his batting average over .200. And that’s without mentioning what Josh Beckett would resort to drinking and eating without his personal catcher on hand.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2012/06/16/kelly-shoppach-jarrod-saltalamacchia-and-the-unexpected-catching-controversy/">Kelly Shoppach, Jarrod Saltalamacchia and the Unexpected Catching Controversy</a> (543 words)</p>

<p>For his part, Varitek played along saying he has &#8220;defied odds before.&#8221; The sort of longevity Tuck describes would place Varitek alongside Carlton Fisk as the model of catcher durability throughout a career. Assuming he can stay healthy into his 40s at the game&#8217;s most physically demanding position, would any team be eager to sign him to catch any number of major league games? It would certainly be hard to imagine Varitek&#8217;s time with the Red Sox continuing whether Victor Martinez stays or goes. Varitek himself picked up a player option to remain with the team for 2010 after the Red Sox declined an option of their own to retain the catcher at a higher salary.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/03/23/what-to-do-with-jason-varitek/">What to Do With Jason Varitek</a> (469 words)</p>

<p>Rice’s No. 14 will be the seventh Red Sox number retired and eighth overall, following the league-wide retiring of Jackie Robinson’s No. 42.

<p>Rice is third in Red Sox history in hits, home runs, and RBI behind both Yaz and Williams respectfully.  He will now join his fellow leftfielders in two highly selective groups, starting with Cooperstown and then in Boston.  They are both just reminders of the impact Rice has had on not just the Red Sox, but in the game of baseball himself.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/07/23/red-sox-to-retire-jim-rices-number/">Red Sox to Retire Jim Rice&#8217;s Number</a> (443 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a lot of fanfare around the fact that the Red Sox haven&#8217;t visited Cincinnati since 1975 when the upstart Red Sox met up with the <strong>Big Red Machine</strong> in the World Series. The Red Sox did win a game there, leading to the Game 6 dramatics when <strong>Carlton Fisk</strong> willed his HR fair. You know the history. Well, recent history suggests that the Red Sox should destroy these Reds, highlighted by two World Series victories and the fact that they swept the Reds in a three-game series at Fenway Park in 2005.</p>
<p>With all that said, <strong>Aaron Harang</strong> (3-9) silenced the Red Sox bats in a 3-1 victory. Harang lasted seven innings, allowing one run on four hits with seven strikeouts. <strong>Jay Bruce</strong> led of the game with a HR and <strong>Adam Dunn</strong> added a solo shot of his own to power the Reds to the win. <strong>Justin Masterson</strong> (3-1) earned his first career loss, allowing three runs on four hits and three walks, to go along with nine strikeouts in 6 2/3 innings.<br />
