<p>As of now we&#8217;ve all seen the Brady hype videos, and starting tomorrow we finally get to live it.  Let&#8217;s face it, it&#8217;s been a long 4 weeks.  Jimmy G and Jacoby Brissett did their jobs, even tho Garoppolo should have played last week but that&#8217;s a discussion for another time.  However as of tomorrow we don&#8217;t have to worry about those two anymore (hopefully).  Tomorrow we finally get our hall of fame quarterback, back on the field where he belongs.</p>
<p>The Players or Brady himself won&#8217;t say what tomorrow will be like, but lets face it they&#8217;re going to try to give the middle finger to the rest of the league.  Do I think Brady could be rusty?  Well yes, any player who hasn&#8217;t seen game action in nearly 5 weeks will be rusty.  What I do know is Brady is pissed off, he won&#8217;t tell you how he feels but his father will.  Brady&#8217;s father has multiple times called Goodell a &#8220;liar&#8221;, and has called the NFL &#8220;a kangaroo court&#8221;.  If Brady&#8217;s dad is this upset imagine how his son feels?  Brady was booed at the Super Bowl 50 ceremony, had his name dragged through the dirt for nearly the past 2 years, has heard all the talk about Garoppolo will be Brady&#8217;s successor, and all the talk that Brady is just a &#8220;system quarterback&#8221;.</p>
<p>Remind you this is a guy who has a clock in his house.  This clock is not set to his wife&#8217;s birthday, his kids birthdays, his anniversary, or any other significant moment in his or his loved ones lives.  This clock in his house is set to February 5th, 2017, 6:30 pm.  This is the date and time of Superbowl 51.  Where he expects to be.  For a guy that has played his whole career with a chip on his shoulder, now he has a boulder on it.  Expect the revenge tour to start tomorrow and there&#8217;s no telling when it will end.  Sleep good tonight New England fans, tomorrow football Jesus is back.</p>
<p>Pats -42, Cleveland-10.</p>

<p>Since Belichick was hired he&#8217;s been to 6 super bowls and 10 conference championship games.  Yes having Tom Brady helps, but no team in history has been able to sustain success like Bills Patriots have.  Belichick is so great for many reasons, but his greatest attribute is knowing when to let go.</p>
<p>Players like Lawyer Milloy, Richard Seymour, Deion Branch, Ty Law, Vince Wilfork were all players that Belichick had to make a tough decision on.  No, all these players weren&#8217;t just cut off the team, some were free agents who Bill saw decline in.  I&#8217;m sure Belichick loved all these players, but when a younger and more importantly cheaper player comes in and can do the same job, Bill seems to go that route.</p>
<p>Belichick has done a lot for The Patriots organization, this team was nothing without him.  Yes Brady has helped, but Belichick&#8217;s drafting, developing, decisions and most importantly him being the general manager are all things that most other coaches can not do.</p>
<p>When he is all done coaching he will go down as the Greatest Coach Of All Time.</p>

The press conference started with statements and stories of gratitude and greatness in regards to the legendary 18-year veteran by Broncos President and CEO Joe Ellis, followed by Vice President of Denver football operations and legend in his own right John Elway, as well as current head coach Gary Kubiak. The speeches highlighted Manning&#8217;s greatness as a player in Indianapolis and Denver but also focused on his leadership, organization and community contribution, teamwork, and personal relationships he had with everyone involved with him in Denver. In a split screen on ESPN one could see the three aforementioned speakers giving examples of his illustriousness career in all capacities mentioned above with an emotional Peyton Manning doing his best to fight back tears.</p>
<p>When it was Peyton&#8217;s turn to speak he was as he usual is during interviews and media gatherings, all class. He had difficulty containing his emotions but did get through his speech which was full of career highlights and woes, stories of his first days on the NFL gridiron, and reflections on what specific moments in time meant to him both playing the game and interacting with players past and present in those moments.</p>
<p>Manning alluded to the Patriots on more than one occasion, the following is transcript from his speech: &#8220;I’m going to miss a steak dinner at St. Elmo&#8217;s in Indianapolis after a win. My battles with players named Lynch, Lewis, Thomas, Bruschi, Fletcher, Dawkins, Seau, Urlacher, Polamalu, Harrison, Woodson and Reed. And with coaches like Fisher, Ryan, Belichick, Kiffin, Phillips, Rivera, LeBeau, Crennel, Capers, Lewis, the late Jim Johnson, and so many more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ll miss that handshake with Tom Brady and I’ll miss the plane rides after a big win with 53 teammates standing in the aisles, laughing and celebrating during the whole flight. I’ll miss playing in front of so many great fans both at home and on the road. I’ll even miss the Patriots fans in Foxborough, and they should miss me because they sure did get a lot of wins off of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a player Peyton Manning was always someone New England fans loved to hate, but now it is time to give Peyton his due, to honor his greatness, and to respect his legacy as one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever put on the uniform.</p>
<p>Bill Belichick was quoted as saying: &#8220;For 18 years, we battled fiercely but regardless of each game&#8217;s outcome, I always walked off the field with the utmost appreciation for the highest level of competition in which those games were prepared for and played. Peyton&#8217;s immense contributions to the game reflect how genuinely passionate he is about it. I can honestly say that I never &#8216;enjoyed&#8217; our meetings, but the respect I have for Peyton Manning as a competitor was, and will likely remain, second to none.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Brady on the Monday Morning Quarterback Show had this to say: “What just happened, winning the Super Bowl in his last game, is a perfect way to end a career. But what he’s accomplished through all these years, what makes it so admirable, is the pressure he’s had on him his whole life. He was the highest-rated recruit in high school. He was the biggest quarterback in college football. He was the first pick in the draft. Who has lived up to the expectations year after year after year as well as Peyton? He’s done it so gracefully, so admirably. He set the standard for how to play the quarterback position.”</p>
<p>The drama provided over the years by the Brady vs Manning match ups has been unbelievable, for so many seasons these two quarterbacks were at the top of their game and their places in history will be forever intertwined. The level of preparation and surgically precise execution as well as competitive fire and Super Bowl contending teams made the contests some of the most well-played and exciting games of the era.</p>
<p>Peyton&#8217;s success can be measured with his statistics and accolades which include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>-Most all-time passing yards: 71,940</p>
<p>-Most all-time passing touchdowns: 539</p>
<p>-Most all-time career wins (regular season and post season): 200</p>
<p>-Most all-time regular season wins: 186 (Tied with Brett Farve)</p>
<p>-Most all-time game-winning drives: 56</p>
<p>-Most all-time Pro Bowl Selections: 14</p>
<p>-Most all-time 4,000+ yard seasons: 14</p>
<p>-Most single season passing yards: 5,477</p>
<p>-Most single season touchdowns: 55</p>
<p>-Most NFL MVP awards: 5-time winner</p>
<p>And the thing that one would imagine Manning is most proud of (even if Eli isn&#8217;t psyched about it) is being a 2-time Super Bowl Champion.</p>
<p>Manning has countless other statistics that are impressive if not the best all-time but what fans can appreciate about Manning is that he was a student of the game and he respected the game as much as anyone who has ever played it.</p>
<p>As much as New England fans have hated Peyton Manning over the years, there is no match up that has been looked forward to more. The conversation of &#8216;who is the better quarterback&#8217; in regards to Brady and Manning has been had in about every sports bar in New England and probably many places around the country. Wherever fans land on this is their own perspective from their own experiences but one thing is for sure both of them could make a case for the best all-time. There has rarely been a television event that is more must-see TV than Brady vs Manning, Patriots vs Colts/Broncos over the last 15 seasons.</p>
<p>Manning finished his speech with this to say: &#8220;When I look back on my NFL career, I’ll know without a doubt that I gave everything I had to help my teams walk away with a win. There were other players who were more talented but there was no one could out-prepare me and because of that I have no regrets.</p>
<p>&#8220;There’s a scripture reading, 2 Timothy 4:7: I have fought the good fight and I have finished the race. I have kept the faith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I’ve fought a good fight. I’ve finished my football race and after 18 years, it’s time. God bless all of you and God bless football.&#8221;</p>
<p>The final touch on the final day of his career was one of class, grace, and respect for the players, the fans, and the game of football.

Blame the O-Line, blame the kicker, blame the play calling from McDaniels, even blame Tom Brady and the ducks he threw up for grabs resulting in two picks. For me, personally, I blame Bill Belichick and Josh McDaniel&#8217;s arrogant play calling in Miami earning the Patriots a week 17 loss and sending them to Denver for the AFC Championship rather than hosting it. The Patriots ran the ball 27 times for 70 yards, averaging 2.6 yards per carry. With multiple 3rd and long plays the coaching staff elected to run the ball and then punt. Only when it was too late did they allow Brady to throw and then the whole plan to protect Brady and establish a run game was out the window with the Dolphins getting pressure on every pass play, running through the Pats porous offensive line and leaving Brady tits up in the backfield for a good portion of the second half. Whoa, now that I got that out, I think I can move on.</p>
<p>The season is over and the grieving process has begun. As part of this process Tom Brady issued a handwritten letter to fans via Facebook. In the letter Brady thanks the fans for all the support over the season and states his pride in calling New England his home. A nice touch from Brady in a tough time for the team and New England fans. The AFC Championship was difficult to watch, with an un-Patriot-like performance allowing for mistakes, turnovers, and lack of execution. Outside of the defense from New England, this will not be a game with many positive things to look back on. Brady and the Pats never gave up, with big conversions down the field and then ultimately in the endzone to Gronkowski there was a glimmer of hope at the end but fell a 2-point conversion short.</p>
<p>Hopefully next season New England fans will once again see the well-oiled machine known as the Patriots offense with a better protection plan for TB12. One thing is for certain, New England will have a new offensive line coach, and, most would imagine, a differently looking offensive line to start next season.</p>
<p>On the upside for Patriot Nation, Tom Brady will return next year with a top notch core of receiving weapons, again be the favorite in the AFC East and a threat to go to Super Bowl 51. That cannot be said for Denver, this may be the last run for Ol&#8217; Peyton Manning. So enjoy the Super Bowl Pat&#8217;s fans, no need to yell at the TV, or holler at whoever is reaching for nachos, blocking the game on a key third down, just enjoy the beer and truck commercials and watch the game like a casual sports fan, you know, like people from outside of New England.</p>

The Chiefs were dominant on defense and forced a shaky Houston offense into a borderline embarrassing performance. Kansas City was able to get after Houston quarterback Brian Hoyer forcing a fumble and four interceptions. Despite the pressure put on by the Chiefs defensive line Hoyer was also his own worst enemy making terrible decisions, particularly in the red zone. Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith and the KC offense was efficient against a tough Houston defensive that held them to just six points in the first half however they led 13-0 at the break thanks to a 106-yard kickoff returned for a touchdown by Knile Davis to start the game. In the second half the Chiefs were able to open up the lead as Hoyer and the Texans continued to shoot themselves in the foot. Kansas City, playing on the road, was not phased by the 71,000 screaming  fans or defensive stud J.J. Watt who they avoided with quick hitting pass plays, screens, sweeps and extra manpower. Alex Smith finished the day 17 of 22 for 190 yards with a touchdown and a rare interception, coach Andy Reid&#8217;s experience and game plan worked perfectly. Kansas City is now riding an 11-game win streak coming into Foxborough for next week&#8217;s divisional round playoff match up and should be as confident as ever.</p>
<p>One key problem for the Chiefs is the status of star receiver Jeremy Macklin who has been a go to guy for Alex Smith all season. Macklin suffered and injury to his ACL late in the second half of the win in Houston and did not return. He is due to have an MRI today to assess the extent of the damage, KC fans will be crossing their fingers in hopes that Macklin does not have a tear in that right knee. Maclin caught 87 passes for 1,088 yards and eight touchdowns during the regular season. Also banged up coming into the game against the Patriots will be Tamba Hali with a thumb and knee injury who had limited action against the Texans but is a key figure in the pass rush for KC that will be essential to getting pressure on Tom Brady, the formula for disrupting the flow of the Patriots offense. Linebacker Justin Houston also seemed to tweak his knee which has been a lingering injury for him this season causing him to miss five games.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2016/01/10/pats-draw-streaking-chiefs-for-divisional-round-playoff/">Pats Draw Streaking Chiefs For Divisional Round Playoff</a> (519 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to the Steelers win over the Bengals last night, the Patriots will host the Chiefs on Saturday at 4:30 pm in their Divisional playoff game. The chiefs defeated the Texans 30-0 earlier yesterday. The meeting will be the first time the two teams have faced each other since Kansas City blew out New England in week four of 2014. Since that game, the Patriots have lost a total of six games and won Super Bowl XLIX.</p>
<p>The Chiefs come into the game as the hottest team in the NFL, winners of 11 straight games. They are led by pass rush extraordinaires Justin Houston and Tamba Hali. Their defense also features Eric Berry at safety, Derrick Johnson at linebacker and a star rookie at corner in Marcus Peters.</p>
<p>Alex Smith has led the Chiefs offense that has come into its own this season, using a stable of running backs to move the ball. Travis Kelce is a solid tight end who gave the Patriots problems last season and if healthy Jeremy Maclin is a big playmaker for Kansas City. Andy Reid is no stranger to facing Bill Belichick, the two have squared off five times including  Super Bowl XXXIX.</p>
<p>The Chiefs are a physical team that will come into Foxboro not fearing the Patriots. The quality of opponent they faced in the Wild Card round was low, but they are team that can force turnovers and slow the Patriots offense down. The key for New England will be staying out of any second or third and long situations in order to avoid having to deal with Hali and Houston in an obvious passing situation. The Patriots should win this game, but the Chiefs present a solid test and will take advantage of any Patriots mistakes.</p>

Since Bill Belichick has been the coach of the team they&#8217;ve only lost two games in a row 11 times, including Sunday&#8217;s game. It&#8217;s a luxury most teams in the NFL have not been afforded. When it happens in New England it&#8217;s easy to expect doom and gloom from all the talk shows because something must be wrong, right? The good news about Sunday&#8217;s game is that it can easily be chalked up to an anomaly.</p>
<p>&#8211; Let&#8217;s start off with that absolutely stupid fake, drop kick that they made Nate Ebner attempt. I definitely understand trying to practice these trick plays in real game scenarios which is why I was 100% in agreement with the onside kick against the Redskins. Obviously it&#8217;s easy to look at the onside kick against Washington with positive eyes since the play worked. Even if that play failed they were firing with a loaded gun on offense with Julian Edelman, Danny Amendola, Rob Gronkowski, and Dion Lewis all healthy and playing. If the onside kick fails and the Redskins score, the Patriots still had their full offense to gain the points back. On Sunday they were playing without Lewis, Edelman, Gronk, and Amendola has been hobbled with a bum knee. What is the point to trying that play in that situation? The only thing it did was anger the Eagles for &#8220;disrespecting&#8221; them and it gave life to a team that was down 14-0, on the road, and has already shown a track record for giving up in the middle of games. (...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/12/09/notes-and-observations-week-13-patriots-embarrass-themselves-at-home-lose-to-eagles-35-28/">Notes and Observations Week 13: Patriots Embarrass Themselves at Home, Lose to Eagles 35-28</a> (1,026 words)</p>
