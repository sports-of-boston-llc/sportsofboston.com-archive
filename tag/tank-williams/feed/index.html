				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Teams:</strong> Kansas City Chiefs (0-0) vs. New England Patriots (0-0)<br />
<strong>The Terms:</strong> Regular Season Week 1<br />
<strong>The Place:</strong> Gillette Stadium, Foxboro, MA<br />
<strong>The Time:</strong> 1 p.m.<br />
<strong>The Channel:</strong> CBS<br />
<strong>3 Burning Questions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em>How will Brady play?</em> Having missed all four preseason games, all eyes are on Tom Brady to see how the two-time Super Bowl MVP will perform. Is his foot hurt? If so, how much? Does it really matter against such a terrible team? The answers: Yes, not that bad and absolutely not. Brady could throw for 30 TDs on one foot over the course of a season and against a Kansas City team which will start more than a couple rookies on defense, Brady shouldn&#8217;t have a problem brushing off the rust. Look for a stat line similar to 25-35, 250 yards, two TDs and a pick. He&#8217;ll find receivers at will and look like the No. 12 we&#8217;ve come to love.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Safety/Linebacker Tank Williams &#8211; who just signed for the Patriots in the offseason &#8211; has been placed on injured reserve and is out for the season.</p>
<p>Williams hurt his knee against the Ravens while playing on special teams. There is no official word on the extent of the injury.</p>
<p><strong>My Take:</strong> This really is a huge blow for the defense. Williams looked as though he would be a versatile addition to the defense at the safety and linebacker position. He&#8217;s a hard hitter and strong tackler. His absence leaves a big hole in the depth of the defense. The Patriots have signed veteran safety Jeff Shoate, but to lose Williams so early in the season is a bad omen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Patriots have been busy filling holes in the secondary with multiple signings in the last few days. Here&#8217;s a quick summary of each player:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jason Webster (CB) &#8211; Webster, 30, signed a one-year, $730,000 contract on Tuesday. Webster has spent time with the 49ers, Eagles and Bills but has struggled with injuries the past few seasons. His upside is his experience, the downside being the injuries and his size (5&#8217;9&#8243;). Projects to play nickel corner.</li>
<li>Tank Williams (S) &#8211; Williams, 27, signed a one-year deal on Wednesday. Known primarily as a hard hitter, Williams has played for the Titans and most recently the Vikings. Williams is 6&#8217;2&#8243; and 223 pounds and looks to compliment James Sanders and Rodney Harrison in safety coverage. He missed the entire 2006 season due to injury and has five career interceptions.</li>
<li>Lewis Sanders (CB) &#8211; Signed just yesterday, Sanders, 29, signed a one-year deal. He&#8217;s played with the Browns, Texans and Falcons during his eight year NFL career. He has ideal size (6&#8217;1&#8243;, 210 pounds) and five career interceptions. He will most likely be a fixture in dime situations and utilized often in special teams.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>My Take: </strong>I think it&#8217;s important for the Patriots to continue to fill bodies into the secondary, even if the talent isn&#8217;t great on paper. Jason Webster has struggled with injury but can be a decent corner if he stays healthy. I don&#8217;t know much about Lewis Sanders but I like the signing of Tank Williams. He may not be an every down guy but I always love a guy who&#8217;s not afraid to take a chance and light up someone. I don&#8217;t think these signings have solved all the problems on defense, but I&#8217;m starting to think (along with a lot of other experts) that we&#8217;re going to see a lot of Brandon Meriweather at cornerback in the 2008 season.</p>
<p>Ty Law is still out there and I think if the Patriots brought him in and then drafted a cornerback in the early rounds of the draft, the secondary would have a good mixture of veterans and youth to be formidable in the AFC East.</p>
