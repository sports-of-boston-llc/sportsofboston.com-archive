(Image from 25stanley.com)" ></a><p>The Bruins filled their assistant coaching void on Wednesday, hiring former Canadiens assistant Doug Jarvis to be the new &#8220;eye in the sky.&#8221;  Jarvis will watch all of the team&#8217;s games from up in the press box, as assistant coach Doug Houda has done for the past three seasons.  Houda has been asked to move behind the bench for the upcoming season, filling the role that Craig Ramsey held.  Ramsey was hired as the head coach of the Atlanta Thrashers earlier this off-season.</p>
<p>Jarvis has work ethic and winning in his blood.  He enjoyed a very successful 13-year playing career from 1975 to 1987, winning four consecutive Stanley Cups with Montreal from 1976 to 1979.  He is the NHL&#8217;s version of Cal Ripken Jr., as he currently holds the league record for consecutive games played at 964 straight, never having missed a game throughout his entire NHL stint.  During his career, he totaled 139 goals and 264 assists.  Like Ramsey, Jarvis has a Frank J. Selke Trophy to his credit, winning the award for the NHL&#8217;s best defensive forward back in 1984 (Ramsey won his in 1985).  He also was awarded the Bill Masterton Trophy in 1987, which goes to the player who &#8220;exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to the sport of hockey.&#8221;(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/08/05/doug-jarvis-hired-as-bruins-assistant-coach/">Doug Jarvis Hired as Bruins Assistant Coach</a> (184 words)</p>
