				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That question is most certainly the one you ask when you build as big a lead as the Patriots did on that <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/10/18/patriots-beat-down-titans-59-0/">Sunday afternoon against the Titans</a>. Tom Brady was pulled just after the start of the third quarter in favor of backup quarterback Brian Hoyer. Many have questioned whether it would have been better to leave Brady in longer and see if he could break the NFL record for TD passes (7) and total points (72). Quite frankly, I believe those people are short-sighted in their critique of Bill Belichick&#8217;s decision. Tom Brady has his name next to plenty of records already, and two more would be unnecessary at best, dangerous at worst.</p>
<p>The main reason to pull a quarterback is to protect him from injury. When said quarterback already has suffered a major injury once, it makes even more sense to limit his playtime. The risk was amplified by the severe weather conditions under which the Titans-Patriots game was played. A snowy, icy field makes it hard to get one&#8217;s footing, and it would have been easy for Brady&#8217;s feet to slide out from under him or twist the wrong way along the ice. The game was out of reach, so why risk an injury to the most important member of your team? The argument that it would give Brady more time to work on his mechanics falls in the face of the injury issue. Brady&#8217;s passing mechanics may have improved marginally (and he was throwing pretty well before he left; he had a <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/10/21/cracking-the-code-brady-and-the-perfect-passer-rating/">passer rating of 152.8</a>) if he continued to play in the second half, but the risk of injury is far greater than the opportunity to get a little better.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/10/26/reaching-for-nfl-single-game-records-to-pull-or-not-to-pull/">Reaching for NFL Single Game Records: To Pull or Not to Pull?</a> (436 words)</p>
