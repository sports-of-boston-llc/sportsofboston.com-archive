				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my third installment of 2008 season grades I&#8217;ll be taking a look at the wide receivers and tight ends.</p>
<p><strong>Randy Moss: B+</strong><br />
<em>Thoughts:</em> After a record breaking 2007 season it was going to be tough for Moss to follow up his performance with anything but a let down statistically. Throw in a brand new quarterback and you have a recipe for disaster. However, despite some uncharacteristic drops (against the Steelers particularly) and some pundits *ahem* Michael Felger *ahem* saying he took some plays off, Moss still had a pretty good season. Along with his 1,008 yards and 11 touchdowns Moss came up big in some games, including his miraculous TD catch as time expired against the Jets. He showed that he has a lot left in the tank for 2009.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our next stop on the postseason grading tour of the 2008 Patriots are the running backs, who were perhaps the most scattered position on the team with injuries.</p>
<p><strong>Laurence Maroney: C-</strong><br />
<em>Thoughts:</em> Count me as a person who has completely jumped off the Laurence Maroney bandwagon. After a decent rookie season Maroney has been nothing but hurt or ineffective for the Patriots. This year was no different as the former first round pick had just 93 yards on 28 carries (3.32 yards per carry) and zero touchdowns. Maroney played just three games before being placed on IR for a shoulder injury. 2009 will be a make or break year for Maroney as without him the Patriots three headed monster at running back seemed to work pretty well. I hope for his sake his injury problems are behind him or we could see him take the Chad Jackson route right out of town.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is the first installment of my end of the year grades for the 2008 New England Patriots. We&#8217;ll start with the most talked about position on the team for many reasons, the quarterback.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Cassel: A</strong><br />
<em>Thoughts:</em> We all thought the worst when Tom Brady suffered his career ending injury in Week 1 against the Chiefs. I was at Gillette for the game and even though Cassel did a great job pulling out the win, I remembered how horrid he looked in the preseason and figured the Patriots were screwed. Though I still thought they could win nine or 10 games with their schedule I had no idea Matt Cassel would turn into the player he did. His stats were impressive (3,693 yards, 21 TDs, 11 INTs, 89.4 passer rating), his pocket presence drastically improved and his ability to take over and win a game understated. For a guy who sat on the bench since high school, Cassel improved leaps and bounds in every aspect of his game and now the Patriots have quite a chip to either trade or keep in case Brady isn&#8217;t ready for 2009. What he brings to the table that Brady doesn&#8217;t is the ability to run with the football when needed. There were innumerable plays this year when Cassel scrambled out of the pocket to pick up big first downs. Whatever team he ends up playing for in 2009 will have a competent, hard working and skillful quarterback.<br />
