				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For three consecutive years, the Terriers have been preseason selections by America East coaches and by several sports related websites, such as ESPN and CBS Sports, to advance to the NCAA tournament, but BU has failed to do so since 2002. This year, which started out so promising, seems to have the same trend as previous Terrier basketball teams over the past five years. The Terriers currently find themselves in fourth place in the America East standings at 8-5, but the team has been unable to string together victories or defeat any of the teams above them in the conference.</p>
<p>Since their previous two game losing streak, BU easily defeated UNH (69-47) and Albany (68-53), before a heartbreaking 76-75 loss against Vermont. Boston University has three home conference games left against America East competition, along with a bracket buster matchup at Delaware, where the Terriers look for their third consecutive win in the collegiate wide invitational. This is a key stretch of four games that will lead up to the America East Conference Tournament, March 5-7, in West Hartford, CT.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/02/14/the-missing-link-with-terrier-basketball/">The Missing Link with Terrier Basketball</a> (700 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Trio of Terriers Leads BU to Third Straight Victory</strong></p>
<p>Coming off a stellar offensive game against the University of Hartford, where Corey Lowe and John Holland eclipsed the 30 point mark in the same game for the first time in school history, three BU players scored at least 20 points to lead the Terriers past a struggling UMBC team, 75-63. John Holland led the trio with 25, while Lowe and Jake O&#8217;Brien contributed 20 points apiece to pace BU. Last year, UMBC erased BU&#8217;s hopes for winning the conference tourney, upsetting BU in overtime. However, this year UMBC has struggled to win games, mostly due to having a young and inexperienced team. BU has been marred by a slow starts throughout the season, and this game began no differently.</p>
<p>BU fell behind quickly by seven points and were forced to fight back. BU fueled their comeback from beyond the arc and quickly erased the lead ten minutes into the game; they never looked back once they jumped on top, and only let UMBC cut the lead to six in the second half. Chris De La Rosa and Chauncey Gilliam led the Retrievers with 13 points each, as they saw their record fall to 1-14 (0-4).(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/01/19/terriers-finish-the-second-week-of-conference-play-behind-vermont/">Terriers Finish the Second Week of Conference Play Behind Vermont</a> (552 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coming off a tough trio of games over the holiday season, the Boston<br />
University Terrier basketball team looked to rebound from a two game<br />
losing streak against their America East counterpart New Hampshire<br />
Wildcats. Coach Pat Chambers understood that this game would be vital to<br />
boosting his teams confidence, as BU will have to play seven out of their<br />
next nine games on the road.</p>
<h2>Lowe and DiLiegro Lead Their Teams</h2>
<p>Corey Lowe took matters in his own hands and single-handedly led his team to victory 60-56. Lowe, who struggled mightily with his shooting against Stony Brook (3-16 effort), poured in almost 50% of BU&#8217;s points, including three bombs from beyond the arc. Corey finished the game with four rebounds and a pair each of assists and steals to go along with his 28 points. John Holland and Carlos Strong also notched double figure scoring efforts.
