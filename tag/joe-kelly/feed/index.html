The heralded ace David Price has been good this season with a 7-3 record and 91 strikeouts, but his 4.63 ERA leaves plenty of room for improvement. Then there is Steven Wright, who has unexpectedly taken over the second spot in the rotation through his stellar consistency. The knuckle ball profile fits more in the middle to back end of a pitching staff, but Wright&#8217;s impressive performance and lack of a viable alternative have propelled him to the front in the rotation.</p>
<p>Rick Porcello follows Wright in the rotation. The twenty-seven year old had an exciting start to the season but has since seen his ERA creep over four in June, which lends itself to some concerns. The return of Eduardo Rodriguez is a welcome addition and can help boost the rotation if he performs, but doubts about the overall quality and depth of the pitching staff are imminent.</p>
<p>After Price there are some critical questions that need to be addressed, and it begins with Steven Wright. Is he really a top two starter for a potential division winner? There is no doubt he has been outstanding this year, the most consistent pitcher on the team, but the unreliable nature of the knuckleball is a tad concerning. It would behoove the Red Sox to see an emergence from either Porcello or Rodriguez as consistent performance from one of these two traditional pitchers would help stabilize the top of the rotation and ease any excessive expectations of Steven Wright.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with the rotation is the vacancy left by disastrous seasons from both Clay Buchholz and Joe Kelly. Buchholz has the potential to rebound from his demotion to the bullpen if he can find his command, but Kelly on the other hand is a lost cause. Even worse, in his last start with Pawtucket Kelly left the game after four and two thirds innings with an apparent groin injury.</p>
<p>Thanks to the friendly nature of the Red Sox schedule until mid June, John Farrell announced that he will employ a four man rotation until June 18th. At that point he wants someone to grab the role of fifth starter and demand that spot through their performance. This offers an opportunity not only to the incumbents Buchholz and Kelly, but also Henry Owens and Roenis Elias whom have both spent most of the season in Pawtucket.</p>
<p>If these problems with the pitching staff are not addressed from within the organization the front office will have to make a trade. This is potentially problematic because the market for quality pitching at this season&#8217;s trade deadline appears minimal. The two top options are Sonny Gray of the Oakland Athletics and the Atlanta Braves&#8217; Julio Teheran, both of whom will demand a healthy package of top prospects in return.</p>
<p>In an ideal world the team will find a resolution from within the organization, but earlier this week Dave Dombrowski announced he is looking for both starting and relief pitching help before the August 1st deadline. It remains to be seen how the situation will unfold, but pitching is a key element of success for any baseball team and Red Sox could use some help both in rotation and the bullpen as they prepare for a pennant race and playoff run.</p>

He was expected to settle into Boston&#8217;s rotation and this anticipation had cultivated an anxious hope that he could build on an impressive rookie campaign. That anxiety boiled for over three months after the injury. The Red Sox front office exercised caution with Rodriguez through his rehab program, and then kept him in Pawtucket for five starts before recalling him. On Tuesday night at Camden Yards,  Rodriguez was finally ready for his debut with the Red Sox and he handled the occasion in stride. He threw 89 pitches over the course of six full innings, allowing just two earned on six hits and no walks.</p>
<p>The offense opened the game with back-to-back solo home runs by Mookie Betts and Dustin Pedroia, and by the bottom of the second inning the Red Sox had a five run advantage. Rodriguez did not relinquish that lead. He used his fastball early in counts and then worked in a sharp change-up to strike out three batters.</p>
<p>The essential aspect of Rodriguez outing was that it quieted worries about his velocity that had risen when he did not feature 95 mph heater during his starts in Pawtucket. Against the Orioles, he consistently sat around 92 mph with the fastball but touched 94 mph and as he continues to regain both arm and lower body strength the velocity should continue to return.</p>
<p>The addition of Eduardo Rodriguez to the roster adds a sense of insurance to a pitching staff that has some holes with neither Clay Buchholz nor Joe Kelly having proven himself capable of retiring MLB hitters. Buchholz was the man relegated to the bullpen in response to Rodriguez&#8217;s return and after Kelly&#8217;s disastrous outing last night he was optioned to Pawtucket. which leaves a void in the rotation. It remains to be seen how the Red Sox will fill this vacancy but Rodriguez&#8217;s presence should help take some pressure off of the pitching staff as a unit.</p>
<p>His return also presents a precarious situation for the front office. Rodriguez activation from the disabled list feels like the prize of a trade deadline deal. As the deadline approaches this acquisition will have to effect the front office&#8217;s decision making. While it remains to be seen how this process will unfold but there is no doubt that Rodriguez&#8217;s return addresses an important hole in the rotation.</p>
<p>Rodriguez is regarded as one of the more promising young pitchers in baseball and has plenty of time to develop. A role in the middle of the Red Sox rotation this season will serve to curb the lofty expectations of Red Sox fans as the lefty continues to mature, but few question he has the raw talent of a future ace. The camaraderie in the clubhouse should help Rodriguez hone his craft as he learns from the savvy veterans during the playoff push, and fans can expect him to make a solid contribution as the Red Sox strive to stay atop the competitive AL East.</p>

It was a bit of <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2016_05_27_bosmlb_tormlb_1#game=2016_05_27_bosmlb_tormlb_1,game_tab=box,game_state=Wrapup">a strange start</a> for Kelly, because while he did struggle, he also showed some encouraging sings that suggest the potential for future success. Kelly lasted 4.2 innings while allowing 5 runs on 9 hits and 3 walks. Kelly did also strike out 8 Blue Jays in his outing, which provides the basis for confusion. The initial reaction is that Kelly allowed too many runs in too short a time frame, but seeing the high strikeout total gives pause for reconsideration.</p>
<p>Kelly&#8217;s return was met with solid optimism, as he had been racking up an impressive strikeout total in Triple-A Pawtucket while on a rehab assignment as well. It is easy to think that a Major League quality pitcher should easily strike out a good number of Triple-A hitters, but that is not a guarantee. It is encouraging to see that Kelly has carried the strikeout ability to the Major League level, because it will allow Kelly to get out of tough situations, especially if he keeps allowing baserunners at a similar rate to his last start.</p>

Neither happened, and yet, the Red Sox offense still managed to score twenty runs in a series in which they took two out of three from the Colorado Rockies.</p>
<p>At 11 games over the .500 mark, Boston can look forward to a 7 game road trip beginning in Toronto for three games, and ending in an extremely important four game showdown against second-place Baltimore. With first place in mind, this is a vital road trip to establish a cushion in the AL East.</p>
<p>Joe Kelly (2-0, 5.28), who shocked a lot of people in his last start (Kelly took a no-hitter into the sixth inning against Cleveland in his first start back from rehab) looks to bump his record to 3-0, after slicing his ERA almost in half last week. Kelly had previously been impressing in Triple-A Pawtucket, but not many could have predicted how in command he would look on the mound. Opposing Kelly, for Toronto, is Aaron Sanchez (4-1, 3.20), who most recently went seven innings in a 9-3 Blue Jays drubbing of the Twins. Sanchez can be expected to go for around six innings, but the Boston bats have silenced more impressive pitchers this season. <strong>Final score: BOS 6, TOR 4</strong></p>

<p>Cleveland has been on fire of late, which makes Kelly&#8217;s performance all that more impressive.  Kelly said his pitching shoulder felt 100 percent yesterday and it definitely showed.  The Red Sox staff had a collective ERA of 5.04 so far in the month of may.  With Price finally coming around (so we hope), the rotation looks a lot stronger.  The Red Sox hitting will have to come back to earth, and with the dog days of summer coming up the rotation will have to step up in the next coming weeks.</p>
<p>Also a big Thank You to Dan Dyrek, he has now saved the careers of, Larry Bird, David Ortiz and now possible Joe Kelly.</p>

Boston got a reality check when it ran into a sputtering Kansas City team, posting only eleven runs over three games. Jackie Bradley Junior extended his hitting streak to 24 games with a solo home run during the second game of a day/night doubleheader, as the Red Sox took the final game of the series, 5-2, and were certainly thankful for a day off yesterday.</p>
<p>Moving forward throughout May, the Red Sox are at home against Cleveland and Colorado, before finishing the month on the road in Toronto and Baltimore.</p>
<p>Tonight, Clay Buchholz (2-3, 6.11), backed by an offense that can be downright superb at times, will take on the winners of four straight. The Indians are sitting at 2.5 games behind the White Sox for first place in the AL Central, and they need a solid series in Fenway to stay relevant. The Indians will send out Corey Kluber (2-5, 4.30), who gave up four earned runs in 5.1 innings the last time he faced Boston, on April 5th (Sox won, 6-2). The Red Sox and Indians split two games in Cleveland (as a third was rained out), after Buchholz gave up five earned runs in 4 innings the next night, on the sixth (Cleveland won, 7-6). These are two mediocre pitchers, both with high ERAs. Who will implode first? <strong>Final score: BOS 9, CLE 6</strong></p>

Boston&#8217;s latest action came in the form of a trade with the Seattle Mariners. The Sox traded lefty starter Wade Miley and Jonathan Aro for reliever Carson Smith and Roenis Elias.</p>
<p>Miley was a fiery competitor who occasionally bumped heads with Red Sox manager John Farrell last season in his first and only season in Boston. The left hander was a solid middle of the rotation starter for Boston going 11-11 with a 4.46 ERA and leading the team in innings pitched with 193 plus in 32 starts. The quality that Boston may miss most about Miley is his durability. He is able to go out and pitch every fifth day for which the same cannot be said for the injury-prone Clay Buchholz and Joe Kelly who are likely to sandwich Rick Porcello with the third and fifth starter spots to open to season. The reason for moving Miley is the need for an upgrade in the bullpen and financially his contract is very reasonable for the Mariners to manage. It is also known that Dombrowski wasn&#8217;t willing to deal the young, hard-throwing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez who pitched well for Boston in his first season in the majors going 10-6 with a 3.85 ERA. It also always seems like Red Sox fans and management alike start every season with the same sentence about Clay Buchholz, &#8220;If he can just stay healthy&#8230;&#8221; which he inevitably does not. However whether the Red Sox are unwilling to let go of the potential 1/3 of a season ace or other teams have lost interest in watching him get scratched night after night Buchholz is staying put in Boston, at least for now. As for the possibility of dealing Porcello, Boston pretty much hitched their wagon to him with a 4-year $82.5 million dollar contract last season and with the way he pitched no one is chomping at the bit there.</p>
<p>Now what did the Red Sox get in return? A 26-year old, right handed, side arm delivery reliever in Carson Smith. The young Smith is considered to have a power arm, hurling a fastball in the 93-95 MPH range with a killer, swing-and-miss slider, especially for righties, and the ability to mix in a changeup. In 70 innings pitched last season with Seattle he was able to produce 92 strikeouts, this exemplifies the kind of stuff he is bringing to the Red Sox bullpen. Smith went 2-5 with 22 holds, 13 saves and a 2.31 ERA in 2015. His roll in the much improved Boston bullpen will likely be a seventh inning set up man with Koji Uehara pitching the eighth and Craig Kimbrel now taking over as the closer. This kind of late inning fire power has been a successful model in recent years. The Royals had great success all season and will be handing out World Series rings with much thanks to their bullpen, the Yankees have also developed a one-two knockout punch in Dellin Betances and Andrew Miller coming out of the pen to finish games.</p>
<p>Sox manager John Farrell had this to say regarding the now weaponized Sox bullpen: &#8220;What&#8217;s clearly different with this group is that it&#8217;s deeper in talent, it&#8217;s deeper in performance, it&#8217;s deeper in the ability to get strikeouts in key spots. We&#8217;ve got the ability to now assign innings to individual guys where they can probably mentally prepare for that inning.&#8221;</p>
<p>An included advantage in the revamped bullpen is depth and flexibility. Smith has been a set up man and closer in the past and could be up to the task if Uehara needed a night off. Uehara has been the Sox closer for the past few seasons if rest for Kimbrel is necessary. Lets also not forget about the hard-throwing Junichi Tazawa who can rotate in for back end relief. It appears a weakness of lasts year&#8217;s Red Sox team may have been turned into a strength in just a few short months this off season.</p>
<p>Boston also acquired Cuban-born, 27-year old Roenis Elias who went 5-8 with a 4.14 ERA in 20 starts last season. The lefty also had two relief appearances. It is unclear at this time what Boston will do with him, it is thought that he could add depth to the starting rotation or compete for a spot in the bullpen. Elias&#8217; ability to get a starting spot may hinge on whether the Red Sox go hard after another starter such as veteran Cliff Lee who stated he plans to pitch in 2016.</p>
<p>Dombrowski and the Red Sox have aggressively taken care of business early and put themselves in great position to sit back and listen to possible trades and opportunities as baseball&#8217;s winter meetings continue in Nashville Tennessee.</p>

This season has included a lot of failure, and a decent amount of success for Kelly, especially recently. <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statsd.aspx?playerid=9761&amp;position=P&amp;type=&amp;gds=2015-08-07&amp;gde=2015-09-15&amp;season=">Kelly’s past eight starts</a> have been encouraging, and provide some hope for success going into 2016. Whether or not Kelly will still have a shot at a rotation spot is debatable, but there is success to build off of. The most important factor of Kelly’s recent stretch of success is consistency, which he has generally lacked for most of his Red Sox career. Since Kelly will not be taking the mound again in 2015, we can take a look at his season as a whole, and the results might be somewhat surprising. I like to hear bad news first so I’m going to start there.</p>
<h2>The Bad</h2>
<p>Basically the first four months of the 2015 season. <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statsd.aspx?playerid=9761&amp;position=P&amp;type=0&amp;gds=2015-04-11&amp;gde=2015-08-01&amp;season=">Kelly’s first 17 starts</a> left him with a 6.11 ERA, 1.54 WHIP, and .284 Average Against. It essentially seemed like every time Kelly pitched, he ended up with as many earned runs allowed as innings pitched, almost always leaving his team trailing. While Kelly maintained decent strikeout (7.54 K/9) and walk (3.36 BB/9) rates, his run prevention was awful at best. Part of that problem was a near-complete lack of command from Kelly. That issue does not really show up in the walk rate, but it was apparent in watching Kelly pitch; he would miss with the first few pitches to fall behind in the count, then leave a pitch over the middle of the plate to get crushed. This kind of performance leads to a high pitch count, exits in the early innings, and a huge burden on the bullpen to finish the game. Kelly would probably like to forget the first two-thirds of the season as much as the Red Sox as a whole.</p>
