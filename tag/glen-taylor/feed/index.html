<p>1. The NCAA Division 1 Men&#8217;s Basketball Tournament will begin tomorrow with all first round games being played Thursday and Friday.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/2008/03/17/sports-of-boston-bracket-challenge/">As I posted before</a>, I made a guarantee that my bracket will be better than anyone that&#8217;s willing to make their bracket public right alongside mine.</li>
<li>I will say that I&#8217;ve already picked one game right (I had Mt. St. Mary&#8217;s winning the play-in game) but it wont count since I&#8217;m closing the brackets on Thursday morning. If you still want to compete, just comment on this post or email me at kcATsportsofbostonDOTcom.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3300421">According to ESPN.com</a>, Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor, often a big defender of Kevin Garnett, said some rare words today about his former star. One columnist remarked that the 16-50 T-Wolves are playing strong down the stretch, but should start losing to get a better draft position. The columnist referred to the tanking that supposedly took place last season, when KG still played in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Taylor dismissed that notion. He couldn&#8217;t disagree more with the columnist. Except, though, when referring to Kevin Garnett:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It was more like KG tanked it. I think the other guys still wanted to play.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>KG&#8217;s agent, Andy Miller, said Taylor&#8217;s comments were &#8220;ridiculous.&#8221; He added:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;KG has never been questioned nor would he ever be questioned by anyone about his effort or desire to win and accomplish team success. During his tenure in Minnesota, nothing was more important to him than bringing a championship to Minnesota.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
