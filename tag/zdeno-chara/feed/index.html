Let me speak for the majority of Bruins fans here when I say that I&#8217;ve been pleasantly surprised thus far since I wasn&#8217;t expecting this team to be as competitive as they are at this point.</p>
<p>My biggest concern entering this season, along with almost everyone who&#8217;s followed the B&#8217;s the past couple years, was their dull defensive group. On paper, they are one of the worst units in the entire NHL but so far, they&#8217;ve managed to not completely sink the teams and fans postseason aspirations. Granted they have had their moments where they look like they&#8217;re fishing for swordfish in their own end, however it hasn&#8217;t been as bad as it could be. Obviously, the white knight in this case has been the expected-unexpected emergence of Brandon Carlo.</p>
<p>The 19 year-old from Colorado Springs has stepped right into the top pairing alongside Zdeno Chara and has done just about everything that has been asked of him at this point. His big 6&#8217;5&#8243; frame knows how to maneuver around the ice and his impressive poise combined with his simple, no-nonsense style of play has absolutely been a welcome addition to the Bruins backend. I will say that he certainly does look his age on the ice at times as he gets thrown around quite a bit and sometimes looks overwhelmed in the D-zone but all that comes down to inexperience and that will improve the more he plays. Basically, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s too much of a stretch to say Carlo has been a huge reason this team has been as successful as they are in the early-goings of the year.</p>
<p>Behind Carlo and the other five defensemen on the ice stands a man that was on the verge of being run out of Boston this fall in Tuukka Rask. However, after amassing one of the best starts of his career this season recording an 11-3-0 record in 14 appearances, it would be foolish to overlook the contributions Rask has made to the B&#8217;s 11-8-0 overall record. To keep it simple, every game Rask hasn&#8217;t started the Bruins have lost, and those games were missing the same feel to it with Rask on the bench. Not only that, but for the most part, Rask has been an imposing presence in the crease making the majority of his saves look very easy. If Tuukka can keep this up he&#8217;s going to be in contention for the Vezina Trophy at the end of the season, alongside my favorite goalie in the league in Carey Price (sarcasm, of course) and could single-handily lead the B&#8217;s to the playoffs for the first time in three seasons.</p>
<p>The last player I&#8217;ve noticed more than any other through 19 games has been David Pastrnak. I&#8217;m glad to be saying this because I really enjoy what Pastrnak has brought to the table since he&#8217;s been on the roster and I think he&#8217;s the true goal scorer the Bruins have missed since trading Tyler Seguin. Leading the team with 10 goals, Pastrnak has looked much more confident in the offensive zone stringing together some nice plays with Patrice Bergeron and Brad Marchand. The one concern I have surrounding his game though is his health. Similar to Carlo, Pastrnak is a young kid still developing muscle and is more at risk to injury because he&#8217;s on the weaker side. It&#8217;s been an issue in the past and it has popped up already this season, so if anything will hold him back this year, it&#8217;ll be the injury bug. Other than that, it&#8217;s clear that his overall game is starting to show improvement as his back-checking alone has improved ten-fold, as well as his defensive game in general, and it&#8217;ll be critical once the big games roll around in February and March.</p>
<p>Like I said, while the B&#8217;s haven&#8217;t been tremendous so far, they also haven&#8217;t looked dreadful. This team really didn&#8217;t have much roster turnover and the new guys on the roster, with the exception of David Backes, are all young players still trying to fill a role so at least to me, it&#8217;s hard to be upset with the results we&#8217;ve gotten so far. As a team, they seem to be a lot more likeable than in years past and I feel like that comes from their tendency, at least until now, to not give up in games. Other than an embarrassing 5-0 loss to the Minnesota Wild on Oct. 25 and two 5-2 losses to the New York Rangers, every game they lost was a back-and-forth game that I felt they had a good chance to win.</p>
<p>Look at their most recent game against the St. Louis Blues, a couple bounces go their way and they more-likely-than-not walk away with a win against a predominantly top Western Conference team. A 3-2 loss at Montreal also comes to mind in this example as the B&#8217;s were the better team in this game, but just couldn&#8217;t muster a goal past Price. This could be the most important aspect to this years team because as we all know, part of the reason they&#8217;ve failed to make the playoffs was their inability to win big games down the stretch. If they are showing some heart now, I can&#8217;t imagine that&#8217;ll disappear once the games become even more important down the line.</p>
<p>When it all boils down to it in April, we&#8217;ll look back on this start and the towering play of Carlo, Rask&#8217;s extraordinary start, the superb play of Pastrnak, and the overall pride this year&#8217;s team possesses and be shocked. Hopefully it&#8217;ll be a positive shock because they didn&#8217;t get a higher seeding in the playoffs, and not a negative shock if they fail to make the postseason, again. Now that would be something I would not be thankful for.</p>

<p>“My contract goes for another three years and I’d like to play until then,” Chara said in a recent interview. “I think we still have a competitive team with some good young players.”(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/06/16/zdeno-chara-not-worried-about-his-age/">Zdeno Chara Not Worried About His Age</a> (339 words)</p>

Hamilton, 21, is a restricted free agent. This means that another NHL team could sign him to an offer sheet and lure him away from Boston. Don Sweeney has a lot of work to do as Boston&#8217;s new General Manager, but getting Hamilton back for the long haul is at the top of the list.</p>
<p>Any team that signs Hamilton to an offer sheet would have a steep price to pay. Not only is Hamilton seeking $6-7 million per year according to reports, but the signing team would also have to give the Bruins a first, second, and third round pick.</p>
<p>Hamilton was the ninth overall selection in the first round of the 2011 draft by the Bruins, using a pick from Toronto that was acquired in the Phil Kessel deal. The two prized pieces of that deal were Tyler Seguin and Hamilton. The Bruins have already lost one and will not want to lose another one.</p>
<p>Hamilton has shown promise that he can be the elite defenseman to replace Zdeno Chara at the top of Boston&#8217;s depth chart. He played in 72 games in 2014-15, registering 10 goals and 32 assists, all of which were increases over the previous season. He was also adept at power play operation. Hamilton was always on Boston&#8217;s top pair of defensemen and when Chara was out injured, Hamilton was elevated to the top of the depth chart.</p>
<p>Although only 21, Hamilton has shown he is the type of player that Boston will want to keep around for the future. Although his price tag will be steep, the Black and Gold are much better of fixing the salary cap by moving another player instead of running the risk of letting Hamilton leave.</p>

<p>So Sweeney has to deal with all of this and deal with all of it soon so he can end the Chiarelli era in Boston and begin an era of his own. There are a few things he has to deal with before anything else.</p>

Despite losing Jarome Iginla and Johnny Boychuk prior to the season to the Avalanche and Islanders, respectively, the Bruins still looked to be a contender.</p>
<p>Expectations took a hit when the Bruins began the season 1-4 while playing a poor brand of hockey. They began to right the ship but then the injury bug hit, Boston lost Zdeno Chara and David Krejci for significant parts of the season. Despite these losses, the Bruins were still putting themselves in position to win games. The problem was they weren’t finishing. A full 60 minute effort was hard to come by and the Bruins seemed like a squad just going through the motions and waiting until the playoffs. Their play against elite competition was troubling also, going 0-4 against Montreal and 0-3 on a key west coast road trip in December.</p>
<p>A strong month on January was followed by a lackluster February that saw the team suffer another west coast losing streak, this time at four games. March was the month that finally quashed any doubts about the Bruins being contenders. Their five game losing streak in the middle of the month that included losses to three playoff teams and the league worst Sabres. Despite having a chance to sneak into the playoffs on the last day of the season, it would have been naïve to think this Bruins team would have made much noise in the postseason.</p>
<p>Several players performed well below expectations this season. The injuries to Chara and Krejci greatly affected their performance while Dennis Seidenberg and Milan Lucic only showed flashes of the players that helped bring Boston to two Cup Finals in three seasons. Gregory Campbell and Daniel Paille were ineffective and have already been informed by the team that they will not be brought back. Chris Kelly was the best player on the team through October, but came back down to Earth offensively while still contributing on defense. Reilly Smith was ineffective throughout the season and did was constantly moved around the lineup.</p>
<p>Loui Eriksson played well as did Carl Soderberg, but at times lacked the necessary physicality. Adam McQuaid was not as effective as years past and Dougie Hamilton played well but was hampered by a late season ribs injury. Patrice Bergeron and Tuukka Rask were stars for the Bruins, but unfortunately Rask had to play in 70 games because his backup, Niklas Svedberg, was woefully ineffective.</p>
<p>Three bright spots for Boston were Patrice Bergeron, David Pastrnak, and Ryan Spooner. Bergeron was an elite player as always and Pastrnak and Spooner joined the team and made heavy contributions after the All-Star break. Both could end up being major pieces of the Bruins moving forward, but the fact that the Bruins relied on two rookies for most of their offensive production was a troubling sign in itself.</p>
<p>The question now is what’s next for the Bruins in their longer than anticipated offseason. The first shoe dropped earlier this week when the team fired General Manager Peter Chiarelli. Chiarelli had been with the team since 2006 and was a major factor in building the rosters that won a Stanley Cup in 2011 and the Eastern Conference in 2013. His struggles this year were too much for the Bruins, however, and they are now looking for his replacement.</p>
<p>The Bruins will not decimate their core, but it is possible one or two longstanding Bruins could be dealt. Soderberg and McQuaid could very well join Campbell and Paille in playing elsewhere next season. Matt Bartkowski, whose tenure with Boston has left much to be desired, will also probably be wearing a different uniform next season. Zdeno Chara and Milan Lucic have been floated as potential trade names and it is possible that one of them gets dealt this offseason. Malcolm Subban, the team’s young goaltending prospect, could also be part of a deal.</p>
<p>The major question now is the fate of Coach Claude Julien. Julien, who has one Stanley Cup ring with the Bruins, will remain as coach for the time being. But a new GM could choose to make a move for a new coach, which would allow Chiarelli and Julien to reunite next season; possibly in Toronto.</p>
<p>In retrospect, the 2014-15 Bruins have no one to blame but themselves for their failure to make the playoffs. Although they were not as talented as Bruins teams from the past five seasons, they still had more than enough talent to make the postseason. One major change along with several minor ones has already been made. It seems only as though there will be more changes coming and next season’s Bruins team could look quite different from this year’s squad. It will be a long offseason in Boston.</p>

<p><strong>October 13, Avalanche at Bruins:</strong> In this Columbus Day contest, the Bruins met old-friend Jarome Iginla for the first time since his departure from Boston. The game was a grind-it-out affair with each team missing some chances as well as looking in a bit of a malaise during the matinee game.
