<p align="left">Many of you may remember Celtics forward <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/players/profile?playerId=3023">Leon Powe</a> as the guy who played a lot down the stretch as the C&#8217;s coasted to the second-worst record in the NBA (24-58). Powe played sparingly from November to February, but his minutes and games played started to pick up in March and especially April, and the C&#8217;s went 9-16 (2-8 in April) to clinch the second-best chance at landing <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/player/profile?playerId=31545">Greg Oden</a> or <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/player/profile?playerId=31579">Kevin Durant</a> in the NBA Draft. Whether it was because of karma for tanking, or just the bad luck the C&#8217;s have had since Len Bias&#8217;s death in 1986, the Celtics landed the fifth pick in the draft, and you all know what happened after that.</p>
<p>Either way, Powe had a surprisingly productive rookie season, even though he was forced into action due to injuries to key players (<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/players/profile?statsId=3253">Paul Pierce</a>, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/players/profile?statsId=3832">Al Jefferson</a>, etc). April was his best month by far as a Celtic, averaging 21.2 minutes, 9.0 points, and 5.9 rebounds per game. Those numbers are kind of inflated, as Powe played primarily in garbage time. It should be noted that in the C&#8217;s two wins in April, Powe played his least amount of minutes (11 and 12 respectively), averaging 6 points and 1 board in those two games.</p>
