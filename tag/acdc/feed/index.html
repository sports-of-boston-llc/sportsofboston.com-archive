(Boston Herald/John Wilcox)" ></a><p>On Tuesday night, Gillette Stadium was home to one of the greatest rock bands to ever grace the earth. AC/DC rolled through Foxboro on their Black Ice World Tour and gave the fans a truly spectacular performance. It was myself and fellow SoB members Chris and KC who took in the sights and sounds of Gillette Stadium on Tuesday and we have a lifetime of memories to show for it.</p>
<p>Opening for AC/DC were two bands. The first was &#8220;The Answer&#8221; which is an Irish metal band. The crowd had not fully gathered yet, so they played to a small number of people. They were not bad, but nothing too exciting.</p>
<p>The second opening act was &#8220;Anvil&#8221;, another heavy metal band. &#8220;Anvil&#8221; has gained popularity as of late due to a recent documentary about them that was released in the U.S. back in April. Due to its success, AC/DC invited them to open on the tour in the U.S. The band played a great set and I can see myself becoming a fan of their music. The only problem with their set was a fat couple blocking our view. They were literally the only two people standing on the entire field (oh, did I mention our seats were on the field?). However, the guy ended up putting on an air guitar clinic and spazzing out which caused us and everyone behind us to make fun of and laugh at him. Oh, I love silver linings.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/07/29/acdc-rocks-gillette-stadium/">AC/DC Rocks Gillette Stadium</a> (406 words)</p>
