<p>The Celtics recently lost out on the Kevin Durant sweepstakes when he opted to sign with the Golden State Warriors on July 4th, but now it looks like Danny Ainge is trying to acquire the other superstar player from OKC and bring him in to the current crop of C&#8217;s players, including newly signed big man Al Horford.</p>
<p>Oklahoma City obviously lost a huge part of their team when Durant left town and with only one year remaining on his contract, Thunder management must figure they should ship Westbrook off now and get something for him, instead of letting him enter free agency next summer where he could potentially leave for nothing.</p>
<p>The C&#8217;s are in prime position to deal for Westbrook because of the plethora of valuable trade-chips they have including young players like Avery Bradley or Marcus Smart, any of the six selections from this years draft, and most notably, the remaining Brooklyn Nets picks that project to be high lottery selections once again.</p>
<p>Adding Westbrook to this Celtics squad would make them the runaway favorites as the one team that could challenge the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference, as well as an instantly more exciting team due to Westbrook&#8217;s electric, sometimes over-the-top, style of play.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is since this will be Westbrook&#8217;s contract year, there is no guarantee he will resign next summer when his deal expires. This could affect the value of a potential trade for Westbrook in which Ainge uses this as leverage so he doesn&#8217;t have to give up as much to get him.</p>
<p>No matter what may happen these next few weeks, the Celtics are clearly showing they aren&#8217;t messing around this offseason and are serious about winning a title within the next few years. Although Westbrook might not put them over the top, they&#8217;ll be much closer to glory than most and will be one fun team to watch next season.</p>

After being up 3-1 in the Western Conference finals, Kevin Durant and the Oklahoma City Thunder collapsed and lost the series to the Warriors. Now Kevin Durant is simply joining the team that he couldn’t beat. Over the last few days he has been taking a lot of criticism about his decision to join a team that won 73 games last year and has been to the NBA finals back to back years. I think he deserves the criticism he’s getting because I feel like he’s taking the easy path to winning a ring. Where’s the competitiveness, where’s the fight to want to come back next year and beat these players that just beat you. Many people have said; “If you can’t beat them, join em. It definitely feels that way now days where these players are joining each other and forming these super teams. The Warriors now have four players that are in the top 15 players in the NBA as of now. Most teams are lucky to have one player on their roster in the top 15.</p>
<p>Oklahoma City fans are very angry about Durant leaving and they have a right to be. The Thunder are the only professional sports team that they have in OKC. They love the Thunder and they had even more love for Kevin Durant. Thunder fans were stunned by his decision, not only because they thought he was loyal to the Thunder but also because it took less money to play for Golden State. Why not be the star of the city, have a great chance to win, and make more money?</p>
<p>As a Celtics fan, I was getting really excited of the idea that he might come to Boston.  The Celtics just signed Al Horford to a max deal, who is good friends with Durant.  The Celtics would be serious contenders if they added Durant to a team with Horford and Isiah Thomas.  The Celtics even sent the great Tom Brady to the meeting with Durant.  Unfortunately, the Celtics weren&#8217;t able to persuade him to the team.</p>
<p>Many people feel like only two teams can win the championship next year; Golden State or Cleveland.The same teams that played in the finals the previous two seasons. I love basketball but it sucks knowing that your team won’t have a chance against these superstar teams. I feel like more of a balance would make basketball more interesting and a better product. For now it looks like we will be seeing Golden State vs. Cleveland come next June.</p>

Tom Brady, the GOAT, was in attendance at the meeting to help Danny Ainge in the recruitment of Durant. Also David Ortiz would have been there to help but he was busy nuking baseballs into the stands at Fenway.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Kevin Durant needs to come to Boston. The Celts just signed All-Star Al Horford to a four year 113 million dollar deal, Isaiah Thomas is our point guard, Brad Stevens is the head coach, and the team is only improving. If Durant signs with Boston, they immediately become a contender for the NBA Finals. This new big three of Thomas, Horford, and Durant would be absurd. Three legitimate elite players on the same team would do some damage next season so it only makes sense for Kevin to play for the Celtics and he has to know that.</p>
<p>One thing I hope Kevin understands is just how praised he will be in Boston. Players in the NBA know that Boston fans are different. We&#8217;re the most passionate fans out there and we are always there supporting our team through the good and the ugly. Al Horford told his Dad that part of the reason he signed with the Celtics is because of the fans. He knows that when he steps foot on the hardwood in the Garden wearing that green jersey, everyone is going to go nuts for him. If Kevin Durant does the same, he will become loved beyond belief in Boston and I know that for a fact. And hey it&#8217;s Boston&#8230;who doesn&#8217;t love it here?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what was said in Durant&#8217;s meeting with the Celtics but I do know one thing. Ainge most definitely told Durant that if he comes to Boston, he will become a Celtic legend, just like he told Isaiah. So please Kevin, make the right and best decision of your life and play for the best basketball franchise ever.</p>

<p>Al Horford has been recruited by Durant to come to OKC for some time now.  So The Celtics acquiring Horford makes the Celtics pitch that much more intriguing.  Horford is a top 20 player in the NBA, and with Isaiah already in green, The Celtics could put serious pressure on The Cavs if Durant is to choose Boston.  The fact that just hours after The meeting with The Celtics, Durant informed The Clippers he would not be signing with them is very interesting.</p>
<p>I am really starting to think that this could actually happen, and if it does, perhaps Brady&#8217;s number 12 should be retired in the rafters at the TD Garden.</p>

Clippers, The Thunder, and yes The Boston Celtics.</p>
<p>Think about this list, a team that just broke the regular season wins record, a team who recently won back to back championships, the best team of the last 10 plus years, a team that has Cp3 and Blake Griffin, and the team that drafted him.  This is the brass of the NBA (besides Cleveland).  Yes, The Celtics are more than likely number 6 on this list, however at least they are on it.  This list does not include the glamour of The Lakers, the bright lights of New York, it doesn&#8217;t include Houston were James Harden resides, and most surprisingly The Washington Wizards (Durant&#8217;s hometown) did not make the cut.</p>
<p>The Celtic&#8217;s just being on this list speaks volumes, this could single-handedly make Boston more intriguing to free agents.   For years Boston has been laying the groundwork to become a destination for free agents, and finally there is a glimmer of hope.  Hope that free agents can see the history of The Celtics, see the banners in the rafters, and see that this team with Brad Stevens has the potential to be a contender in the east.  The Celtics are also the only team that will meet with Durant that has room for 2 max contracts.</p>
<p>Do I think Durant will be in green next season?  No I don&#8217;t. However if the meeting goes well, and Durant signs a one year deal in OKC and tests free agency again in 2017 then I think there is a real chance it could happen.  Durant and his people hear the plan, Ainge executes it and next season Durant entertains the idea of Boston again.  Remember Celtic fans, Ainge started recruiting Kevin Garnett 3 years prior to trading for him.  Could we see history repeat itself?</p>

<p>Then the first 2 picks went off the board and the moment was finally here.  Celtics fans everywhere were expecting Adam Silver to go to the podium and announce a trade.  Then as he stepped up to the podium he said &#8220;And with the number 3 pick The Boston Celtics select Jaylen Brown From The University Of California&#8221;.  Just like that Celtic fans everywhere were deflated (sorry I know that&#8217;s a touchy word around New England).  All this hope has been shot down, and from the reaction of Celtic fans they were not happy.  It was good to see Boston fans boo, Celtic fans don&#8217;t do that often and it really seemed like Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck looked uncomfortable when he was booed off the stage.  Which by the way I don&#8217;t think has ever happened before.</p>
<p>Personally, I like Jaylen Brown as a player.  He&#8217;s versatile, athletic, and can defend other team&#8217;s best player.  The problem is The Celtics have multiple guys on the roster with these same skills.  Brown has to improve his shooting, last season he only shot .294% from the three point line.  Jaylen Brown could be an impact player for The Celtics, and it could be this season.  We won&#8217;t know if this was the right pick until two to three years from now.  After the Celtics didn&#8217;t make a splash with pick number 3, I felt they were going to draft and stash.  The Celtic&#8217;s didn&#8217;t want to be tied up with guaranteed contracts and not be able to do something in free agency, and the only way to draft guys and not have to pay them was to stash them overseas.</p>
<p>The Celtics and more importantly Wyc Grousbeck have really created this monster.  This monster being us Celtics fans that want to win now and are tired of always waiting for next year&#8217;s draft.  We all know Danny is really trying to bring a superstar into Boston, but until that happens don&#8217;t promise us fireworks and then leave us with an unlit firecracker.</p>

There have been rumors of many teams that Durant may have interest in joining including the Celtics, Warriors, Heat, Lakers, Magic, Trail Blazers, Spurs, Mavericks, and possibly returning to the Thunder.</p>
<p>There have also been rumors of Durant&#8217;s agent sending a list to the Celtics of players that Kevin wants if he&#8217;s going to come to Boston. We don&#8217;t know if this is true but I wouldn&#8217;t doubt it. Durant has come so close to the NBA Finals too many times. If he wants to leave the Thunder he needs to know that the players on his new team are legit and will give him a chance to win a championship. We do know that Durant wants a &#8220;Big 3&#8221; type deal with a new team if he decides to leave the Thunder. If he came to Boston he would already have point guard Isaiah Thomas who is starting to look like a superstar in this league. If the Celtics want their chance at landing Durant in Boston they need to acquire another dominant player.</p>
<h2>Other Possible Players for the Celtics</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Al Horford</strong>
<ul>
<li>Dominant big man who can space the floor</li>
<li>Can do a little bit of everything</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Jimmy Butler</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gifted athletically</li>
<li>Very good scorer to the basket</li>
<li>Outstanding defensive player</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Hassan Whiteside</strong>
<ul>
<li>One of the best defensive centers in the NBA</li>
<li>Very good rebounder (averaged 11.8 REB per game last season)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Buddy Hield</strong>
<ul>
<li>Good three point shooter</li>
<li>Hasn&#8217;t established himself yet but could be threat right away in the NBA</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The list goes on.</p>
<p>Who knows what&#8217;s going to happen but from what we&#8217;re hearing, the Celtics seem like they are completely serious about landing some big name players. However many people don&#8217;t see it as a realistic possibility for Durant to come play for Boston. I also bet many people never thought Pierce, Garnett, and Allen would be a thing but look what happened. The trade deadline is about as month away so there could be some big news for Boston this month.</p>
<p>Also I don&#8217;t know how many people saw this but on May 31st at 1:15 AM, Isaiah Thomas tweeted a number 35 with a four leaf clover emoji next to it, but he shortly deleted the tweet after. You can take it however you want but this only made me more confident that Isaiah is luring Durant to come play for Boston.</p>

I don&#8217;t think anyone, including the Warriors, thought that OKC would put up this kind of a fight against the defending world champs. Up three games to one, the Thunder were in the driver&#8217;s seat. Russell Westbrook couldn&#8217;t be stopped and was looking like the best player on the court. Kevin Durant was playing sound, efficient basketball on both ends of the floor, and the supporting cast, particularly Steven Adams, seemed to be making all the little plays that make the difference in a tight series.</p>
<p>But then, Steph Curry happened. Klay Thompson woke up from his coma and dropped 19 in the fourth quarter to force game seven. When you get a great team like the Warriors on their heels, you have to go for the jugular. Can&#8217;t let Steph and Klay hang around long enough to get hot. The role players, including Anderson Varejao, who apparently still plays basketball, and others did their part down the stretch. Oracle was LIT. Steph was crossing anyone who dared to guard him and making it look more effortless than ever. When I think about Steph Curry twenty years from now, this is the game I&#8217;ll remember. The way he, the Thunder, and everyone watching knew the ball was going in the second he came off of the screen.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got to be honest, I was starting to grow tired of all the Golden State love. ESPN constantly shoving them down our throats and social media losing their minds every time Steph hits a three. But the Warriors are just too much fun. One of the all-time great teams in sports and last night showed just what kind of resolve they really have. Can&#8217;t wait to watch them take down King James once again in the finals. I enjoy watching LeBron James lose just as much as I enjoy watching my teams win. If that&#8217;s wrong, then I don&#8217;t want to be right.</p>
<p>PS- Hey KD, you know who doesn&#8217;t play in the Western Conference with the big bad Warriors and Spurs? The Celtics. Just saying&#8230;</p>

<p>Then Jae Crowder ran into the stanchion on a fast break, exited with a high ankle sprain, and hasn&#8217;t played since.</p>
<p>In his absence, the Celtics lost four in a row to the Rockets, Indiana Pacers, Oklahoma City Thunder, and Toronto Raptors before rebounding with wins over the lowly Philadelphia 76ers and the struggling Orlando Magic. Those two wins propelled the Celtics back into the conversation for the third seed, but they are now mired in a playoff seeding slugfest with 11 games left in the regular season, including a season long five game road trip with stops against the Portland Trail Blazers, LA Clippers, and (gulp) Golden State Warriors. That doesn&#8217;t sound like much of a silver lining (even if Crowder will travel with the team).</p>
<p>But looking at the Celtics through a slightly different lens, isn&#8217;t Crowder&#8217;s injury a blessing in disguise?(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2016/03/23/jae-crowder-injury-celtics-blessing-in-disguise/">Is Jae Crowder&#8217;s Injury a Blessing in Disguise for the Celtics?</a> (790 words)</p>
