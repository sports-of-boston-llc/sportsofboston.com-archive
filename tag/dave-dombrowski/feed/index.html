Andrew Miller was a huge factor coming out of the bullpen this series, most of the time leaving The Sox batters swinging at air.  Ben Cherington is the vice president of baseball operations in Toronto.  So basically, Francona and Miller are playing against Cherington, winner plays Theo Epstein and Jon Lester in the World Series.  Jeesh, imagine having all these guys in the same organization.  Oh wait they were, and the ownership screwed it up.</p>
<p>Dave Dombrowski doesn&#8217;t get a pass on this season either.  Aaron Hill, Fernando Abad, Brad Ziegler, and Drew Pomeranz were Dombrowski&#8217;s moves at the deadline.  These guys were a non factor, except for Pomeranz who gave up a 2 run BOMB to Coco Crisp, essentially losing the game.  How about David Price&#8217;s deal?  He got a 7 year, $217 million dollar deal from Dombroski, a deal that will ultimately end up being a failure, if it&#8217;s not already.  For a guy that was supposed to come in and turn things around, Dombrowski has been a letdown as president of baseball operations thus far.</p>
<p>Winning the series at Fenway last night meant a lot to Terry Francona, you could tell by the way he was reacting on the field.  He knows when he was fired that ownership was stirring up rumors about him, and last night he left with the last laugh.  I&#8217;m sure Jon Lester was laughing somewhere too, remember that horrible offer The Sox gave him?  4 years for $70 million?  Then they turn around and give Price 7 years for $217 million, what a joke.  You know what you had in Lester, he could handle the Boston spotlight and he could win in the playoffs.  Two things that David Price can not do.</p>
<p>This team needs a shake up and ownership has to provide it, and as of now it seems like it&#8217;s not going to happen.  Dombrowski just announced Farrell will be back next season.</p>
<p>Ortiz retired and Farrell coming back.  Just doesn&#8217;t seem right.</p>

<p>The blast was number 526 for David, who was recently placed at number 78 on ESPN&#8217;s list of greatest baseball players of all time.</p>
<p>Consider last night just another day in the office in this man&#8217;s fabled baseball career. He owns this city, just as Tom Brady owns the NFL. So, does Dave Dombrowski have a case to bring back Big Papi for 2017? A few months ago, the answer would undoubtedly have been no, but with the second half of the season well underway, there has been some indecisiveness. Nothing definitive has been said regarding one more year for the 40 year old, but there is an air of hope for the Fenway faithful.</p>

Coming out of the break, Sox fans (including myself) were hopeful that David Price had figured out the source of his struggles throughout the first half of the year. Unfortunately, it was much of the same for Price and the Sox last night in the Bronx.</p>
<p>Like so many times this season, the big lefty looked sharp in the opening frames. His velocity was excellent, painting the black with a fastball touching 96 mph early and often. That, combined with his ability to mix in his breaking ball saw Price making quick work of the Yankees 19th ranked lineup through the first three innings. But, much like it has SO many times this season, one big inning ultimately did in the Red Sox &#8220;ace&#8221;.</p>
<p>So often this year, Price&#8217;s nemesis has been the long ball. While he didn&#8217;t allow a yabo last night, (a small miracle) he did surrender five hits in the fourth inning that resulted in three Yankee runs. Combine that with an excellent performance from Tanaka and the great Yankee bullpen, and that was all she wrote for the Sox and their six game winning streak.</p>
<p>Watching a pitcher with Price&#8217;s track record and ability struggle so mightily this season has been nothing short of perplexing. Mowing down lineups for years with the Rays, Jays, and Tigers, no one could have envisioned him sitting on an ERA of 4.36 twenty starts into his Red Sox career. Here&#8217;s hoping he can right the ship before the Sox and their playoff hopes disappear in the heat of the summer.</p>

Last night (or early this morning) the Red Sox acquired 36 year old righty Brad Ziegler from Arizona for prospects Jose Almonte and Luis Alejandro Basabe. Ziegler will immediately help to stabilize a bullpen that has been teetering on the brink of implosion for months. Koji Uehara, while certainly effective at various times throughout the year, has been something of a &#8220;choose your own adventure&#8221; on the bump this season. You never know if you&#8217;re getting the dominant Koji we remember from 2013 who helped lead the Sox to a World Series title, or if you&#8217;re getting the guy we saw last night, giving up monster yabos to a less-than-stellar Rays lineup and nearly blowing a game that the Sox seemed to have in the bag. Junichi Tazawa, who has been an extremely valuable bullpen piece for the Sox over the past several seasons, has completely fallen off the rails this year. His ERA has ballooned since a solid start to the season, and he simply can no longer be relied upon in high leverage situations. Add in the fact that Carson Smith was lost earlier this year to Tommy John, and you begin to see why this move was imminent.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Ziegler will help to spell Sox closer Craig Kimbrel, who has been dealing with some knee soreness in recent weeks. While Kimbrel certainly hasn&#8217;t been the dominant closer we all expected coming over from Atlanta in the offseason, he&#8217;s still the best relief pitcher on this staff by a wide margin. Dave Dombrowski didn&#8217;t bring Brad Ziegler in to take Craig Kimbrel&#8217;s job. The move is more of an &#8220;insurance policy&#8221; of sorts. Ziegler does an excellent job of pitching to contact, and he is a veteran reliever who is comfortable pitching in almost any situation. One of the biggest knocks on Kimbrel this year has been his inability to perform in non-save situations. Ziegler should help to remedy that issue, in addition to taking over the eighth inning role for Koji.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">What really gets me excited about the Sox recent acquisitions is the idea that Red Sox front office is gearing up for bigger, better moves as the trade deadline draws closer. Getting a guy like Aaron Hill, who has been a terrific hitter at Fenway throughout his career (.308) to play third against lefties and give Pedroia the occasional day off at second was the first of what feels like many moves on the horizon for Dave Dombrowski and the Sox. Then Ziegler today, instantly fills another void.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">In order to make the &#8220;big splashes&#8221; on the trade market, a savvy GM  first must take care of the leaks and crevices. Getting a big name pitcher the likes of Jose Fernandez of Chris Sale is of no value to the Sox if their bullpen is just going to give up the lead in the 7th or 8th. It&#8217;s now clear that the Sox are in it for the long haul, and that Dave Dombrowski has a few more tricks up his sleeve before the August 1st deadline.</p>

During that span, the Orioles have opened a 5.5 game lead over the once first place Boston Red Sox, and the Blue Jays have suddenly found an identity (and are currently tied with the Sox for second place). Obviously, this does not bode well for Boston, and the excitement at the beginning of the season is now slowly being replaced with a feeling of dread.</p>
<p>One bit of good news for the Red Sox is that they are tied for first place in the AL Wild Card race. The Royals and Astros are both only a half game behind, however.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to July, the Sox will kick off the month by taking on the Angels in Boston for a three game set, followed by a four game series against the Rangers. The Red Sox will look to build momentum against a sinking Los Angeles team before doing battle against Texas.</p>
<p>At the moment, the LA Angels sit at 32-47, and are in last place in the AL West. This is a series the Red Sox will be looking to sweep, and hopefully gain some ground on both the Wild Card race and the AL East race.</p>
<p>To finish out the month, the Red Sox will play Tampa Bay (at home, 3 games), the Yankees (away, 3 games), San Francisco (home, 2 games), Minnesota (home, 4 games), Detroit (home, 3 games) and the Angels again (away, 4 games).</p>
<p>The Red Sox will willingly accept a seemingly easier month, as they play four teams that currently sit at .500 or below.</p>
<p>Dave Dombrowski is expected to be active at the trade deadline, and will hopefully acquire starting pitching that will propel the Red Sox to the postseason, one way or another. Price, who has had nothing short of a roller-coaster of a season thus far, has stated to the media that he knows he can play at a higher level, and most expect him to rebound in a good way in the second half of the season.</p>
<p>If the Red Sox can figure out starting pitching, and can come away with a good record in the month of July, they should once again find themselves near the top of their division. Keep in mind that the Red Sox still lead the majors in runs scored (434), batting average (.286), and on-base percentage (.354). They also have several players who are leading in All-Star polling at their respective positions (Ortiz, Bogaerts, JBJ, and Betts). This team can rebound, and quickly. It is not yet time to panic in Boston, but it is a good time to remember how long the Major League Baseball season is.</p>

It might be easy to say that it&#8217;s not surprising that Buchholz struggled against a Rangers team with the best record in the American League, especially with how Buchholz&#8217;s season has gone this year. But John Farrell used his faith in Buchholz to justify not bringing up a reliever from Pawtucket a night after <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8185&amp;position=P">Steven Wright</a> did not make it out of the fifth inning, and two nights after <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=3184&amp;position=P">David Price</a> didn&#8217;t make it out of the third. Most Red Sox fans already knew that faith was misguided, and were not surprised when Buchholz allowed the first six batters he faced to reach base, putting giving the Rangers an immediate lead they would not give up. Buchholz also walked more batters (5) than he struck out (3), further illustrating why he was demoted to the bullpen earlier in the season. Sadly the Red Sox find themselves thin on options as far as starting pitching is concerned, but there really is no reason to send Buchholz back out for another start. He has had more than his fair share of chances in Boston, and he has proven that the only thing he can be counted on to do is under-perform.</p>
<p>A few more notes from Sunday&#8217;s game:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=10607&amp;position=OF">Bryce Brentz</a> went 2-for-3 with a solo homer, the first of his Major League career. It will be interesting to see if the Red Sox try to get Brentz some playing time in Left Field going forward, as his bat could be starting to heat up. His main competition in Left, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=10700&amp;position=OF">Ryan LaMarre</a>, has done absolutely nothing with the bat since coming up from Pawtucket, so there should be plenty of playing time available for whoever is performing at the moment.</li>

<p>Instead of Clay Buchholz returning from his relegation to the bullpen, John Farrell announced on Wednesday that Roenis Elias will greet the Mariners, his former team, for the opener of a three game series tonight at Fenway Park. Farrell attributed his choice of Elias, at least in part, to the potent left-handed sluggers in the Mariners lineup, most notably Robinson Cano and Kyle Seager.</p>
<p>Elias, 27, was acquired last off season in the trade that sent Wade Miley and Jonathan Aro to the Mariners in exchange for Elias and Carson Smith. At the time the deal looked like a steal for the Red Sox, but with Elias in Pawtucket and Smith having undergone Tommy John, Miley sounds pretty good as an inning eater in the back of the rotation. Instead it is time for Elias to step up.</p>
<p>Elias successfully made the harrowing voyage from Cuba to the U.S. in 2010, and in the following year began his career playing in rookie league for the Seattle Mariners before working his way up the minor league ranks to Double-A by the end of 2013. The next year Elias made the big league roster out of spring training as the Mariners fourth starter. That season he pitched to the tune of a 3.85 ERA in twenty nine starts before the Mariners shut him down in mid-September with an elbow strain. In 2015, Elias bounced between Seattle and their Triple-A affiliate, Tacoma, posting a 4.14 ERA in twenty two appearances for the big league team.</p>
<p>In a recent interview Dave Dombrowski noted that out of spring training they wanted Elias to find one consistent release point for his curveball. Instead of employing a breaking ball from three or four different arms spots, the Red Sox asked him to find the best one and throw it on a consistent basis in an attempt to refine his command.</p>
<p>This season on the east coast is a change for scenery for Elias,and he has pitched well for Pawtucket. In ten games, nine starts, he has a 3.54 ERA and 8.85 K/9, and in his last five starts he has been particularly sharp. He has focused on finding a consistent breaking ball this season with the PawSox and will need to use this pitch effectively tonight if he wants to keep the potent Mariners offense off balance.</p>
<p>Roenis Elias is presented with a great chance to prove himself tonight at Fenway and, given the state of the Red Sox rotation right now, can earn himself another start if he pitches well. The Red Sox pitching staff is club&#8217;s biggest weakness right now, and an emergence from this Cuban south paw would help the team immensely as Dombrowski tries to patch together a reliable rotation before the August 1st trade deadline.</p>

The heralded ace David Price has been good this season with a 7-3 record and 91 strikeouts, but his 4.63 ERA leaves plenty of room for improvement. Then there is Steven Wright, who has unexpectedly taken over the second spot in the rotation through his stellar consistency. The knuckle ball profile fits more in the middle to back end of a pitching staff, but Wright&#8217;s impressive performance and lack of a viable alternative have propelled him to the front in the rotation.</p>
<p>Rick Porcello follows Wright in the rotation. The twenty-seven year old had an exciting start to the season but has since seen his ERA creep over four in June, which lends itself to some concerns. The return of Eduardo Rodriguez is a welcome addition and can help boost the rotation if he performs, but doubts about the overall quality and depth of the pitching staff are imminent.</p>
<p>After Price there are some critical questions that need to be addressed, and it begins with Steven Wright. Is he really a top two starter for a potential division winner? There is no doubt he has been outstanding this year, the most consistent pitcher on the team, but the unreliable nature of the knuckleball is a tad concerning. It would behoove the Red Sox to see an emergence from either Porcello or Rodriguez as consistent performance from one of these two traditional pitchers would help stabilize the top of the rotation and ease any excessive expectations of Steven Wright.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with the rotation is the vacancy left by disastrous seasons from both Clay Buchholz and Joe Kelly. Buchholz has the potential to rebound from his demotion to the bullpen if he can find his command, but Kelly on the other hand is a lost cause. Even worse, in his last start with Pawtucket Kelly left the game after four and two thirds innings with an apparent groin injury.</p>
<p>Thanks to the friendly nature of the Red Sox schedule until mid June, John Farrell announced that he will employ a four man rotation until June 18th. At that point he wants someone to grab the role of fifth starter and demand that spot through their performance. This offers an opportunity not only to the incumbents Buchholz and Kelly, but also Henry Owens and Roenis Elias whom have both spent most of the season in Pawtucket.</p>
<p>If these problems with the pitching staff are not addressed from within the organization the front office will have to make a trade. This is potentially problematic because the market for quality pitching at this season&#8217;s trade deadline appears minimal. The two top options are Sonny Gray of the Oakland Athletics and the Atlanta Braves&#8217; Julio Teheran, both of whom will demand a healthy package of top prospects in return.</p>
<p>In an ideal world the team will find a resolution from within the organization, but earlier this week Dave Dombrowski announced he is looking for both starting and relief pitching help before the August 1st deadline. It remains to be seen how the situation will unfold, but pitching is a key element of success for any baseball team and Red Sox could use some help both in rotation and the bullpen as they prepare for a pennant race and playoff run.</p>

<p><strong>Starting PItching</strong></p>
<p>The Red Sox can obviously use some help in the starting rotation.  With Eduardo Rodriguez scheduled to make his first start this tuesday, he&#8217;s not the guy you want to pencil in as the number 2 in this rotation.  Here&#8217;s a few guys The Sox should go after.</p>
<p>Justin Verlander:</p>
<p>Verlander is 4-4 on the season with an era of 4.02.  He has been there before in the playoffs, and is a guy that can be trusted.  However he is 33 years old and his contract is ridiculous.  He is making 28 million dollars this season and the following 3 seasons, then in 2020 he will be making 22 million.  This is a lot of money to be dishing out for a 33-year-old.  However, don&#8217;t forget that Dombrowski is the guy that gave him this money.  Plus the Red Sox have their own bad contract in Pablo Sandoval, if the two teams can work something out we&#8217;re both sides eat money on their respective guys then this trade is completely possible.</p>
<p>Sonny Gray:</p>
<p>Gray is 3-5 on the season with an era of 6.19, however he is a much better than his stats show.  He is only 26 years old and would likely be a rental.  His contract this year is only for 512k and is available for arbitration for the next 3 seasons.</p>
<p>Julio Teheran:</p>
<p>Teheran is 1-4 on the season, however his era is 2.45.  Pitching for Atlanta Teheran doesn&#8217;t get any run support.  Teheran is known as one of the best young pitchers in baseball and will be a trade target for multiple teams at the trade deadline.</p>
<p>The Sox are also in need for end of the bullpen help, tho relief pitchers are difficult to foresee who will be available at the deadline.  All and all it is a definite that Dombrowski will make a move at the deadline, and I&#8217;m sure it will be a big move.</p>

<p>One day after David Price struck out 10 batters to show why the Red Sox signed him as the new ace and face of the pitching staff, Clay Buchholz surrendered five earned runs over four laborious innings. If anyone personifies the giant question mark that is the backend of the rotation after Price, it is Buchholz.</p>
