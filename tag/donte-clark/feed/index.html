Let&#8217;s throw out the loss to St. Bonaventure and concentrate on everything else that has happened since the season&#8217;s low point.</p>
<p>On December 20, UMass hit the road to finish off the New England portion of its non-conference schedule against the Providence Friars, a team they defeated in a thriller at the Mullins Center a season ago.

Being able to rebound after a loss is a big factor in having a successful season and UMass has shown that ability both during and in between games. Here&#8217;s a look at how the Minutemen have been able to jump right back into the thick of things without missing a beat.</p>
