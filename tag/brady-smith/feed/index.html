				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to the <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/news/regional/general/view.bg?articleid=1088345">Boston Herald</a>, Boston College&#8217;s star defensive end, Brady Smith, was charged with sexual assault and breaking and entering that occurred early Saturday morning. The 20-year-old junior started 12 games last year, contributing to the team&#8217;s impressive 11-3 season. He has been issued a summary suspension from the university and has been indefinitely suspended from the Eagles football team. Smith was attending BC on a football scholarship.</p>
<p><strong>My take</strong>: Well, first of all, Smith has not been tried, so in the good old US of A, he is innocent until proven guilty. However, for the sake of this post I&#8217;m going to assume he&#8217;s guilty anyway. I&#8217;m not even going to bother mentioning the fact that sexual assault is bad and disgusting. I&#8217;ll just assume everyone reading this already knows that and agrees. The one thing I can say is that I really hate people like this. I know a lot of really smart people who applied to BC, but didn&#8217;t get in. I know others who did get in, but couldn&#8217;t go because they couldn&#8217;t afford it. It makes me so mad that someone like this is taking the place of smart, productive, non-criminals. I just hope that the same people who handed him a scholarship don&#8217;t hand him a verdict of not guilty.</p>
