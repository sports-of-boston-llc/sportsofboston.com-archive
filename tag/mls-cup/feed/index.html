				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This loss was pretty disappointing. The Revolution took a 1-0 lead early on with Taylor Twellman&#8217;s goal off the cross, but slowly deteriorated defensively. They were overtaken in the second half with two Houston Dynamo goals, losing 2-1. Maybe they were tired; maybe they were rusty. Credit Sports of Boston staffer Jeff, who said that the Revs the MLS-equivalent of the Buffalo Bills. The Bills have never won a Superbowl, but they went to the big game four consecutive years without tasting glory. The Revs have lost the last three MLS Cup games.</p>
<p>It still is nice that Boston teams have played in the last two professional sports championships. The next one coming up is the NFL&#8217;s Superbowl&#8230;will the Patriots be there to make it 3-for-3?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>MLS Cup: New England Revolution vs. Houston Dynamo<br />
Where: RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C.<br />
When: Sunday, November 18, at 12 p.m. EST<br />
What to watch for: <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/soccer/revolution/view.bg?articleid=1045573" target="_blank">Scouting report</a> By Kyle McCarthy, Boston Herald</strong></p>
<p>This is the second straight pro-sports championship with a Boston area team in it. Despite the fact that the Revs are even less popular than the Bruins (though that gap is certainly closing), this is another huge step in the right direction for Boston sports. If the Revs win, it could be 2-for-2 so far for Boston in Pro-Sports Championships for the 2007-2008 seasons. The Revs are no strangers to success (this is their third straight MLS Cup appearance). But, they have never won the big one, losing in heartbreaking fashion the last two times out.</p>
<p>Special Note: According to the Boston Globe&#8217;s Mike Reiss, <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/soccer/articles/2007/11/17/kraft_is_going_for_perfect_attendance/" target="_blank">Owner Robert Kraft will be in attendance</a> for BOTH the MLS Cup and the Patriots-Bills game Sunday night in Buffalo.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boston has already sent their second pro sports team to the Championship game. The New England Revolution won 1-0 Thursday night against the Chicago Fire and will play in their third-consecutive MLS Cup game. With all that success, the Revs still have never won an MLS Cup. Forward Taylor Twellman got them there by scoring the lone goal of the game in the 38th minute on an acrobatic bicycle kick.</p>
<p>The Fire had been on a 10-game (4-0-6) unbeaten streak. The Revs have never lost to the Fire in the playoffs, going 6-0. In fact, they&#8217;ve eliminated Chicago the last three years from postseason play. Now, the team awaits either the Kansas City Wizards or the Houston Dynamo, who beat the Revs last season to win it all.</p>
<p>Can the Revolution become the second Boston-area team to win it all in just three weeks time? Probably the fifth-most popular team in the area, the MLS Cup still bears watching.</p>
<p>MLS Cup: Revolution vs. Dynamo/Wizards<br />
Where: Washington, D.C.<br />
When: November 18</p>
