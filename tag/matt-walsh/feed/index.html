				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just as Spygate seems to be winding down, there&#8217;s new reports of more NFL rules violations by the Patriots. Ross Tucker &#8211; a veteran of seven NFL seasons with five different teams &#8211; has come out and said the Patriots allowed players on injured reserve to practice, which is against NFL rules. </p>
<p>Matt Walsh had originally claimed that the Patriots not only let IR players practice but they did what they could to hide it. </p>
<p>Tucker said before the 2005 season he witnessed first hand the Patriots practice and quotes veteran WR Troy Brown as saying, &#8220;Everybody does it.&#8221;</p>
<p>After Walsh brought up the subject, the NFL said it would investigate.</p>
<p><strong>My Take:</strong> We&#8217;ll see where this goes, but it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if most other teams did this. This is just more dumping on the Patriots and gives ESPN another news cycle to bring up the whole mess.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boston Herald Patriots beat writer John Tomase <a href="http://bostonherald.com/sports/football/patriots/view.bg?articleid=1094427&amp;srvc=sports&amp;position=0" target="_blank">published an account </a>of what led to his writing of <em>The Story</em> in which he reported that the Patriots taped the St. Louis Rams&#8217; walk-through before Super Bowl XXXVI. The story was published the day before the Super Bowl and has been proven false when Matt Walsh divulged that he nor anyone else in the Patriots video staff had done so.</p>
<p>Tomase basically says that he messed up by relying a source (or a &#8216;few&#8217; sources he says) but never could back any of it up with hard evidence. He heard from a source &#8216;he trusted&#8217; that the Patriots had filmed the walk-through but Tomase never saw a tape or talked to anyone who saw a tape. He states in today&#8217;s article that at the time of publishing he was convinced his story was accurate but as time went on and more information came out about the walk-through he began to question the validity of story.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to the AP,<strong> Sen. Arlen Specter</strong> wants an independent investigation of the Patriots&#8217; taping of opposing coaches&#8217; signals similar to the Mitchell Report on performance enhancing drugs in baseball. Specter again criticized the league&#8217;s handling of the investigation during a news conference Wednesday. Specter is the senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong>OK. I&#8217;ve had enough of this national attention to the issue. Allow me to give some local attention. Here are the facts that were presented to NFL Commissioner <strong>Roger Goodell</strong> by <strong>Bill Belichick</strong> and reaffirmed by <strong>Matt Walsh</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Patriots illegally taped opposing offensive and defensive signals from the sidelines ever since Bill Belichick became coach in 2000.</li>
<li>The Patriots did not tape or authorize a taping of the St. Louis Rams&#8217; walkthrough prior to the 2002 Super Bowl.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Boston Herald <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/football/patriots/view.bg?articleid=1093898&amp;srvc=home&amp;position=0">has officially apologized</a> for its errant report by <strong>John Tomase</strong> that the Patriots taped the Rams&#8217; walkthrough prior to their first Super Bowl victory.</p>
<blockquote><p>On Feb. 2, 2008, the Boston Herald reported that a member of the New England Patriots’ video staff taped the St. Louis Rams’ walkthrough on the day before Super Bowl XXXVI. While the Boston Herald based its Feb. 2, 2008, report on sources that it believed to be credible, we now know that this report was false, and that no tape of the walkthrough ever existed.</p>
<p>Prior to the publication of its Feb. 2, 2008, article, the Boston Herald neither possessed nor viewed a tape of the Rams’ walkthrough before Super Bowl XXXVI, nor did we speak to anyone who had. We should not have published the allegation in the absence of firmer verification.</p>
<p>The Boston Herald regrets the damage done to the team by publication of the allegation, and sincerely apologizes to its readers and to the New England Patriots’ owners, players, employees and fans for our error.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NFL Commish Roger Goodell and Matt Walsh have finished their meeting in New York to discuss Walsh&#8217;s part in SpyGate. With no Rams walkthrough tape in hand, it seems Walsh has no real smoking gun to give Goodell and today&#8217;s testimony may not mean much. Walsh has handed over all the videotapes from his &#8220;collection&#8221; and the NFL had released a statement saying basically that there was nothing new there.</p>
<p>Walsh will now meet with Pennsylvania U.S. Senator Arlen Specter later today in Washington to discuss the matter further.</p>
<p>Big news from press conference is that Goodell has acknowledged that Walsh has no knowledge of a Rams tape, was never asked to do it and had no knowledge that anyone had been asked to do it.</p>
<p>Also Walsh said he wasn&#8217;t aware of any other violation of NFL rules, including bugging of locker rooms and manipulation of recording equipment. </p>
<p>Goodell said (paraphrasing) that, &#8220;the conversation confirms that the Patriots have given us all the information about league rules they broke and there is no other information suggesting the Pats have done anything wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>More to come&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Patriots video assistant Matt Walsh has reached an agreement to meet with the NFL to discuss his role, if any, in the Spygate scandal. Walsh and his lawyers had been negotiating with the NFL over terms and protection for him to come forward. Walsh will meet with Commishioner Roger Goodell on May 13.</p>
<p>Walsh claims to have knowledge and maybe tapes from his time with the Patriots, which ended in 2003. Team owner Robert Kraft and head coach Bill Belichick have flatly denied that Walsh has any information or tapes which would further incriminate the Pats.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Patriots video assistant Matt Walsh is closing in on a deal with the NFL where he would hand over supposed tapes full of evidence against the Patriots. Walsh had been asking for full protection from the league, probably because he has the tapes illegally.</p>
<p>Walsh was fired in 2003 for allegedly recording phone conversations without consent of the other party.</p>
<p><strong>My Take:</strong> I hope the deal gets done so he can come forward with whatever he has and we can be done with it. I still believe he doesn&#8217;t have anything significant and that even if he does, the Patriots will simply deny they told him to do it. At least with the Walsh tapes out in the open, we&#8217;ll know everything there is to know about SpyGate.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Patriots video assistant Matt Walsh has received the legal protection he desired and may now talk to the NFL about his time with the Patriots and any shady dealings he was involved with. ESPN reported last night that NFL Commish Roger Goodell has told Walsh the NFL would protect him legally from any suits against the Patriots both criminal and civil if he would disclose what, if any, evidence he has on the Patriots.</p>
<p>Last week, Walsh hinted that he may have further information about the Patriots and alleged spying but would only disclose his views if an organization or media outlet would protect him. Walsh signed a confidentiality agreement before leaving the team in 2003.</p>
<p><strong>My Take:</strong> Now we&#8217;ll see if Walsh was bluffing or he really has some dirt on the Pats. If he does have any tapes, he could be charged with theft because they would belong to the Pats. It may simply come down to a he said/he said which won&#8217;t really affect the Patriots. The inner Patriots fan in me doesn&#8217;t like this development because I really fear some tapes being released and the Pats legacy being tarnished permanently, but the inner journalist in me wants to find out what he has to say.</p>
