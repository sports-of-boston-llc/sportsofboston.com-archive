Coming into Thursday only one game ahead of Baltimore, the Red Sox had some pressure on them. What started off as a slow night turned into one to remember. Heading into the bottom of the ninth at Fenway, the Sox were trailing the Yankees five to one.</p>
<p>Note to self: <strong>NEVER LEAVE A SPORTING EVENT EARLY.</strong></p>
<p>The Sox rallied in the ninth as David Ortiz drove a line drive up the middle to put run number two on the board. Next  up, Mookie Betts drives another run in to make it a two run deficit. Then Hanley Ramirez steps to the plate. Dellin Betances throws a handful of breaking balls to Hanley. When the count showed 3-1, Betances reared back and threw a fastball right down the middle. Ramirez connected with the pitch and hit an absolute moonshot three run home run over the center field wall. Hanley knew it was gone right off the bat, as some may say he &#8220;pimped it&#8221; as he walked down the line and held his bat high in the air.</p>
<p>Hanley gracefully trotted around the bases and then was mauled by his teammates at home plate. The home run was Hanley&#8217;s 25th of the year and it also jumped his rbi count to 100. This win was so important with the AL East standings being so close between the Sox, Orioles, and Blue Jays. Boston now sits in first place and two games ahead of Baltimore. Every game in September is an important win as the Sox are nearing the end of the regular season. Boston has three games remaining in their series with the Yankees.</p>
<p>Not only was tonight a night to remember for Hanley, but also for David Ortiz. In the bottom of the eighth inning, Ortiz hit a line drive home run to center field. It was his 34st homer of the season and also the 537th of his career, passing Mickey Mantle on the all time home run list. David now sits at 17th all time. It&#8217;s really going to be something when he leaves the game.</p>

<p>Porcello has probably been the quietest winning pitcher in all of baseball. After Friday night&#8217;s game Rick holds a 20-3 record. Not only is Rick the best pitcher in baseball right now but the Sox are now in first place and two games ahead of Toronto in the AL East.</p>
<p>The Sox have been playing very well lately as they have won seven of their last ten games. It looks like Boston is establishing themselves as a dominant team in this league as their hitting and pitching has really come around as the season is nearing an end. But much of that success is due to the tremendous season Porcello has had so far. He has a great chance to take the AL Cy Young Award this year.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to get my hopes up, but with the post season right around the corner, I cannot wait for what October has in store for Sox Nation.</p>

The powerhouse hitting Red Sox are now in a position where the postseason is not a guarantee. They have been bouncing in and out of first, second, and third place for a majority of the season. The Red Sox, Blue Jays and Orioles have been the most dominant teams in the Al East all season.</p>
<p>Going into Monday Aug. 29th, the Red Sox sit in second place with a 72-58 record, two games behind the Blue Jays. Baltimore sits right behind the Sox, only one game back. So the question we are all wondering is who is going to win the division?</p>
<p>I believe at this point it&#8217;s a complete toss up. We can pull out as many statistics as we want to predict the end of the season results but we have to remember that this is baseball. This game is so unpredictable, especially when there are only 30 games left to be played. Any team could take the division with being just a half game up, it could be that close.</p>
<p>The good news is that the next month of baseball is going to be tough for all teams in the AL East. Starting tonight until the end of the season the Sox have two remaining series against the Rays, Yankees, Orioles, and the Blue Jays. So the standings in the AL East are going to be jumping all around for the next month. If the Sox want a legitimate chance at taking the division, they need to be the best team in the month of September, period.</p>
<p>If the Sox do not win the division, they always have the Wild Card. But with the Wild Card , the top two teams have to play in a one game playoff match up to decide who moves onto the ALDS. Boston needs to avoid this at all costs because a one game deciding match up is a tough game to win. If this were to happen I&#8217;d be scared to see who Farrell decides to start on the bump.</p>
<p>However I am very confident the Sox will finish the season strong. Their hitting is still very dominant. Ortiz is still showing he&#8217;s one of the best with 30 plus homers and 100 plus RBIs. Mookie is still one of the best hitters in the entire MLB right now with 29 homers, 94 RBIs, and a .321 AVG (Did I mention he was a lead off hitter for the majority of the season?). And Pedey quietly is hitting .320 going into Monday. So the bats are there. Again as we&#8217;ve discussed a million times, it all comes down to the Sox pitching. Starting pitching for Boston has looked better lately, the bullpen is still an issue. All we can do at this point is pray that the pitching comes around going into September.</p>
<p>The toughest series the Sox are going to have this next month are the ones against the Blue Jays. Toronto plays as the biggest threat towards Boston. They are a very well rounded team that can hit and have some pitching. The two series the Sox have against them in the next month are definitely the most imports series they will have all year.</p>
<p>This all being said, I&#8217;m super excited for the next month of baseball because its going to be a a fun one to watch.</p>

Neither happened, and yet, the Red Sox offense still managed to score twenty runs in a series in which they took two out of three from the Colorado Rockies.</p>
<p>At 11 games over the .500 mark, Boston can look forward to a 7 game road trip beginning in Toronto for three games, and ending in an extremely important four game showdown against second-place Baltimore. With first place in mind, this is a vital road trip to establish a cushion in the AL East.</p>
<p>Joe Kelly (2-0, 5.28), who shocked a lot of people in his last start (Kelly took a no-hitter into the sixth inning against Cleveland in his first start back from rehab) looks to bump his record to 3-0, after slicing his ERA almost in half last week. Kelly had previously been impressing in Triple-A Pawtucket, but not many could have predicted how in command he would look on the mound. Opposing Kelly, for Toronto, is Aaron Sanchez (4-1, 3.20), who most recently went seven innings in a 9-3 Blue Jays drubbing of the Twins. Sanchez can be expected to go for around six innings, but the Boston bats have silenced more impressive pitchers this season. <strong>Final score: BOS 6, TOR 4</strong></p>

(AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Chris Young)" ></a><p>Tuesday night&#8217;s game against the Toronto Blue Jays started off reasonably well for Mike Napoli, with a first inning single that allowed him to eventually score on a double by Will Middlebrooks.</p>
<p>Then the game took a turn for the worse for the Red Sox first baseman, as he struck out swinging in the third, then was beaned by Blue Jays knuckleballer R.A. Dickey, who uncorked a wild knuckler that <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2014_08_26_bosmlb_tormlb_1&amp;mode=video&amp;content_id=35686271&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_35686271" target="_blank">struck Napoli in the brim of the helmet</a>.</p>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>Napoli would ultimately get his revenge (though he would have to wait until extra innings to do so), when he unloaded on an 0-2 fastball from Toronto reliever Sergio Santos in the 11th inning for a three-run blast that gave the Red Sox a 9-4 lead at the time (good thing, too, as the Blue Jays came back to score three runs in the bottom of the frame). Oh, and did I mention his home run <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2014_08_26_bosmlb_tormlb_1&amp;mode=video" target="_blank">landed in the fifth deck at the Rogers Centre</a>?</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what 451 feet looks like&#8230;</p>
