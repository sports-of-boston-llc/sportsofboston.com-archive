For the 2-0 New England Patriots: <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?playerId=2330">Tom Brady</a>, entering his eleventh season, holder of records, winner of MVPs and Super Bowls alike. For the 1-1 St. Louis Rams: <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?playerId=13197">Sam Bradford</a>, the #1 draft pick from 2010, primed to start his rookie season. Traditionally, the third preseason game of the NFL is the game that best depicts how a team will play in the regular season. If that&#8217;s the case, then many of the questions fans had coming into the game remained unanswered at its conclusion.</p>
<h2>First Quarter</h2>
<p>The game could not have began better for the Patriots. The Rams kicked off to the New England 3-yard line, where it was caught by wide receiver <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?playerId=12597">Brandon Tate</a>. Some good blocking up front, and Tate was off to the races. Tate wound up going 97 yards to the opposing end-zone, easily beating the kicker. A successful point-after-touchdown, and the Patriots were up 7-0 just 12 seconds into the game.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Patriots&#8217; defense did not respond. They gave up two first downs on the run, then a 32-yard Bradford pass to the New England 18. After short runs and passes moved the ball to the Patriots&#8217; 7-yard line, Bradford completed a 5-yard touchdown pass to <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?playerId=13387">Michael Hoomanawanui</a>. The point-after was good, and the game was tied. The defense looked out-of-sync against both the run and the pass.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/08/27/brown-kicks-game-winning-field-goal-as-rams-win-in-foxboro/">Brown Kicks Game-Winning Field Goal as Rams win in Foxboro</a> (1,444 words)</p>

<p>First off it&#8217;s great to see that you&#8217;re recovering extremely fast. I was scared when you were injured during that Texans game in Week 17. The Patriots desperately needed you in the playoffs and unfortunately, we were bounced in the Wild Card round by the Ravens.</p>
<p>Last season you were ridiculous. I mean, 123 receptions! That&#8217;s ludicrous. You have an unbelievable way of getting open and your chemistry with Tom Brady could be the best in football since Peyton and Marvin. Since coming to New England, you have become a fan favorite and one of the best wide receivers in football. It&#8217;s exciting to see you play every week and see how many receptions you will rack up.</p>
<p>So please, don&#8217;t ruin it.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/08/01/a-letter-to-wes-welker/">A Letter to Wes Welker</a> (637 words)</p>

They determine whether an offense must drive 80 yards or 10, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Head coach Bill Belichick has been one to put heavy emphasis on this area.  He has been known in the past to spend much more time in practice on special teams than other coaches.  The emphasis is particularly evident when you look at the fact that he often uses key players on special teams, including <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?playerId=11244">Jerod Mayo</a> last year, and <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?playerId=1257">Mike Vrabel</a> in the past.  This year’s group is still somewhat uncertain, but here is a look at some of the key special-teamers.</p>
<h2>Place-Kicker: Stephen Gostkowski</h2>
<p>The most visible special teams player is often the place-kicker, as he has the most direct effect on the score. Following the departure of fan-favorite <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?playerId=1097">Adam Vinatieri</a>, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?playerId=9704">Stephen Gostkowski</a> was drafted in the fourth round of the 2006 draft and he has not disappointed.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/07/01/patriots-2010-preview-special-teams/">Patriots 2010 Preview: Special Teams</a> (728 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>They worked all season to get to this point. Now, the New England Patriots will have to best a perennial defensive power house in the Baltimore Ravens. It is one of the four rematches from the regular season being played this weekend. The Patriots will hope for a repeat of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/10/04/patriots-outlast-ravens-27-21/">the 27-21 win during Week 4</a>.  Since then, the Ravens have been playing stellar football and hope to spoil New England&#8217;s future playoff plans.</p>
<h2>HOW THEY GOT HERE:</h2>
<p>New England has had a roller coaster season. Half of New England&#8217;s games this season have been decided by a touchdown, including five of their losses. However, they persevered and outlasted the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets to capture the AFC East. Last season, they were 11-5 and missed the playoffs. This season, 10-6 was enough to win the division and earn a home playoff game. The Patriots now welcome the Ravens to Foxboro, a team they are 5-0 against all time.</p>
<p>Baltimore surprised the world last season when they went all the way to the AFC Championship, led by a rookie coach (John Harbaugh) and quarterback (Joe Flacco). They wasted little time this year, starting 3-0 until they ran into the Patriots. Their schedule was a mix of top teams (Colts and Vikings) and bottom dwellers (Browns and Lions), and they finished with a 9-7 record, second in their division to the Bengals. As a wild card team last season, they had no struggles on the road and they are looking to repeat in the new decade.</p>
<h2>WHY NEW ENGLAND WILL WIN:</h2>
<p>There are certain teams that New England does not lose to and one of them is the Ravens. Since the Browns became the Ravens in 1996, the Patriots have gone 5-0 against the birds. However, this will be a first-time matchup in the playoffs. Still, how much of a difference will this game be from the Week 4 tilt? In that matchup, Mark Clayton dropped a would-be first down pass that would have kept a potential game-winning drive alive for the Ravens. It was a game New England should have lost, (their top receiver was Ben Watson with 51 yards and they had no rusher over 25 yards), but in the end, they prevailed. In the end, it&#8217;s not how you win, but that you win.</p>
<p>So, the simple fact that New England has Tom Brady at the helm should be enough. Even <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/01/09/the-playoffs-without-wes-welker/">with Wes Welker down</a>, Brady&#8217;s weapons of Randy Moss, Ben Watson, Julian Edelman, and Kevin Faulk will allow him to spread the ball around and keep New England rolling.</p>
<p>This game also sees the return of Vince Wilfork. The big man on defense will eliminate any holes for Baltimore&#8217;s Ray Rice or Willis McGahee. The Ravens runners are north-to-south guys who run right down the middle and by shutting them down, New England will ruin Baltimore&#8217;s offense. With a quarterback who can control the clock and a defense that can make the other team continue to punt, there is no doubt that the Patriots will win the game.</p>
<h2>WHY BALTIMORE WILL WIN:</h2>
<p>New England might have been team of the decade, but Baltimore was the defense of the decade. They have had the most feared linebacker in recent memory, Ray Lewis. Their secondary is manned by Ed Reed, a man who has a better nose for the ball than most receivers. So, there is a reason why they should be angry. The only talk about defense is how the New York Jets have the best in the league, by far. If that isn&#8217;t enough to get a team fired up, then nothing is. The Ravens have six guys who have two or more interceptions on the season. Ray Lewis is fifth in the league in tackles and leads a pass rush that has collected 32 sacks on the season.</p>
<p>On the other side of the ball, the Ravens have a duel run threat with Ray Rice and Willis McGahee and a quarterback that doesn&#8217;t make many mistakes. No experts out of Baltimore are picking the Ravens to win, which does create an &#8220;us against the world&#8221; mentality. This game will be a statement game for the Ravens, proving they still have a great defense and that last season&#8217;s AFC Championship appearance was no fluke.</p>
<h2>THE X-FACTOR:</h2>
<p>Who will win the wide receiver battle? Derrick Mason was the Ravens leader in receiving yards with 1,028, but Ray Rice was first in receptions with 78 and the team&#8217;s second leading receiver. Todd Heap, Mark Clayton and Kelley Washington have not been the models of perfection. They also are not sure things for Joe Flacco. If New England shuts the running game down, every member of the Ravens receiving corp will have to step up their game, or they will have an early exit from the playoffs.</p>
<p>When you talk about receivers in New England, all talk goes to the loss of Wes Welker. He is done for a while and Randy Moss appears to be injured as well. That leaves Ben Watson as the teams next leading receiver with 404 yards. Moss will be active for the team and hopefully his injury is one of Bill Belichick&#8217;s mind tricks. Edelman and Sam Aiken will see a lot of playing time and Kevin Faulk will see many passes going his way when he&#8217;s in the game.</p>
<p>Not-So-Fun-Fact: Super Bowl XLII hero David Tyree, yes the &#8220;helmet catch guy,&#8221; now plays for the Ravens and is fourth on their depth chart. Do not be surprised if he makes an appearance, if only to be used as a distraction.</p>
<h2>PREDICTION:</h2>
<p>This could be the closest game played during Wild Card Weekend. If New England can not control the Ravens run game, there is no chance they will win. The last time around, the Patriots did not allow a rushing touchdown. If they can repeat that success, then New England advancing in the playoffs is a sure thing. The loss of Wes Welker will be felt this week, but if there was one person who could over come that obstacle, it&#8217;s Tom Brady. The Ravens will throw everything, including the kitchen sink, at the Patriots, but trust in Belichick. He lives for these games. <strong>Patriots 27 &#8211; Ravens 20</strong>.</p>

It&#8217;s weird that New England isn&#8217;t saying they&#8217;re in a rebuilding season.  Many would look at their past dealings, especially trading Richard Seymour for a 2011 first round pick, and say they are easily rebuilding for the future.  Still, by admitting that they are looking into the future, they would have to ignore the present, which would mean saying they are no longer the best team in the league.</p>
<p>They had a chance to protect their NFL record win streak (21 games from 2006-2008), but went for a much-criticized <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/tag/4th-and-2/">4th and 2</a> play, and failed.  Two weeks later, they were completely manhandled by a faster and stronger New Orleans Saints team.  However, it was the loss to the Dolphins in Week 13 that hurt the most.</p>
<p>It was the first time in 50 games that New England dropped back-to-back games.  It was also the first time the Patriots lost a game in December since 2006.  Even more, the loss was the fifth on the road this season, putting them at 1-5 on away from home in 2009 with the only win coming in London against Tampa Bay.  New England has had bad play calling, a horrific defense, and inconsistent play from stud Tom Brady.  Those three things (when going good) are what makes a team &#8220;elite,&#8221; and it seems the Patriots are no longer there.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/12/12/patriots-elite-no-more/">Patriots: Elite No More?</a> (485 words)</p>

<p>There is only one Thursday night game this week to worry about and we are all spared the horror of having to watch the Lions eat up valuable network time. So, without further delay, let&#8217;s get to it.</p>
<h2>Week 13 Sleepers</h2>
<h3>New York (Jets) @ Buffalo</h3>
<h4>Buffalo Bills Defense/Special Teams</h4>
<p>Buffalo&#8217;s defense is responsible for allowing a league-worst 165 rush yds per game. However, the last time these two teams faced, the Bills forced Mark Sanchez to throw five interceptions. As bad as the Bills&#8217; rush defense is, their pass defense gives up less than 200 yds a game and they are 2nd in the NFL with 21 interceptions.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/12/02/week-13-sleepers/">Week 13 Sleepers</a> (998 words)</p>

No elite team gets beat in every facet of the game like New England got beat in New Orleans.</p>
<p>The league&#8217;s elite is reserved now to a trio of superpowers in my mind: the undefeated Colts in the AFC, and the high-powered Saints and hard-nosed Vikings in the NFC.  The Vikes do have one loss on the year, but I can honestly say I feel they are the best team in the league at this point. To those who say the AFC reigns supreme over the NFC&#8230;yeah, those days are long over.</p>
<p>I may have Minnesota ahead of New Orleans in my power rankings, but that doesn&#8217;t diminish what the Saints accomplished in their decisive win over the Pats.  Records were broken, streaks were snapped, and the Patriots defense was embarrassed.  The loss ended a streak of 17 wins over NFC opponents for New England.  It wasn&#8217;t since a loss to the Carolina Panthers in September of 2005 that an NFC squad got the better of the Pats.  Until Monday.

Each team also scored on a deep pass in the quarter (54 yards for Sam Aiken and the Pats, 33 yards for Antonio Bryant and the Buccaneers), and the quarter ended when Darius Butler intercepted Josh Johnson’s hail mary pass.
