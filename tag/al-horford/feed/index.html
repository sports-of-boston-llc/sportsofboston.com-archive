The Celtics are colliding with the defending NBA Champion Cleveland Cavaliers for the Eastern Conference title. After disposing of the both the Indiana Pacers and Toronto Raptors in four straight, the Cavaliers have had time to prepare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Should Head Coach Brad Miller’s charges make it to the conference finals, there will be plenty of NBA expert picks and naysayers saying the Celtics don’t have the horses to match up with Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, Lebron James and company. On the season, the two teams split two games, successfully defending its home court. If either team has an advantage, it lies in the fact Boston holds home court advantage due to its #1 seeding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For all the tipsters who are releasing NBA expert tips naming the Cavaliers as the play, they might want to consult with Boston’s little mighty mite Isaiah Thomas. Even at 5’9”, Thomas has proven to be a nightmare for opposing defenses all year long. Taking everything into consideration, it wouldn’t be a shocker to see Thomas take the league MVP honors over players like Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry (two-time reigning MVP), James Harden and Kawhi Leonard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the regular season, Thomas finished third in the league in scoring with 28.9 PPG on 44.3% shooting from the field, 36.7% from beyond the arc and 87.6% from the charity stripe. No one will soon forget game two of the current series when Thomas and Washington point guard John Wall engaged in an old fashion NBA shootout with Thomas taking the honors with 53 points in a big overtime win. What made the performance all the more impressive was Thomas had given a eulogy for his sister just days before the game. He had also been in the hospital on the day of the game for treatment on the teeth that had been knocked out in the prior game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As current NBA expert picks would indicate, the Celts are going to need other contributions in order to topple James and the red-hot Cavaliers. That help will have to come from </span><a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4240/avery-bradley"><span style="font-weight: 400">Avery Bradley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, who has been feast or famine throughout the playoffs. After averaging only 6 points per game in games 3 and 4 versus the Wizards, Bradley responded with a spectacular performance in game 5. He scored 29 points on 12 of 19 shooting from the field to go along with 6 rebounds and 3 assists. If he performs anywhere near that level against the Cavaliers with center Al Horford controlling the middle, the Celtics would seem more than capable of springing a surprise on the way to the NBA Finals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the conference championships and finals next up on the schedule, now is the time to be </span><a href="http://www.bettingpro.com.au/subcategory/basketball/nba/"><span style="font-weight: 400">looking for NBA expert tips</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.

<p>The Celtics recently lost out on the Kevin Durant sweepstakes when he opted to sign with the Golden State Warriors on July 4th, but now it looks like Danny Ainge is trying to acquire the other superstar player from OKC and bring him in to the current crop of C&#8217;s players, including newly signed big man Al Horford.</p>
<p>Oklahoma City obviously lost a huge part of their team when Durant left town and with only one year remaining on his contract, Thunder management must figure they should ship Westbrook off now and get something for him, instead of letting him enter free agency next summer where he could potentially leave for nothing.</p>
<p>The C&#8217;s are in prime position to deal for Westbrook because of the plethora of valuable trade-chips they have including young players like Avery Bradley or Marcus Smart, any of the six selections from this years draft, and most notably, the remaining Brooklyn Nets picks that project to be high lottery selections once again.</p>
<p>Adding Westbrook to this Celtics squad would make them the runaway favorites as the one team that could challenge the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference, as well as an instantly more exciting team due to Westbrook&#8217;s electric, sometimes over-the-top, style of play.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is since this will be Westbrook&#8217;s contract year, there is no guarantee he will resign next summer when his deal expires. This could affect the value of a potential trade for Westbrook in which Ainge uses this as leverage so he doesn&#8217;t have to give up as much to get him.</p>
<p>No matter what may happen these next few weeks, the Celtics are clearly showing they aren&#8217;t messing around this offseason and are serious about winning a title within the next few years. Although Westbrook might not put them over the top, they&#8217;ll be much closer to glory than most and will be one fun team to watch next season.</p>

It&#8217;s all happening! Everything is awesome! It&#8217;s not a stretch to say that yesterday was the biggest day in the Groesbeck/Ainge/Stevens era in Boston. Danny was finally able to close that elusive big-name free agent, and Wyc was able to make good on his promise of &#8220;fireworks&#8221; that the fan base has been waiting on for what feels like centuries. Sure, $113 million over four years seems like a pretty penny, but with the money being thrown around this offseason and the huge cap increase on the horizon next season, Horford&#8217;s deal is actually somewhat of a bargain.</p>
<p>Horford&#8217;s game will fit seamlessly within the Brad Stevens system. He provides a much needed presence at the rim, and gives the C&#8217;s the go-to fourth quarter scoring option that they were sorely missing in last year&#8217;s playoffs. I cannot WAIT to see Isaiah and Horford running the pick and pop down the throats of the entire Eastern Conference come October.</p>
<p>By no means is Al Horford a perfect player, as evidence by his lackluster performance in the playoffs last season against these Celtics. He struggles defensively at times, particularly on the perimeter defending the pick and roll. The C&#8217;s team approach to defense should help to conceal some of Horford&#8217;s defensive deficiencies over the course of the season.</p>
<p>Hot damn, the Celtics are officially back. They finally landed a big name free-agent for the first time in the history of the franchise, (Go ahead look it up, I&#8217;ll wait) and they got a guy who WANTS to play in Boston. KD or not, this signing was a huge step in the right direction for this franchise. If TB12, Big Papi, and Julian Edleman have anything to do with it, Kevin Durant will be donning Celtic green next season in the city of champions. What a time to be a Celtics fan. What a time to be alive.</p>

Tom Brady, the GOAT, was in attendance at the meeting to help Danny Ainge in the recruitment of Durant. Also David Ortiz would have been there to help but he was busy nuking baseballs into the stands at Fenway.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Kevin Durant needs to come to Boston. The Celts just signed All-Star Al Horford to a four year 113 million dollar deal, Isaiah Thomas is our point guard, Brad Stevens is the head coach, and the team is only improving. If Durant signs with Boston, they immediately become a contender for the NBA Finals. This new big three of Thomas, Horford, and Durant would be absurd. Three legitimate elite players on the same team would do some damage next season so it only makes sense for Kevin to play for the Celtics and he has to know that.</p>
<p>One thing I hope Kevin understands is just how praised he will be in Boston. Players in the NBA know that Boston fans are different. We&#8217;re the most passionate fans out there and we are always there supporting our team through the good and the ugly. Al Horford told his Dad that part of the reason he signed with the Celtics is because of the fans. He knows that when he steps foot on the hardwood in the Garden wearing that green jersey, everyone is going to go nuts for him. If Kevin Durant does the same, he will become loved beyond belief in Boston and I know that for a fact. And hey it&#8217;s Boston&#8230;who doesn&#8217;t love it here?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what was said in Durant&#8217;s meeting with the Celtics but I do know one thing. Ainge most definitely told Durant that if he comes to Boston, he will become a Celtic legend, just like he told Isaiah. So please Kevin, make the right and best decision of your life and play for the best basketball franchise ever.</p>

There have been rumors of many teams that Durant may have interest in joining including the Celtics, Warriors, Heat, Lakers, Magic, Trail Blazers, Spurs, Mavericks, and possibly returning to the Thunder.</p>
<p>There have also been rumors of Durant&#8217;s agent sending a list to the Celtics of players that Kevin wants if he&#8217;s going to come to Boston. We don&#8217;t know if this is true but I wouldn&#8217;t doubt it. Durant has come so close to the NBA Finals too many times. If he wants to leave the Thunder he needs to know that the players on his new team are legit and will give him a chance to win a championship. We do know that Durant wants a &#8220;Big 3&#8221; type deal with a new team if he decides to leave the Thunder. If he came to Boston he would already have point guard Isaiah Thomas who is starting to look like a superstar in this league. If the Celtics want their chance at landing Durant in Boston they need to acquire another dominant player.</p>
<h2>Other Possible Players for the Celtics</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Al Horford</strong>
<ul>
<li>Dominant big man who can space the floor</li>
<li>Can do a little bit of everything</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Jimmy Butler</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gifted athletically</li>
<li>Very good scorer to the basket</li>
<li>Outstanding defensive player</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Hassan Whiteside</strong>
<ul>
<li>One of the best defensive centers in the NBA</li>
<li>Very good rebounder (averaged 11.8 REB per game last season)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Buddy Hield</strong>
<ul>
<li>Good three point shooter</li>
<li>Hasn&#8217;t established himself yet but could be threat right away in the NBA</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The list goes on.</p>
<p>Who knows what&#8217;s going to happen but from what we&#8217;re hearing, the Celtics seem like they are completely serious about landing some big name players. However many people don&#8217;t see it as a realistic possibility for Durant to come play for Boston. I also bet many people never thought Pierce, Garnett, and Allen would be a thing but look what happened. The trade deadline is about as month away so there could be some big news for Boston this month.</p>
<p>Also I don&#8217;t know how many people saw this but on May 31st at 1:15 AM, Isaiah Thomas tweeted a number 35 with a four leaf clover emoji next to it, but he shortly deleted the tweet after. You can take it however you want but this only made me more confident that Isaiah is luring Durant to come play for Boston.</p>

Although the Celtics have been involved in many rumors they have yet to make a deal. This particular option, if completed for both players, would put the Celtics on a win-now path with championship aspiration in the near future.</p>
<p>The positive attributes of Horford are renown around the NBA. He is proven winner, has averaged 14.3 points and 9 rebounds over his career, and would fill the vacancy at the center position that I covered <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2016/01/07/the-celtics-need-a-center/">here</a> last month. This is not a knock on Amir Johnson, I love the way he plays, but Al Horford is a big improvement. He is 29 years old, is a presence on the glass, and can get a bucket in post when his team needs it. He is exactly what the Celtics are lacking. The negative aspect of a trade involving Horford is his contract. This is the final year of his current deal and he is expecting to get a significant salary in free agency this summer. If the Celtics were to pull the trigger on a deal for Horford, Ainge would either have the upmost confidence in the team&#8217;s ability to sign him to a contract extension or be sending a message loud and clear that the goal is to win <em>this </em>year.</p>
<p>Teague is an electric athlete and has shown the ability to both score the basketball and run an offense at the NBA level. The Wake Forest product, now 27 years old, has averaged 11.8 points and 5.1 assists per game over his career, and his current contract is worth $8 million per year for both this season and next. Not a bad deal for a really good point guard. The only problem with his addition to the roster is that he would join an already crowded back court. The guard position does not feel like a pressing need for the Celtics at this point, which makes this rumor puzzling unless the front office plans to completely reconstruct this lineup mid season.</p>
<p>Danny Ainge has shown the guts and willingness to make this type of deal and go all-in for a championship, but has shown patience with player development and &#8216;trusting the process&#8217; with young guys. Is the goal to win a championship this year? If so, then this trade will certainly move the team toward that goal. Also, is the front office that confident in their ability to sign Horford to a contract extension after this season? Another essential consideration when weighing this deal. If not, then a one year window of return is not an optimal return. It all remains to be seen and or now Celtics fans can only wait anxiously. Ainge is a diligent general manager and will surely consider every and any possible option before making a decision. In the meantime, we should continue to foster the hope of a DeMarcus Cousins-Isaiah Thomas reunion in a green and white uniform.</p>
