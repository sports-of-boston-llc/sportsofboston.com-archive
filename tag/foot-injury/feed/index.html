But, the oldest player in the NBA did not have such a happy birthday.</p>
<p>Part of the reason the Celtics were willing to part with Kendrick Perkins at the trade deadline was that they would be able to rely on a healthy Shaq for the stretch run, and maybe a return to the lineup as early is this week. But, it appears Shaq may be out for a little longer than that. While his right Achilles tendon is healing as normal, his right foot injury is still bothering him and he is out indefinitely, <a href="http://www.csnne.com/03/06/11/Shaquille-ONeal-out-indefinitely/landing_celtics.html?blockID=434473&amp;feedID=3352" target="_blank">according to CSNNE.com&#8217;s A. Sherrod Blakely</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;(Shaq) worked out with us the other day&#8230;some of the pain returned,&#8221; said Doc Rivers. &#8220;(Team trainer Ed Lecerte) just said don&#8217;t expect him anytime soon.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>With 21 games to go, the Celtics are three games ahead of the Bulls in the Eastern Conference standings, and even though Shaq has missed 13 straight games, the team is 9-4 during that time.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2011/03/07/unhappy-birthday-shaq-out-indefinitely-with-foot-injury/">Unhappy Birthday: Shaq Out Indefinitely With Foot Injury</a> (49 words)</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>This one will get Rex Ryan excited.</p>
<p>Tom Brady has been playing with a foot injury for much of the season. That much is true. But, sources told WEEI&#8217;s Dennis and Callahan that Brady may have fractured his right foot before or during the game against the Jets, which could explain why he played so poorly.</p>
<p>Well, those sources may have been accurate. <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/extra_points/2011/01/brady_to_have_f.html?p1=News_links" target="_blank">According to Boston.com</a>, Tom Brady will undergo surgery on his foot at Mass. General to &#8220;address a <strong>lingering stress fracture</strong>&#8221; on Thursday (but that could be pushed back to Monday). The operation, which will be performed by team doctor George Theodore, is &#8220;similar to what Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia had last fall for a fractured navicular bone. If the bone heals as expected, without any complications, Brady should be ready for training camp.&#8221;(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2011/01/19/tom-brady-foot-injury-surgery-set-for-thursday/">Tom Brady Foot Injury &#8211; Surgery Set For Thursday</a> (152 words)</p>
