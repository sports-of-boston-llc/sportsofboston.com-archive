Jackie sits comfortably in the number three spot (over 937,000 votes) right behind Mike Trout and Lorenzo Cain. He is expected to be a starter in the All-Star game. Meanwhile Ortiz and Bogaerts both lead the AL with votes in their positions. But these are not the only three Sox players that may make the All-Star game this July.</p>
<h2>Potential Sox Players to Make ASG:</h2>
<ul>
<li>DH David Ortiz</li>
<li>SS Xander Bogaerts</li>
<li>OF Jackie Bradley Jr.</li>
<li>OF Mookie Betts</li>
<li>2B Dustin Pedroia</li>
<li>1B Hanley Ramirez</li>
<li>3B Travis Shaw</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sox have a chance a pretty good chance to bring a decent amount of players to the All-Star game, but it shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise to anyone. The Red Sox are the best hitting team in the MLB. They are first in runs (342), hits (610), doubles (152), total bases (1015), RBIs (329), AVG. (.290), OBP (.355), SLG (.482), and OPS (.837). They lead in almost every major offensive statistic so it wouldn&#8217;t be a shocker if half of the starting lineup ends up All-Stars this season. At one point during the season, six of the nine starting players were batting over .300 which is ridiculous. These guys are proving that they are a dominant force on the offensive side and they are really trying to make a name for themselves this year.</p>
<p>Now their pitching is another story. Everyone knows that Boston&#8217;s weakest part of their game is their pitching. But they do have some solid pitching from David Price, Rick Porcello, and Stephen Wright. If any pitchers from the Sox were going to make the All-Star game, I would have to say it would only be Porcello. He is 7-2 on the season with a 4.04 ERA. But I honestly don&#8217;t think Porcello will make it. If he had another win or two and had a lower ERA then yes he probably would make the team.</p>
<p>This time of year is looking very different from where the Sox were last year. The only player from Boston to make the All-Star game was Brock Holt. Now Holt has been hurt for a while with a concussion so we haven&#8217;t seen him so he&#8217;s out of the question for this year&#8217;s game. But to go from one All-Star to potentially four, five, maybe even six All-Stars in one year is a huge improvement.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how the voting ballots end up and who leads in each category. I want to see our players at the top of the food chain come July. But its up to <strong>YOU</strong> Boston fans to cast your vote and get our boys to the All-Star game. So head on over to MLB.com and vote! You can vote a total of 35 times total and five times a day. If I could vote 35 times a day I would but I also have no life so that&#8217;s just me.</p>
<p>Happy Voting</p>
