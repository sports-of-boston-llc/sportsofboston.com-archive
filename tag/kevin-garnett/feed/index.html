Clippers, The Thunder, and yes The Boston Celtics.</p>
<p>Think about this list, a team that just broke the regular season wins record, a team who recently won back to back championships, the best team of the last 10 plus years, a team that has Cp3 and Blake Griffin, and the team that drafted him.  This is the brass of the NBA (besides Cleveland).  Yes, The Celtics are more than likely number 6 on this list, however at least they are on it.  This list does not include the glamour of The Lakers, the bright lights of New York, it doesn&#8217;t include Houston were James Harden resides, and most surprisingly The Washington Wizards (Durant&#8217;s hometown) did not make the cut.</p>
<p>The Celtic&#8217;s just being on this list speaks volumes, this could single-handedly make Boston more intriguing to free agents.   For years Boston has been laying the groundwork to become a destination for free agents, and finally there is a glimmer of hope.  Hope that free agents can see the history of The Celtics, see the banners in the rafters, and see that this team with Brad Stevens has the potential to be a contender in the east.  The Celtics are also the only team that will meet with Durant that has room for 2 max contracts.</p>
<p>Do I think Durant will be in green next season?  No I don&#8217;t. However if the meeting goes well, and Durant signs a one year deal in OKC and tests free agency again in 2017 then I think there is a real chance it could happen.  Durant and his people hear the plan, Ainge executes it and next season Durant entertains the idea of Boston again.  Remember Celtic fans, Ainge started recruiting Kevin Garnett 3 years prior to trading for him.  Could we see history repeat itself?</p>

This list isn&#8217;t necessarily a list compiled of the greatest players, but rather ones who&#8217;s nicknames fit them like a glove. Here we go.</p>
<p>10.) <strong>Kevin Garnett- </strong>&#8220;The Big Ticket&#8221;</p>
<p>Back in 1995 when Kevin Garnett broke into the league, Minnesota wasn&#8217;t exactly the most sought out destination to take in an NBA game. In fact, before KG arrived, the Timberwolves had never won more than 29 games in a season. Garnett quickly helped to change the fortunes of the franchise, thus earning the &#8220;Big Ticket&#8221; nickname in the process. The young, skinny phenom was the biggest ticket in town, and he was the ONLY reason to come out to a Timberwolves game 90&#8217;s.</p>
<p>9.) <strong>Kobe Bryant- </strong>&#8220;The Black Mamba&#8221;</p>
<p>Only Kobe could give himself his own nickname and actually have it stick. The black mamba is the second largest venomous snake in the world and it is also the fastest. In his prime, Kobe exemplified all the qualities of this deadly reptile. He was cerebral, fast, and could strike at any moment.</p>
<p>8.) <strong>Allen Iverson-</strong> &#8220;The Answer&#8221;</p>
<p>When AI first came into the league in &#8217;96, he surprisingly donned only one tattoo. The tattoo was a bulldog with the words &#8220;The Answer&#8221; etched above it. The number one pick was exactly the answer that basketball fans of a different breed were looking for. He didn&#8217;t conform to the cookie-cutter image that most players were forced to portray in the mid-90&#8217;s, and people either loved him or hated him for it. AI wore baggy clothes, spoke his mind, and constantly walked the line between edgy and insane. He truly was &#8220;The Answer&#8221; for the city of Philadelphia, as he helped to turn the team into a contender and eventually led them to an NBA finals appearance in 2001.</p>
<p>7.) <strong>Dominique Wilkins-</strong> &#8220;The Human Highlight Film&#8221;</p>
<p>Dominique will go down as one of greatest dunkers to ever lace them up, so this nickname fits him to a T. Anytime he stepped foot on a court, you knew that Dominique was going to do something special. He had a way of making a dunk look effortless and violent all in one amazing, jaw-dropping package. &#8220;The Human Highlight Film&#8221; provided us with a reel of dunks and athletic plays that we will be watching for years and years to come.</p>
<p>6.) <strong>Paul Pierce- </strong>&#8220;The Truth&#8221;</p>
<p>I may be showing my bias here, but Paul Pierce and &#8220;The Truth&#8221; nickname just does it for me. I grew up watching Pierce carry the Celtics on his back through the late 90&#8217;s and 2000&#8217;s until KG and Ray finally arrived to help take the load off. He actually earned the nickname from none other than Shaquille O&#8217;Neal after torching the Lakers for 42 points on 13-19 shooting. As Shaq famously said &#8220;My name is Shaquille O&#8217;Neal and Paul Pierce is the motherfucking truth. Quote me on that and don&#8217;t take nothing out. I knew he could play, but I didn&#8217;t know he could play like this. Paul Pierce is The Truth&#8221;.</p>
<p>5.) <strong>Pete Maravich-</strong> &#8220;Pistol Pete&#8221;</p>
<p>Pistol Pete was Steph Curry before Steph Curry. His handle was untouchable, his court vision was unparalleled, and he could shoot the lights out from anywhere on the court. If the three point line existed during Pistol Pete&#8217;s era, we would remember him as the greatest shot maker in the history of the game. When he got going in transition, it was as if he had been shot out of a pistol.</p>
<p>4.) <strong>Karl Malone-</strong> &#8220;The Mailman&#8221;</p>
<p>Karl Malone was know as &#8220;The Mailman&#8221; because he always delivered (except for championships) for his team. He was a rebounding machine, and he and John Stockton were virtually unstoppable in the pick and roll. Growing up I knew two things: The real mailman was going to bring me my SI for Kids every month, and the Karl Malone mailman was going for 20 and 10 every time he stepped on the court.</p>
<p>3.) <strong>Julius Erving-</strong> &#8220;Dr. J&#8221;</p>
<p>Julius Erving was one of the smoothest athletes in the history of sports. Everything about his game seemed so effortless. From his ability to glide down the court it what seemed like three giant steps, to his unreal leaping talent that helped him to glide through the air and throw down some of the most legendary dunks in NBA history. He was known as &#8220;The Doctor&#8221; because his dismantling of opponents was like an operation. He&#8217;d put you under, and before you know it, you&#8217;d wake up and it&#8217;s all over.</p>
<p>2.) <strong>Earvin Johnson-</strong> &#8220;Magic Johnson&#8221;</p>
<p>Earvin Johnson was simply&#8230;magic. Never before had we seen a &#8216;6&#8243;8 point guard who could do literally everything on a basketball court. His height, vision, passing prowess, and basketball IQ helped make him one of the greatest players in NBA history. Much like an audience at a magic show, fans oohed and awed at Magic&#8217;s unreal talents as he led the Showtime Lakers to five championships.</p>
<p>1.) <strong>Glen Davis-</strong> &#8220;Big Baby&#8221;</p>
<p>The reason why Big Baby comes in at number one on this list is because his nickname has become his actual identity. He looks like a big baby, he whines and cries like a big baby, and his play at times is reminiscent of an infant who doesn&#8217;t quite have fully developed motor skills. I remember watching KG berate Big Baby on the bench and bringing him to tears when they both played for the C&#8217;s. Big Baby couldn&#8217;t hold back his tears, and in that moment, he was no longer Glen Davis. He was now Big Baby.</p>

There have been rumors of many teams that Durant may have interest in joining including the Celtics, Warriors, Heat, Lakers, Magic, Trail Blazers, Spurs, Mavericks, and possibly returning to the Thunder.</p>
<p>There have also been rumors of Durant&#8217;s agent sending a list to the Celtics of players that Kevin wants if he&#8217;s going to come to Boston. We don&#8217;t know if this is true but I wouldn&#8217;t doubt it. Durant has come so close to the NBA Finals too many times. If he wants to leave the Thunder he needs to know that the players on his new team are legit and will give him a chance to win a championship. We do know that Durant wants a &#8220;Big 3&#8221; type deal with a new team if he decides to leave the Thunder. If he came to Boston he would already have point guard Isaiah Thomas who is starting to look like a superstar in this league. If the Celtics want their chance at landing Durant in Boston they need to acquire another dominant player.</p>
<h2>Other Possible Players for the Celtics</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Al Horford</strong>
<ul>
<li>Dominant big man who can space the floor</li>
<li>Can do a little bit of everything</li>

</ul>
<p>The list goes on.</p>
<p>Who knows what&#8217;s going to happen but from what we&#8217;re hearing, the Celtics seem like they are completely serious about landing some big name players. However many people don&#8217;t see it as a realistic possibility for Durant to come play for Boston. I also bet many people never thought Pierce, Garnett, and Allen would be a thing but look what happened. The trade deadline is about as month away so there could be some big news for Boston this month.</p>
<p>Also I don&#8217;t know how many people saw this but on May 31st at 1:15 AM, Isaiah Thomas tweeted a number 35 with a four leaf clover emoji next to it, but he shortly deleted the tweet after. You can take it however you want but this only made me more confident that Isaiah is luring Durant to come play for Boston.</p>

(USA Today)" ></a><p>Do you remember those Kevin Garnett commercials after the Boston Celtics won the NBA title in Year One of the Big Three era? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpaMQstYQ9U" target="_blank">&#8220;It&#8217;s all about <i>eighteen</i>.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>The 2015-16 Celtics may not be quite ready to contend for the franchise&#8217;s 18th championship, but Wednesday&#8217;s loss was all about the number 18: the first quarter lead the Celtics held over the Dallas Mavericks before blowing it all in a 106-102 loss at home in the TD Garden.</p>
<p>A blown early lead isn&#8217;t particularly shocking in the NBA, as the tide almost always turns. (The Celtics could hardly be over .500 otherwise.) But what was frustrating was that the 31-13 advantage was just one of many sizable leads the Celtics held throughout the night. They led by 15 after one, 9 at halftime, 8 after three quarters, and another double digit lead early in the fourth. With less than eight minutes to play, Brad Stevens&#8217;s squad was still holding on to a seven point lead.</p>
<p>But alas, all good things must come to an end, and the Mavericks went on a run to take their first lead of the game (!) with 4:31 remaining. Behind Dirk Nowitzki&#8217;s ageless (and game high) 23 points, and Deron Williams&#8217;s improbable resurgence after escaping Brooklyn Nets purgatory, the Mavs surged ahead to a seven point lead of their own late in the game, and it seemed that the tide had irrevocably turned, with no winds to fill the Celtics&#8217; sails.</p>
<p>But these overachieving Celtics, as Stevens has always had them do, scrapped their way back into the game by forcing some timely turnovers, making some big shots, and getting some help from Raymond Felton at the charity stripe. That left the Celtics with the ball in Isaiah Thomas&#8217;s hands, trailing by two with the clock winding down. The script was on schedule.</p>
<p>But Thomas lost his handle as he tried to drive into the lane, the Mavs&#8217; Williams upped his streak of consecutive free throws to 30 to start the season, and Mark Cuban got some measure of revenge for the ill fated Rajon Rondo trade last year by celebrating a Mavericks win on he parquet floor.</p>
<p>Not only did the loss drop the Celtics to 6-5, it represented a missed opportunity to capitalize on a doubly meaningful win. No, it wouldn&#8217;t have counted twice in the win column, but the Celtics own the Mavericks top-seven protected pick in the upcoming NBA draft. Adding to the Dallas loss total while also walking away with a win would have helped the Celtics cause both this year and next year by perhaps inching the Mavericks that much closer to the back-end of the NBA lottery. Blast!</p>
<p>Luckily, the Celtics are going to have two more chances to help their own cause in more than one way with a home-and-home against the one and only Brooklyn Nets. The Nets, of course, owe the Celtics their unprotected first round pick in the 2016 NBA Draft thanks to their trade for Paul Pierce and &#8220;all about <i>eighteen</i>&#8221; star Kevin Garnett. And with just two wins on the season (really, Rockets and Hawks??) are poised to deliver a prime pick at the top of the lottery. A couple of wins over their divisional counterparts will only push those lottery odds higher (can you say Ben Simmons??).</p>
<p>Hopefully the Celtics can do a better job of improving their playoff odds for both this season and next against the Nets than they did against the Mavericks. That way the next &#8220;all about <i>eighteen</i>&#8221; is actually about another Celtics championship, not a lost opportunity in November.</p>

<p>The contract is reportedly for two years and $11 million, with the second year being a player option that would allow Pierce to re-enter free agency next summer if he so chooses.</p>

<p>We all remember the awkward shoulder tap from the first game the Celtics played the Heat in 2012. Garnett admitted to not having Allen&#8217;s number in his phone.
