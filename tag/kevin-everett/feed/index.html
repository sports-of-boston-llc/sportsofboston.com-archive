<p>Many times in sports we can take for granted the sacrifice that athletes make for their sports. Many times with serious injuries such as an ACL tear, separated shoulder or a broken ankle, fans and players deal with the loss and move on. Though sometimes &#8211; and it&#8217;s a miracle it doesn&#8217;t happen more often &#8211; the injuries are so severe that the loss of football playing time is irrelevant.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Bills tight end <a href="http://www.nfl.com/players/kevineverett/profile?id=EVE276484">Kevin Everett</a>, 25, sustained a horrific injury that may very well paralyze him for life. After he attempted to make a tackle on the second half opening kickoff against the Denver Broncos, Everett lay motionless until he was carted off by an ambulance and taken to the hospital.</p>
<p>After surgery on his neck and spine, information was released just hours ago that Everett is under sedation in the ICU and may never make a full recovery. From associated press story via ESPN.com:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A best-case scenario is full recovery, but not likely,&#8221; Dr. Andrew Cappuccino said, one day after performing a four-hour operation on the player. &#8220;I believe there will be some permanent neurological paralysis. &#8230; A full neurological recovery was bleak, dismal.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Everett was not a superstar in the NFL, making just two catches for the Bills in 17 games and was used primarily on special teams.</p>
<p>Whether this was a backup tight end or a star quarterback, it must be remembered the sacrifice made by professional athletes and the risks they take putting their bodies on the line. It&#8217;s a surprise this sort of thing doesn&#8217;t happen more often, but it&#8217;s still a tragedy when it does.</p>
<p>All of us at SportsofBoston.com give Kevin, his family and all those affected our best wishes as they struggle through this trying time.</p>
