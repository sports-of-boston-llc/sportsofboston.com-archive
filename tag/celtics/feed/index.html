The Celtics are colliding with the defending NBA Champion Cleveland Cavaliers for the Eastern Conference title. After disposing of the both the Indiana Pacers and Toronto Raptors in four straight, the Cavaliers have had time to prepare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Should Head Coach Brad Miller’s charges make it to the conference finals, there will be plenty of NBA expert picks and naysayers saying the Celtics don’t have the horses to match up with Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, Lebron James and company. On the season, the two teams split two games, successfully defending its home court. If either team has an advantage, it lies in the fact Boston holds home court advantage due to its #1 seeding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For all the tipsters who are releasing NBA expert tips naming the Cavaliers as the play, they might want to consult with Boston’s little mighty mite Isaiah Thomas. Even at 5’9”, Thomas has proven to be a nightmare for opposing defenses all year long. Taking everything into consideration, it wouldn’t be a shocker to see Thomas take the league MVP honors over players like Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry (two-time reigning MVP), James Harden and Kawhi Leonard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the regular season, Thomas finished third in the league in scoring with 28.9 PPG on 44.3% shooting from the field, 36.7% from beyond the arc and 87.6% from the charity stripe. No one will soon forget game two of the current series when Thomas and Washington point guard John Wall engaged in an old fashion NBA shootout with Thomas taking the honors with 53 points in a big overtime win. What made the performance all the more impressive was Thomas had given a eulogy for his sister just days before the game. He had also been in the hospital on the day of the game for treatment on the teeth that had been knocked out in the prior game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As current NBA expert picks would indicate, the Celts are going to need other contributions in order to topple James and the red-hot Cavaliers. That help will have to come from </span><a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4240/avery-bradley"><span style="font-weight: 400">Avery Bradley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, who has been feast or famine throughout the playoffs. After averaging only 6 points per game in games 3 and 4 versus the Wizards, Bradley responded with a spectacular performance in game 5. He scored 29 points on 12 of 19 shooting from the field to go along with 6 rebounds and 3 assists. If he performs anywhere near that level against the Cavaliers with center Al Horford controlling the middle, the Celtics would seem more than capable of springing a surprise on the way to the NBA Finals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the conference championships and finals next up on the schedule, now is the time to be </span><a href="http://www.bettingpro.com.au/subcategory/basketball/nba/"><span style="font-weight: 400">looking for NBA expert tips</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.

<p>This road trip will last a long time in the memories of players and fan all across the nation. Why? On April 1, the Celtics marched into Oracle Arena in Oakland, Calif. and abruptly ended the Golden State Warriors&#8217; record-breaking 54 game home winning streak with a score of 109-106.

Throughout the draft process and leading up to free agency, what always gave me, and others, hope was that &#8220;Ainge has a master plan.&#8221; Well, I am starting to think that plan will look a little too similar to Sam Hinkie&#8217;s in Philadelphia. One difference is, there is still plenty to be hopeful about.</p>
<p>Maybe none of the top free agents had much of a thought about coming to Boston and the deals that were struck, though all fine, aren&#8217;t changing next seasons outcome by much. But there was one item that made me want to cry tears of joy which is: Jae Crowder&#8217;s five-year, $35 million deal. This could turn out to be one of the best deals of free agency. Crowder instantly became one of my favorite Celtics from the time he arrive and locking him up at that price could be a difference maker. It may not make an immediate impact but his potential, the length and price make this one of the few bright spots of the Celtics off-season.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/07/05/preparing-for-another-year-of-rebuilding-for-the-celtics/">Preparing for Another Year of Rebuilding for the Celtics</a> (574 words)</p>

The big questions that will continue to lure over the C’s until the draft is underway is what should the Celts do on draft night?</p>
<p>During last year’s draft, there was all kinds of chatter that the C’s were going to trade for a marquee player (aka Kevin Love), instead, they stayed at home and drafted Marcus Smart, (#6) and James Young, (#17). This year’s draft has different feel, but the rumors are swirling as strong as ever. There was even a proposed trade this week, that the C’s were trying to send Smart, and their two first round picks, (#16 and #28), to the Philadelphia 76ers for Nerlens Noel and the #3 pick. The trade offer was rejected by Philly, but this proposal shows that even the Celtics best players may be traded Thursday night.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/06/24/what-are-viable-options-for-the-celtics-on-draft-night/">What are Viable Options for the Celtics on Draft Night?</a> (569 words)</p>

<p>In case you haven’t noticed, the Boston sports teams are all in a state of disarray. The Red Sox are quickly becoming the laughing stock of Major League Baseball with one of the highest payrolls in the league and a collection of underperforming players.</p>
<p>The only bright spot on the team thus far has to be the emergence of left handed pitcher Eduardo Rodriguez. Since being called up on May 29th against the Texas Rangers, Rodriguez has posted impressive numbers by going 2-0 with a microscopic 0.44 era and 21 strikeouts.</p>
<p>In probably the most disappointing team of the year, the Boston Bruins have to make some much needed changes this offseason. It started with Peter Chiarelli departing for Edmonton and hiring Assistant General Manager Don Sweeney to General Manager. The team also decided to part ways with Carl Soderberg. Recent trade speculation has been swirling around that defenseman Dougie Hamilton is seeking a deal worth up to $8 million per season, which may be too rich for the Bruins’ taste and <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/nhl/post/_/id/38249/rumblings-offer-sheet-for-dougie-hamilton" target="_blank">a possible trading partner could be no other than Chiarelli and the Edmonton Oilers</a>, as stated by Pierre LeBrun of ESPN.</p>
<p>Even though the Celtics made the playoffs this year, they may have been better off going into the lottery as they are trying to reposition themselves in the draft to get a higher selection. They have four draft choices this year. They are unlikely to keep all of those picks, as they will be looking for trading partners or use a few on European players and stash them overseas for a few years. Even though a man appearing to be <a href="http://nesn.com/2015/06/lamarcus-aldridge-spotted-in-boston-reason-for-visit-unclear-photo/" target="_blank">LaMarcus Aldridge was spotted at Logan Airport last week</a>, it is likely that he will sign with a team from Texas, according to ESPN’s Ric Bucher. It will be interesting to see what Danny Ainge has up his sleeve this summer, but if they keep to this model, it will be a few years until they can seriously go themselves serious contenders and out of the purgatory which is being mediocre in the NBA.</p>
<p>The Patriots have made a lot more noise off the field than they would have preferred. Star quarterback Tom Brady could potentially miss up to four games and they have released their first three starting cornerbacks in Darrelle Revis, Brandon Browner, and Kyle Arrington respectively. Longtime staple in the defensive line, Vince Wilfork, has moved on to play for the Texans. The Patriots will also have to forfeit a 2016 first round pick and 2017 fourth round pick. The Patriots have to turn to second-year quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo to fill the void of Brady’s absence.</p>
<p>In order of fan base confidence, it has to be the Patriots, Bruins, Celtics, and last and certainly least, the Red Sox. One might feel as though the Bruins and Celtics can be interchangeable based on the number of draft assets that Danny Ainge has to work with and the high volume of question marks surrounding this Bruins team. The two that are not debatable, however, are the Patriots and Red Sox. The Patriots are coming off of a Super Bowl win. Albeit difficult to repeat in the NFL, it anyone can do it, it is Bill Belichick and the Patriots, especially in a weak AFC Conference. <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25066031/2015-nfl-strength-of-schedule-steelers-at-no-1-falcons-at-no-32" target="_blank">As John Breech of CBSSports.com noted, the Patriots have the 11th easiest schedule in the league</a>.</p>
<p>It is tough to look someone in the eye these days and say that you have confidence in these Red Sox. They blew a 7-run lead to the Toronto Blue Jays last night, which is nothing short of an embarrassment. Take into account the clubhouse, especially <a href="http://nesn.com/2015/06/wade-miley-i-let-my-emotions-get-the-best-of-me-in-dugout-blowout-video/" target="_blank">Wade Miley’s meltdown with John Farrell in Baltimore Thursday night</a>. As a fan, you always want your team to succeed. However, this team doesn’t deserve to win the way they have been playing.</p>
<p>It is an interesting time to be a fan in Boston with a lot more question marks than answers. Hopefully they will be in our favor sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
John O’Callaghan, an objective Boston Sports Fan</p>

Until today, the last two pieces of that 2008 Championship Celtics team remaining in the playoffs were Doc Rivers and Glen Davis.  While Glen Davis has undeniably struggled since joining the Los Angeles Clippers last year, Doc Rivers&#8217; career in LA has been an enigma: equal parts triumphant and disgraceful. He has simultaneously turned the Los Angeles into a legitimate contender for the foreseeable future while prevented them from winning an <em>extremely</em> winnable series against the Houston Rockets. The crux of this dilemma resides in Doc Rivers&#8217; increased responsibilities that were granted to him after becoming the Los Angeles Clippers President.</p>
<p>Doc Rivers transition from television personality to NBA Head Coach proved victorious after he led the 1999-2000 Orlando Magic who many considered a bottom-three team, to a 41-41 record. He earned himself a Coach of the Year Award for his ability to make something out of team that was headlined by Darrell Armstrong (who?). While he would eventually lead the Magic to the playoffs for the next three seasons, his Orlando Magic became first-round fodder each year, leading many to question Doc&#8217;s coaching abilities. After an abysmal 1-10 start in the 2003-2004 season, Orlando fired Doc, returning Doc to his broadcasting career. When Danny finally rescued Doc from a destiny akin to Reggie Miller and Chris Webber, Doc was once again met with criticism up until the point they raised banner 17 into the Garden&#8217;s rafters.</p>
<p>By 2012, Doc had successfully catapulted himself into the Gregg Popovich stratospheres of un-touchability. Because of the well-documented respect his players had for Rivers, in addition to his creative after-timeout offensive plays, he was universally recognized as a Top-3 coach.  Unfortunately for Rivers, through no fault of his own, the Celtics were no longer a top-3 team, and following a first-round exit in the 2013 playoffs, his future was in question. While he was still under contract with the Celtics, it became clear after months of failing to answer whether or not he was returning to the Celtics that his time in Boston had come to a conclusion. It was for Boston fans to understand why Rivers was reluctant to coach a rebuilding Celtics and perhaps it was the silver lining of an unprotected First Round draft pick that softened the blow of Doc&#8217;s departure. The opportunity to coach Chris Paul and Blake Griffin as opposed to say, Jordan Crawford and Vitor Faverani, in addition to having full control over player personnel as the Clippers new GM, was simply too good of a package for Celtics fans to feel any kind of resentment for Doc.</p>
<p>Fast forward to May 17, 2015: the day the Clippers became the 9th team in NBA history to blow a 3-1 series lead. Doc Rivers had triumphed over the reigning-champions San Antonio Spurs in the previous round and had all but figured out how to contain MVP-runner up James Harden. Yet, it was the Houston Rockets bench players that proved catalyzed the Clippers epic reversal of fortune. Down 15 with 14 minutes left in Game 6 of the Western Conference Semi-Finals in Los Angeles, Kevin McHale removed Harden from the game and employed a bench-heavy lineup for the remainder regulation. The Rockets B-squad overcame the massive deficit and surmounted the panicked Los Angeles Clippers by outscoring Chris Paul and company 40-15 in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>What the Rockets have that the Clippers don&#8217;t &#8211; isn&#8217;t coaching or star power &#8211; but a bench that meshes. Doc the GM attempted to emulate fellow Coach/GM Gregg Popovich&#8217;s bench model by assembling a bench with skills contradictory to their starting counterparts. For example, at the center position, he grabbed Spencer Hawes &#8211; a floor stretching center &#8211; to contradict Deandre Jordan&#8217;s inability to hit shots from anywhere, especially from the free-throw line. What Doc had failed to anticipate was for the pieces to simply just not fit. Hedo Turkoglu&#8217;s skills haven&#8217;t been at an NBA level for three years while Jamal Crawford has year-in and year-out proved to be a playoff no-show, failing to shoot over 40% in five straight playoffs (notably posting an abysmal 9.9 PER in this year&#8217;s playoffs). It was when Doc Rivers had traded for his son, Austin, that Doc the GM began receiving heavy amounts of criticism.  Austin Rivers, who had failed to receive considerable minutes on a short-staffed Hornets team, was on the fast track for Bleacher Reports&#8217; next Top 50 Draft Busts of all time (and still is) when Doc had &#8220;saved&#8221; him and thus successfully staged the single most gratuitous display of Los Angeles nepotism since the Will Smith/Jaden Smith dumpster fire of a movie entitled <em>After Earth.</em></p>
<p>While Doc Rivers had diligently navigated the Clippers through the muddy waters of the Donald Sterling Clippers era, he has let Chris Paul and Blake Griffin down by failing to provide them an adequate bench that&#8217;s capable of holding onto a lead while they rest.  Now Steve Ballmer, who just spent $2 billion on the Clippers last summer, may be in the uncomfortable position of asking Doc to step down from the General Manager role.  Chris Paul will once again suffer through another summer of pundits claiming he&#8217;s a choker, as he once again failed to make the conference finals; a feat he&#8217;s never accomplished in his career.  With Deandre Jordan entering free agency, where he&#8217;ll inevitably receive a max contract from Doc, the Clippers will now have less money to repair their broken roster.   Perhaps Doc will one day look back at his days with the Celtics and think &#8220;maybe I had it pretty good&#8221;, with Danny Ainge as the GM deflecting the majority of the blame for his team&#8217;s shortcomings.  When Doc triumphantly played his &#8220;get out of Boston Free card&#8221;, and thus become the President (coaching and GM duties) of the Los Angeles, he should have known that by upping his powers, he&#8217;d also be increasing the media&#8217;s ammo against him.</p>
<p>While Doc Rivers will forever have a fan in me, its hard to feel bad for him with this predicament on his hands.  He asked for the world, and with that, you inherit the all the world&#8217;s problems.</p>
