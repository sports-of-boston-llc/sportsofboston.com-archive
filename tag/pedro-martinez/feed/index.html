The free agent market featured several top of the rotation pitchers, and the trade market (allegedly) features other pitchers who would easily feature as any team’s ace. The Red Sox ended up making <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=3184&amp;position=P">David Price</a> <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2015/12/red-sox-sign-david-price.html">the richest pitcher in history</a> and they were smart to do so, as Price made the most sense of any available ace. While the contract is obviously exorbitant, signing Price cost the Red Sox nothing but money; no prospect cost in trade, and no draft pick loss since Price <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2015/07/blue-jays-to-acquire-david-price.html">was traded in-season</a>.</p>
<p>Another pitcher in that tier is <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=6893&amp;position=P">Johnny Cueto</a>. Cueto, like Price, would have cost the Red Sox nothing but a sizeable financial commitment since he was a free agent that also <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2015/07/royals-to-acquire-johnny-cueto.html">was traded during the season</a>. Some are saying that the Red Sox would have been better off signing Cueto since <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2015/12/giants-sign-johnny-cueto.html">his agreement with the Giants</a> came in $87 million shorter than the Red Sox commitment to Price. Adding to that sentiment is a report that <a href="http://www.weei.com/sports/boston/this-just-in/211799766/cueto-agrees-6-year-130-deal-giants">the Red Sox were Cueto’s preferred destination</a>, due in large part to his admiration of Red Sox legend <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=200&amp;position=P">Pedro Martinez</a>.</p>

In fact, there is an argument to be made that part of Price’s appeal is that he would only cost the dollar value of his contract to acquire, thus saving the team from having to deal from its farm system. In theory, a large-market team like the Red Sox should be all about these kinds of deals, especially when they have <a href="https://www.baseballprospectus.com/compensation/cots/al-east/boston-red-sox/">some money coming off of the books</a> from <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=2038&amp;position=P">Justin Masterson</a>, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=3057&amp;position=C/1B">Mike Napoli</a>, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=1677&amp;position=OF">Shane Victorino</a>, etc. With that being said, Red Sox ownership has previously been unwilling to approve of the type of contract it would take to sign Price off of the free agent market, even when it came to keeping a fan-favorite like Jon Lester. It hurts to say, but ownership might be right in this case, that they should not sign Price this offseason.</p>

<p>Big Papi&#8217;s pursuit of membership in the 500 home run club has been a welcome excuse to keep following the Red Sox this season, and last night&#8217;s celebration of his 500th home run was some quality television. Newly minted Hall of Famer Pedro Martinez, Jason Varitek, and a brand new SUV on the field? Plus a montage of all 500 of Ortiz&#8217;s home runs?

The Red Sox’ subpar record and recent youth movement have combined to make Buchholz and his future an afterthought in recent weeks, but that is not likely to continue much longer. Of course it helps that he hasn’t taken the mound since July 10<sup>th</sup>, and seems to be in no rush to return to it. There is something to be said for a pitcher being cautious with an injury to his pitching elbow, but if we go on recent quotes from Buchholz regarding his health, it seems like he could be doing more to get close to pitching than he currently is. All this really does is continue a trend of Buchholz taking an injury way too far, and continue to prove that he is unreliable in every sense of the word.</p>
<p>Plenty has been made of Buchholz’s health record (or lack thereof), including the popular sentiment that the Red Sox should have traded him earlier in this season while he still had value. That ship has sailed, so we’re not going to dwell on it here. However, we can look at the fact that Buchholz has only topped 170 innings pitched in roughly one third of his “full” Major League seasons. As an outside observer, it is impossible to say for certain that Buchholz could have pitched more than he has in those seasons, but that lack of durability has to be caused, at least in part, by an inability to pitch through discomfort. Many, many players are on the record stating that a Major League season is a grind, so a ballplayer needs to be able to deal with the nicks and bumps that come with that grind. No player is likely going to be at 100% through the course of an entire season, but some are able to persevere better than others.</p>

The event took place just prior to the Red Sox facing the Chicago White Sox.</p>
<p>The recent Hall of Fame Inductee was honored at the ballpark and fans were given a miniature Hall of Fame plaque detailing some of his career statistics as well as player history. During the event a video highlight was shown on the jumbotron giving fans, players, and coaches a chance to admire Pedro&#8217;s supremacy on the mound and his charisma in the dugout and clubhouse. The video also featured Martinez career stats, which got the crowd roaring before he even took the field. So many of the numbers are staggering however a few that got a rise out of those spectating included the following: The 313 strikeouts in 1999, which was Pedro&#8217;s single-season career-high and a Sox franchise record. His 1.74 ERA in 2000, which was ridiculous, keeping in mind the juiced-up players he was fanning on a nightly basis. Then, last but not least, the .760 winning percentage (117-37) with the Red Sox between 1998-2004, best in the majors in that time span.</p>
<p>Martinez, accompanied by his wife and children, waited excitedly as Red Sox legends came out to congratulate him on his accomplishments. It all started with a video message from Nomar Garciaparra, who recalled being inducted into the Latino Hall of Fame with Martinez, he was asked to use two words to describe the sensational ace and said, &#8216;The Best,&#8221; which may simply be the most accurate description.</p>
<p>The ceremony was led by the voice of the Red Sox, Joe Castiglione, who called on Sox greats such as Carl Yastrzemski, Jim Rice, Dwight Evans, Dennis Eckersley, and Carlton Fisk to present Pedro with gifts and memorabilia. One unique gift was a bronze mold, covered in gold, of Pedro&#8217;s huge hands and freakishly long fingers. It was, after all, these fingers that allowed him to force righties out of the batters box, waving at that up and in, high-rising fastball and then make most who faced him look foolish with a one of a kind change up. Martinez was also presented with a laptop computer full of video highlights of his career from teammates Curt Schilling, Trot Nixon and Orlando Cabrera. A special thank you and a call to review &#8216;El Tiante&#8217; Luis Tiant all-time numbers for further accolades was made by Pedro during his speech. He also thanked former Expos manager Felipe Alou as well as Ralph Avila, the scout who first discovered Martinez at a young age in the Dominican Republic. Sox favorite Tim Wakefield made an appearance and presented the Martinez family with a donation to his charity. Pedro also took time for heartfelt gratitude aimed at all the fans in Red Sox Nation.</p>
<p>It was David Ortiz that set in motion the unveiling of #45, which will now forever be a part of Fenway Park and the Red Sox organization and never again be worn by a Sox player. Ortiz spoke to the Fenway Faithful to address Pedro&#8217;s amazing career but also his genuine personality that New England came to fall in love with during his time in Boston.</p>
<p>Before Martinez could finish his speech, he brought out his catcher Jason Varitek to share the moment with him calling it &#8220;his moment, too.&#8221; This was apparently off script as Varitek was to come out for the first pitch, to this Martinez said, &#8220;Hey, this is Pedro,&#8221; and, much to the delight of the crowd, referred to the celebration as &#8220;my party.&#8221; The Hall of Fame pitcher took the mound for the final time in front of a standing ovation as he threw out the first pitch, high and tight of course, to his battery-mate Varitek.</p>
<p>In Pedro&#8217;s career he was voted onto eight All-Star teams, and won three Cy Young Awards while piling up 3,154 strikeouts, 219 wins, and a 2.93 career ERA. Pedro recently received 91.1 percent of the vote to be inducted into the Hall of Fame, joining this years class of baseball legends. Whether it was blowing away the side or taping a player to a post in the dugout, Martinez was as integral a part of the Red Sox as there was at the turn of the millennium. Pedro dazzled all those who watched him with his electric fastball, majestic change-up and infectious smile. His dominance as a pitcher and his leadership in the clubhouse helped Boston reverse the curse and win the 2004 World Series. Pedro&#8217;s role on that team, and the greatness of his Red Sox career will never be forgotten, and now remembering is just as easy as turning your head toward right field.</p>
