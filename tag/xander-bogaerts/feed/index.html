<p>Over this road trip, The Sox starters have a combined ERA of 1.51.  It doesn&#8217;t matter who&#8217;s on the mound right now, from Price, Porcello, Pomeranz, and even Clay Buchholz, they are all producing.  Most impressive all the starters are able lately to go deeper in the game, which really helps with a bullpen as putrid as The Sox pen.  With these being the dog days of summer and another long road trip on the horizon, The starters have to continue to dominate the way they have been.</p>
<p>The offense hasn&#8217;t been too shabby over this stretch.  Betts and Ortiz have been hot of late, and with constant contributing from Sandy Leon, Dustin Pedroia, and Hanley Ramirez this offense isn&#8217;t showing any signs of slowing up.  It would be nice to see Xander get going, his last two games he has had two hit in each game, which is a good sign.  As well as the starters have been pitching they could go south very fast, and if or when that happens it will be up to the offense to carry the load.</p>

They took a beating from the surging Tigers, and they were on the verge of being stomped out by the under-performing, last place Angels. All day long, the offense was stagnant to say the least. Steven Wright, who has been a shell of the pitcher we came to love earlier this season, did his best to work his way in and out of trouble throughout the entire afternoon. But his tightrope act eventually succeeded three runs to an Angels offense that should have jumped all over the knuckleballer much earlier in the game. As the innings painfully kept rolling along, the Sox offense did their best to ensure that the Angels would walk away with a 3-1 series victory.</p>
<p>That was until Dustin Pedroia came to the plate with two on and two out in the top of the ninth inning. Pedey took a high, first pitch fastball from Houston Street that was right in his wheelhouse. It appeared as though he&#8217;d missed his pitch, but Street went right back to the well with another high heater, and the former AL MVP jumped all over it and sent it over the center field wall to put the Sox up 4-3. For good measure, Xander Bogaerts followed up Pedroia&#8217;s heroics with a yabo of his own, and the Sox were able to close out a 5-3 victory in a game that they had no business winning in the first place.</p>
<p>These are the kinds of games that playoff caliber teams, and moreover, championship caliber teams find ways to win. There&#8217;s no telling if this Sox team has the resolve to be either of those just yet, but it&#8217;s certainly a step in the right direction. Lord knows the Orioles and Jays aren&#8217;t going anywhere anytime soon.</p>

Two Red Sox players are considered to be serious contenders in this year&#8217;s insanely competitive AL MVP race. Those two players are Xander Bogaerts and David Ortiz. However there are many other great players to consider when talking about the MVP race.</p>
<h2>Potential AL MVP Candidates</h2>
<ul>
<li>Josh Donaldson</li>
<li>Jose Altuve</li>
<li>Robinson Cano</li>
<li>Mike Trout</li>
<li>Manny Machado</li>
</ul>
<p>Many people put Josh Donaldson at the top of the list right now. Donaldson was the AL MVP last season and is once again having himself a fantastic season. But I personally wouldn&#8217;t put him at the top of the list right now. If I had to choose a player right now to be at the top of the AL MVP race I would choose Astros 2B Jose Altuve. Altuve currently leads to MLB with 135 hits and a .358 AVG. Right behind Altuve I would put Ortiz. Ortiz leads the MLB with 34 doubles, a SLG of .665, and an OPS of 1.083.</p>
<p>The only problem with Ortiz is that he&#8217;s a DH. Many people use that against him because there are no defensive stats to credit him with. But with the performance David is having at the plate this year makes him a serious contender for the MVP award in his final season.</p>
<p>Do not forget about Xander Bogaerts. He is being viewed as a genuine player to win the award. He is arguably one of the best hitting shortstops in the entire MLB. As of Saturday Xander has 125 hits (3rd in the MLB behind Jose Altuve and Mookie Betts), 23 doubles, 11 home runs, 61 RBIs, .324 AVG, .381 OBP, .469 SLG, and a .850 OPS. Xander is also a very good defensive player with a .973 fielding percentage and only 9 errors in 813 innings.</p>
<p>The AL MVP race is going to be a very competitive one this year because there are so may players that could take the crown. But it is only half way through the season so nobody knows who&#8217;s going to stay on track or drop off the candidate list. All I&#8217;m saying is to not count the Sox sluggers out of the race, especially Ortiz. Even though he&#8217;s a DH, he&#8217;s putting up one of the best seasons of his career and has some of the best numbers in the game right now.</p>
<p>Can you imagine a 40 year old in his last season winning an MVP award? We can only hope&#8230;</p>

<p>This game held special meaning for David Ortiz, the AL DH. In his final season, and final all star game, Ortiz was the starter for the AL at DH. While Ortiz was certainly the man of the hour, it was his Red Sox counterparts that actually outperformed Papi in San Diego.</p>
<p>Ortiz went 0 for 1, with a walk, and was pulled shortly thereafter. Xander Bogaerts, Mookie Betts, and JBJ all had at least one hit, contributing to the 4-2 victory over the NL.</p>
<p>Xander smacked a double down the left field line, Betts singled and scored, and Jackie Bradley sent two singles through the infield.</p>
<p>Eric Hosmer was the game&#8217;s MVP, who homered and drove in two runs.</p>
<p>The Red Sox are back in action tonight, taking on the Yankees in the Bronx. Eduardo Rodriguez is starting for the Red Sox.</p>
<p>The Red Sox are doing well so far in July. It has been no secret that pitching has been holding this team back. As previously spoken about on SOB, Dave Dombrowski traded Anderson Espinoza, the number one pitching prospect for the Red Sox to San Diego for Drew Pomeranz, who is likely to be the number two or three starter for Boston moving forward.</p>
<p>The Red Sox also managed to sign their first round draft pick, Jason Groome, to a $3.65 million contract, pending a physical.</p>

<p><strong>Team Grade B+</strong></p>
<p>B+ seems like an acceptable grade to give this Red Sox team.  They have had some timely hitting, good pitching at time, and seems like this team enjoys each other&#8217;s company and playing everyday.</p>
<p><strong>Biggest </strong><b>Disappointment</b></p>
<p>The biggest disappointment thus far has been Craig Kimbrel in my eyes.  Yes, David Price is a solid answer as well, however I really thought Kimbrel was going to be dominant.  Farrell also needs to do a better job using Kimbrell.  I actually think his stint on the DL could be a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p><strong>Biggest Surprise</strong></p>
<p>The common answer in this category is Jackie Bradley Jr, However the answer is David Ortiz.  Really who could have predicted this season from Ortiz?  He is top 10 in nearly every american league hitting statistic, and is hitting for both average and power this season.  More importantly he has been a real leader in the clubhouse and on the field.</p>
<p><strong>MVP</strong></p>
<p>Xander Bogaerts has been the best player for The Sox this season, you could even argue he has been the best player in baseball this season.  Xander is doing it both in the field and at the plate this season.  He is hitting .331 which is good for 2nd in the American League, already has double digit home runs with 10, and most impressively he has been hitting well to all fields this season.  Xander is cementing himself as the best shortstop and maybe player in the Majors.</p>

<p>This is even more exciting to hear knowing that four Red Sox players could be starting the game. Xander Bogaerts, David Ortiz, Mookie Betts, and Jackie Bradley Jr. all seem destined to have the highest vote-count at their respective positions, and the fans will likely see more Sox on the field in the first inning than any other team.</p>
<p>The final rosters for the ASG will be revealed at 7 pm on ESPN. Expect Boston to once again have a strong presence in the making of the AL team.</p>

It might be easy to say that it&#8217;s not surprising that Buchholz struggled against a Rangers team with the best record in the American League, especially with how Buchholz&#8217;s season has gone this year. But John Farrell used his faith in Buchholz to justify not bringing up a reliever from Pawtucket a night after <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8185&amp;position=P">Steven Wright</a> did not make it out of the fifth inning, and two nights after <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=3184&amp;position=P">David Price</a> didn&#8217;t make it out of the third. Most Red Sox fans already knew that faith was misguided, and were not surprised when Buchholz allowed the first six batters he faced to reach base, putting giving the Rangers an immediate lead they would not give up. Buchholz also walked more batters (5) than he struck out (3), further illustrating why he was demoted to the bullpen earlier in the season. Sadly the Red Sox find themselves thin on options as far as starting pitching is concerned, but there really is no reason to send Buchholz back out for another start. He has had more than his fair share of chances in Boston, and he has proven that the only thing he can be counted on to do is under-perform.</p>
<p>A few more notes from Sunday&#8217;s game:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=10607&amp;position=OF">Bryce Brentz</a> went 2-for-3 with a solo homer, the first of his Major League career. It will be interesting to see if the Red Sox try to get Brentz some playing time in Left Field going forward, as his bat could be starting to heat up. His main competition in Left, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=10700&amp;position=OF">Ryan LaMarre</a>, has done absolutely nothing with the bat since coming up from Pawtucket, so there should be plenty of playing time available for whoever is performing at the moment.</li>

<p>The Red Sox are set up good with their pitching for the series, with what I think are their 3 best pitchers in Price,Wright and Rodriguez pitching respectively. The Sox are also set up well with all the off days they&#8217;ve had lately, the bullpen is rested and more importantly David Ortiz should be well rested.  Also as we all know this Red Sox offense plays much better at home, they abuse the left field wall and really feed off the home crowd.  All and all it will come down to pitching this series, and Price has to set the tone on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Taking two games from the Orioles this series will be a really good start the this home stand.</p>

The Sox, (33-24, T-1st in A.L East), will head back to the Bay Area for the first time since 2013, and will go up against a loaded Giants squad, (35-24, 1st in N.L West), who are one of the top teams in all of Major League Baseball.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday 6/7 @ Giants:</strong></p>
<p>Rick Porcello (7-2 4.00 ERA) vs Albert Suarez (1-1 3.18 ERA)</p>
<p>Players to Watch: David Ortiz and Hunter Pence</p>
<p>Ortiz continues to torch opposing pitchers in his final season with his offensive stats near or at the top of almost every category in the MLB. He is currently batting .340 AVG (4th), with 54 RBIs (1st), and 16 homeruns (T-4th). Pence is having another solid season with the Giants, batting .298 with 36 RBIs and seven homeruns.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday 6/8 @ Giants:</strong></p>
<p>David Price (7-2 4.88 ERA) vs Madison Bumgarner (7-2 1.91 ERA)</p>
<p>Players to Watch: Xander Bogaerts and Brandon Crawford</p>
<p>Each teams left-handed ace will take the mound for the final game of the series, so expect an all out duel on the rubber for this one. On the offensive side, look for shortstops Bogaerts and Crawford to pace the scoring for their respective clubs. Bogaerts is right behind Ortiz in batting average sporting a .345 AVG, good for third best in the MLB, with 33 RBIs and six homeruns as well. Crawford boasts a .247 AVG with 30 RBIs and six homeruns.</p>
<p>First pitch for both games is scheduled for 10:15pm ET.</p>

<p>Bogaerts posted averages of .240, .250 in his first two seasons, then skyrocketed to .320 this past season.  This season he is currently on a 20 game hitting streak  and is batting .347, more impressive has been his defense.  In his first full season at shortstop he posted a .910 fielding percentage, In his second season this increased to .984, this season is is at a terrific .994.  He has only committed one error on the season.  As the stats show Xander struggled at first, but was willing to put in the work and get better.</p>
<p>Xander is the man of the future in Boston.  He is going to cost The Sox close to 200 million dollars to sign long term.  I think he will be worth it and is a guy you can build around.  He&#8217;s a leader, a winner and a very good baseball player.  He goes about his business quietly, and acts like a pro on and off the field.  Jeesh I just described Jeter, maybe he can be in the same discussion as Jeter when he&#8217;s all done.</p>
