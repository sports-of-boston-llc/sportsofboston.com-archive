<p>There&#8217;s a reason Manny Delcarmen&#8217;s name is being floated about <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/12/07/manny-back-in-boston/">a potential return to Boston</a>, and that&#8217;s because you can never discount a favorite son returning home. The Hyde Park native and West Roxbury High School graduate was a second-round draft pick by Boston in 2000.  The pick made Delcarmen the first draftee from a Boston public high school in 34 years and he made his big-league debut for the Sox on July 26, 2005 against the Rays in Tampa. Anything that Delcarmen would do from that point on would be closely watched by local inner-city kids, hoping to follow his path.</p>
<p>Delcarmen has roots in South End Baseball&#8217;s Boston Astros, an experience that he said, &#8220;&#8230;changed my life and this is the best program in Boston right now, and I hope it gets stronger.&#8221; He recently returned for a fundraiser on opening night 2009, an event that also drew former Astros players like Minnesota Twins prospect Juan Carlos Portes and Celtics legend Tommy Heinsohn (who obviously was <em>not</em> an Astro). Everybody from Dennis &#8220;Oil Can&#8221; Boyd to Luis Tiant or Nate Robinson and CC Sabathia have been seen around South End Baseball events, whether they be fundraisers or the games themselves. It wasn&#8217;t always this high-profile, however, and despite the league&#8217;s small beginnings, South End Baseball has sprung so many great stories, on the diamond and away from it.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/12/07/south-end-baseball-success-stories-delcarmen-and-beyond/">South End Baseball Success Stories: Delcarmen and Beyond</a> (769 words)</p>
