<h3>QB Dave Shinskie seems to have control of the offense.</h3>
<p>While Justin Tuggle relied on the deep ball, Shinskie relied on the short and medium range passing game. Always more suitable for conservative Offensive Coordinator Gary Tranquill, Shinskie played to his abilities, even showing a little movement in the pocket, and the offense looked back on track after a miserable Clemson outing. Yet, Shinskie still cannot throw the long ball and looked tight for the fourth quarter and overtime. Overall though, Shinskie looks like the solid starter going into the Florida State game, but I feel Tuggle could get a look if Shinskie struggles mightily against a stout Seminole defense.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/09/29/five-eagle-eyed-thoughts-from-week-four/">Five Eagle Eyed Thoughts from Week Four</a> (403 words)</p>

(AP Photo/Lisa Poole)" ></a><p>Looking back on the opening game of the season, here are five observations on the BC Football team.</p>
<h3>Freshman QB Mike Marscovetra should have redshirted</h3>
<p>He clearly stands as number three on the depth chart, eons behind Justin Tuggle and Dave Shinskie. Senior QB/FB Codi Boek would have been serviceable in third string. Even if the other three QBs get hurt or share a strain of swine flu, Marscovetra would still have been able to take off his redshirt, but now it looks like a year of riding the pine and wasting eligibility.</p>
<h3>Sophomore Colin Larmond looked good</h3>
<p>With a solid frame of 6’3-196, Larmond showed speed and strength on a 41 yard pass from Tuggle and he almost made an even more impressive play on a Shinskie jump ball at the end of the second quarter. Boston College needs a big receiver to step up next to the 5’11 Rich Gunnell since 6’5 Ifeanyi Momah is on the ice and 6’5 Justin Jarvis is mainly ineffective when put in the game.</p>
<h3>More MLB Luke Kuechly!</h3>
<p>Pronounced KEEK-ly, Kuechly might be my favorite newcomer. Despite weighing a diminutive 225 pounds, Kuechly led the team with seven tackles and a pass breakup in three quarters of work. He flew all over the field and looks like he might take over one of the outside linebackers spots once middle linebacker and team captain Mike McLaughlin returns.</p>
<h3>It will be interesting to see how Boston College will use OLB Dominick LeGrande</h3>
<p>At 6’1-192, Legrande may be the lightest linebacker in the ACC, but may also be the fastest. Georgia Tech uses rover Morgan Burnett, an all-ACC performer, in a capacity where he roams from run to pass coverage. Burnett is 20 pounds heavier and might be the exception and not the rule to the rover position. We will find out soon if LeGrande can hold up against the run when Clemson comes by in two weeks.</p>
<h3>Really, Boston College?</h3>
<p>Coach Frank Spaziani and the gang sent an email to all the student body for football tryouts on September 14. I understand if you want to find the next Rudy or Steve Aponavicius, but shouldn’t the tryout be during the summer practices if you want to get something out of the players. Either BC must be hurting for more players or this tryout is just a dog and pony show. I’m guessing the former. I personally think Boston College is seeking a kickoff specialist after the horrid performance from Ryan Quigley and Steve Aponavicius.</p>
<p>So, there are this week&#8217;s observations. What do you think?</p>
