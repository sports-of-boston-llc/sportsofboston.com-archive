Andrew Miller was a huge factor coming out of the bullpen this series, most of the time leaving The Sox batters swinging at air.  Ben Cherington is the vice president of baseball operations in Toronto.  So basically, Francona and Miller are playing against Cherington, winner plays Theo Epstein and Jon Lester in the World Series.  Jeesh, imagine having all these guys in the same organization.  Oh wait they were, and the ownership screwed it up.</p>
<p>Dave Dombrowski doesn&#8217;t get a pass on this season either.  Aaron Hill, Fernando Abad, Brad Ziegler, and Drew Pomeranz were Dombrowski&#8217;s moves at the deadline.  These guys were a non factor, except for Pomeranz who gave up a 2 run BOMB to Coco Crisp, essentially losing the game.  How about David Price&#8217;s deal?  He got a 7 year, $217 million dollar deal from Dombroski, a deal that will ultimately end up being a failure, if it&#8217;s not already.  For a guy that was supposed to come in and turn things around, Dombrowski has been a letdown as president of baseball operations thus far.</p>
<p>Winning the series at Fenway last night meant a lot to Terry Francona, you could tell by the way he was reacting on the field.  He knows when he was fired that ownership was stirring up rumors about him, and last night he left with the last laugh.  I&#8217;m sure Jon Lester was laughing somewhere too, remember that horrible offer The Sox gave him?  4 years for $70 million?  Then they turn around and give Price 7 years for $217 million, what a joke.  You know what you had in Lester, he could handle the Boston spotlight and he could win in the playoffs.  Two things that David Price can not do.</p>
<p>This team needs a shake up and ownership has to provide it, and as of now it seems like it&#8217;s not going to happen.  Dombrowski just announced Farrell will be back next season.</p>
<p>Ortiz retired and Farrell coming back.  Just doesn&#8217;t seem right.</p>

Tonight, Rick Porcello and his 22 wins will take on Trevor Bauer and the Indians at Progressive field in Cleveland. The Indians, led by former Red Sox manager and fan-favorite Terry Francona, will look to capture their first playoff victory since 2007. Francona, who led the Red Sox to two World Series titles (including the team&#8217;s first in 86 years) was &#8220;let go&#8221; after the Red Sox epic collapse down the stretch of the 2011 season. While the bad blood between Francona and the Red Sox organization seems to have dissipated tremendously since the breakup, I think it&#8217;s safe to say that Francona would love nothing more than to stick it to Red Sox brass, particularly John Henry.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where David Ortiz comes in. The man who has carried this team and this city on his back since that magical run back in 2004 will look to fire up the magic one last time in his final postseason appearance. A World Series title would strengthen David&#8217;s case as one of, if not the greatest playoff performer of all-time. Additionally, it would cement his legacy as one of the three greatest Red Sox players to ever live.</p>
<p>David Ortiz IS October. October rolls around and David Ortiz&#8217;s eye lasers zero in on baseballs and send them to the moon. No pitcher is too clutch. No moment is too big. It&#8217;s time to ride Big Papi to the promise land one final time. God, am I going to miss this guy.</p>
<p>No beisbol is safe, no beisbol is safe.</p>

In just this month only, David Ortiz passed Mickey Mantle on the all time home run list, Rick Porcello reached 20 wins (21st win Monday), Hanley Ramirez was named AL Co-Player of the week on Monday, and Boston now sits in a comfortable four game lead in the AL East.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t been watching the Red Sox play this month then you&#8217;ve been missing out on some great games. They have been playing superb baseball as the post season is right around the corner. The Sox just came off a four game series sweep on the New York Yankees. A series in which Hanley Ramirez homered four times. The series was started off with a monster three run walk off home run from Hanley himself. He now has 28 homers and 106 rbis on the season. Not only is Hanley hitting timely home runs but he has been <strong>DESTROYING </strong>these home runs. I was at Fenway a week ago when the Sox had a 12-2 win over the Orioles and he hit one of the farthest home runs I&#8217;ve ever seen hit over the green monster. I&#8217;m not kidding, it never came down it just kept going up. I seriously think that ball got lost in Mars&#8217; orbit.</p>
<p>On a side note, after ace Rick Porcello picked up his 21st win Monday night over Baltimore, it seems like he may have locked himself in on the AL Cy Young Award. He now is 21-4 on the season and the only competition behind him is J.A. Happ of Toronto who holds a record of 19-4. But Porcello holds a better, ERA, WHIP, and strike out count than Happ. Boston has 12 games left to play in the season so Porcello should probably get a couple more chances to add some wins to his already stellar record.</p>
<p>All that being said, the Red Sox are HOT right now and it couldn&#8217;t come at a better time in the season. The Sox don&#8217;t show any sign of slowing down and are hopeful to play strong into the playoffs. October baseball is almost among us and I&#8217;m very optimistic for great things coming to the city of Boston in the near future.</p>

Coming into Thursday only one game ahead of Baltimore, the Red Sox had some pressure on them. What started off as a slow night turned into one to remember. Heading into the bottom of the ninth at Fenway, the Sox were trailing the Yankees five to one.</p>
<p>Note to self: <strong>NEVER LEAVE A SPORTING EVENT EARLY.</strong></p>
<p>The Sox rallied in the ninth as David Ortiz drove a line drive up the middle to put run number two on the board. Next  up, Mookie Betts drives another run in to make it a two run deficit. Then Hanley Ramirez steps to the plate. Dellin Betances throws a handful of breaking balls to Hanley. When the count showed 3-1, Betances reared back and threw a fastball right down the middle. Ramirez connected with the pitch and hit an absolute moonshot three run home run over the center field wall. Hanley knew it was gone right off the bat, as some may say he &#8220;pimped it&#8221; as he walked down the line and held his bat high in the air.</p>
<p>Hanley gracefully trotted around the bases and then was mauled by his teammates at home plate. The home run was Hanley&#8217;s 25th of the year and it also jumped his rbi count to 100. This win was so important with the AL East standings being so close between the Sox, Orioles, and Blue Jays. Boston now sits in first place and two games ahead of Baltimore. Every game in September is an important win as the Sox are nearing the end of the regular season. Boston has three games remaining in their series with the Yankees.</p>
<p>Not only was tonight a night to remember for Hanley, but also for David Ortiz. In the bottom of the eighth inning, Ortiz hit a line drive home run to center field. It was his 34st homer of the season and also the 537th of his career, passing Mickey Mantle on the all time home run list. David now sits at 17th all time. It&#8217;s really going to be something when he leaves the game.</p>

<p>Porcello has probably been the quietest winning pitcher in all of baseball. After Friday night&#8217;s game Rick holds a 20-3 record. Not only is Rick the best pitcher in baseball right now but the Sox are now in first place and two games ahead of Toronto in the AL East.</p>
<p>The Sox have been playing very well lately as they have won seven of their last ten games. It looks like Boston is establishing themselves as a dominant team in this league as their hitting and pitching has really come around as the season is nearing an end. But much of that success is due to the tremendous season Porcello has had so far. He has a great chance to take the AL Cy Young Award this year.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to get my hopes up, but with the post season right around the corner, I cannot wait for what October has in store for Sox Nation.</p>

The powerhouse hitting Red Sox are now in a position where the postseason is not a guarantee. They have been bouncing in and out of first, second, and third place for a majority of the season. The Red Sox, Blue Jays and Orioles have been the most dominant teams in the Al East all season.</p>
<p>Going into Monday Aug. 29th, the Red Sox sit in second place with a 72-58 record, two games behind the Blue Jays. Baltimore sits right behind the Sox, only one game back. So the question we are all wondering is who is going to win the division?</p>
<p>I believe at this point it&#8217;s a complete toss up. We can pull out as many statistics as we want to predict the end of the season results but we have to remember that this is baseball. This game is so unpredictable, especially when there are only 30 games left to be played. Any team could take the division with being just a half game up, it could be that close.</p>
<p>The good news is that the next month of baseball is going to be tough for all teams in the AL East. Starting tonight until the end of the season the Sox have two remaining series against the Rays, Yankees, Orioles, and the Blue Jays. So the standings in the AL East are going to be jumping all around for the next month. If the Sox want a legitimate chance at taking the division, they need to be the best team in the month of September, period.</p>
<p>If the Sox do not win the division, they always have the Wild Card. But with the Wild Card , the top two teams have to play in a one game playoff match up to decide who moves onto the ALDS. Boston needs to avoid this at all costs because a one game deciding match up is a tough game to win. If this were to happen I&#8217;d be scared to see who Farrell decides to start on the bump.</p>
<p>However I am very confident the Sox will finish the season strong. Their hitting is still very dominant. Ortiz is still showing he&#8217;s one of the best with 30 plus homers and 100 plus RBIs. Mookie is still one of the best hitters in the entire MLB right now with 29 homers, 94 RBIs, and a .321 AVG (Did I mention he was a lead off hitter for the majority of the season?). And Pedey quietly is hitting .320 going into Monday. So the bats are there. Again as we&#8217;ve discussed a million times, it all comes down to the Sox pitching. Starting pitching for Boston has looked better lately, the bullpen is still an issue. All we can do at this point is pray that the pitching comes around going into September.</p>
<p>The toughest series the Sox are going to have this next month are the ones against the Blue Jays. Toronto plays as the biggest threat towards Boston. They are a very well rounded team that can hit and have some pitching. The two series the Sox have against them in the next month are definitely the most imports series they will have all year.</p>
<p>This all being said, I&#8217;m super excited for the next month of baseball because its going to be a a fun one to watch.</p>

<p>Over this road trip, The Sox starters have a combined ERA of 1.51.  It doesn&#8217;t matter who&#8217;s on the mound right now, from Price, Porcello, Pomeranz, and even Clay Buchholz, they are all producing.  Most impressive all the starters are able lately to go deeper in the game, which really helps with a bullpen as putrid as The Sox pen.  With these being the dog days of summer and another long road trip on the horizon, The starters have to continue to dominate the way they have been.</p>
<p>The offense hasn&#8217;t been too shabby over this stretch.  Betts and Ortiz have been hot of late, and with constant contributing from Sandy Leon, Dustin Pedroia, and Hanley Ramirez this offense isn&#8217;t showing any signs of slowing up.  It would be nice to see Xander get going, his last two games he has had two hit in each game, which is a good sign.  As well as the starters have been pitching they could go south very fast, and if or when that happens it will be up to the offense to carry the load.</p>

This was their 6th straight win and they have now moved into the top spot in the wildcard. They are now only one game behind Toronto for first place in the division. One of the many reasons the Sox are playing so well is star outfielder, Mookie Betts.  Betts is playing unbelievable right now and definitely should be in discussion for MVP right now. Since August, he has batted .403, with seven homeruns and 20 RBI’s. He had a three home-run game against Arizona on the 14th and a two home-run game against the Orioles on the 16th. The three home-run game was Bett’s second time doing that this season and the first time a Red Sox player has done that since the great Ted Williams. I know that Jose Altuve is having an amazing year, batting .364 for the Astros, but if the Sox make the playoffs and the Astro’s don’t than Betts should hands down get the MVP.</p>
<p>The Red Sox starting pitching has also been a big factor why they have won 6th straight games. In the past seven days the Sox starting pitching has only let up a total of eleven runs. Rick Porcello picked up his 16th win on Sunday, and all season long has given the Sox a pitcher they can rely on. If Porcello keeps pitching as well as he has, he will definitely be in the discussion for Cy young. Rodriguez has also been a nice surprise lately. In the month of August he has an ERA of 2.08. It really seems like he is turning around his season. Unfortunately, on Tuesday, while pitching a no hitter through four innings he had to come out of the game due to injury. Hopefully, this is just something minor and continues to pitch well for the rest of the season.</p>
<p>The Sox have 43 games left and a three game lead in the Wild card standings so as of right now they are in a good position to make the playoffs. I believe that they will and if they don’t I will consider this season a disappointment. Go sox!</p>

<p>The Red Sox should have won this series pretty easily, but now?  The Yankees are only 3 games back of The Sox in the standings.  The Yankees are not a good team.  They unloaded at the trade deadline by trading, Andrew Miller, Aroldis Chapman, and Carlos Beltran.  New York pretty much waved the white flag at the deadline, and now they have hope.  I&#8217;m not saying The Yankees are a threat in the division or the wild card.  The point is these are the games you have to win when you&#8217;re fighting for a playoff spot.</p>
<p>The Red Sox had a lead going into the 7th inning in all 3 games of the series.  They lost two of those games.  The one game they did win, they walked the bases loaded in the ninth.  This Red Sox bullpen is putrid.  It seems like they can&#8217;t get anyone out, especially when there are guys on base.  It seems like this pitching staff has no guts.  They can&#8217;t get the big strikeout when the pressures on, it seems like they get tight and timid.</p>
<p>This series wasn&#8217;t all the pitching staffs fault.  What happen to the offense?  Just about a month ago they were crushing the baseball.  Now?  They have 2 hits in their last 29 attempts with the bases loaded.  This offense is much to talented to go into slumps like this.  Speaking of slumps, why does it seem the whole team goes in one giant slump at the same time?  It seems like this team is lacking confidence right now.  They could really use a benches clearing brawl to wake them up, or you know they could fire the manager.</p>
<p>They start a 3 game series with Arizona tonight, it&#8217;s safe to say sweeping The Diamondbacks is a must.  Especially with the tough road games on the horizon.</p>
