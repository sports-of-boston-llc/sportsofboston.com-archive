(Associated Press File Photo)" ></a><p><a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4907418" target="_new">ESPN&#8217;s Adam Schefter</a> reported the news that former Titans and Cowboys defensive back Adam “Pacman” Jones worked out with the Cincinnati Bengals on Thursday. Jones played in nine games for the Cowboys in 2008, and was released following the season, not playing in 2009 due to various legal issues relating to violent altercations and alcohol. Still, the Bengals are apparently interested in the defender/special teams returner, which would help bolster their team, which faltered toward the latter end of the latest season. To that end, they also signed former Jaguars receiver Matt Jones to a one year, $700,000 deal.</p>
<p>Jones had his best season in 2006 with the Titans, recording 50 solo tackles and a sack in 15 games. He also returned four interceptions for 130 yards, one of them an 83-yard touchdown return. He returned 20 kicks for 521 yards, and 34 punts for 440 yards. His performance suffered a noticeable dip in quality after his time off, when he played with the Cowboys. Rust would likely continue if he returns with the Bengals, but that is for the Bengals to decide. To help keep his energy up during his 2007 suspension, Jones was also a professional wrestler from August to October with TNA, capturing the organization&#8217;s tag team titles.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/02/12/adam-%e2%80%9cpacman%e2%80%9d-jones-works-out-with-cincinnati/">Adam “Pacman” Jones Works Out With Cincinnati</a> (229 words)</p>
