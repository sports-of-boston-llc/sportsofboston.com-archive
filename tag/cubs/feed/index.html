<p>&#8220;Yeah, why not? I mean this is what I know. This is what I love.&#8221; is what Lester&#8217;s response was when asked in July if he&#8217;d consider a return to Boston. Unfortunately his fate was decided back in the Spring when the Red Sox failed to sign him prior to the start of the season. (...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2014/12/10/jon-lester-thank-you-and-farewell/">Jon Lester: Thank You, and Farewell</a> (877 words)</p>

<p>“While Manny is not and will not be a fit on the Cubs major league roster, we do think at this stage of his life he’s a nice fit as a mentor for some of the young talented hitters we have in the organization,” Epstein said in the press release.  “Manny will coach full-time and play part-time in a limited role that does not take at-bats away from our prospects. If he shows there is still some magic in his bat, perhaps he will find his way to the major leagues and help another team, but that is not why he is here. We are thrilled that he wants to work with our young hitters and make a difference.”(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2014/05/25/cubs-sign-manny-ramirez-as-player-coach/">Cubs Sign Manny Ramirez as Player / Coach</a> (90 words)</p>
