After a senior season in which he was named a 2014 Perfect Game First-Team All-American thanks to a heater that sits aroud 93-96 mph and touches 98, his talent was rewarded with a juicy $1.67 million signing bonus that enticed him out of his commitment to the University of Arizona. As a pitcher he is unpolished but projects as a top of the rotation starter if his development goes according to plan.</p>
<p>Only 19 years old, Kopech is an imposing presence at 6-foot 3-inches tall and 205 pounds. On the mound he works from the left side of the rubber and initiates his deliver from the windup by shifting his body to his left with of his let good and a drop of hands from nose level to his wait. He rocks in to a high leg kick during which his hands move with leg, and then finishes the delivery by falling off the mound in the direction of first base. From this stretch his deliver mimics the same leg kick and hand movement he has from the wind-up.</p>
<p>During his first exposure to professional baseball in 2014 he threw only 13 2/3 innings for the GCL Red Sox, and had a tough 4.77 ERA but did strike out 16 batters. Then last year <span style="line-height: 1.5">he spent the entire season with the Greenville Drive</span><span style="line-height: 1.5">. He</span><span style="line-height: 1.5"> complemented his hard fastball with a developing slider and change-up, and earned himself a 2015 South Atlantic League All-Star selection. O</span><span style="line-height: 1.5">ver 15 starts and a relief appearance he accumulated<span style="line-height: 1.5"> 65 innings pitched</span> and posted a 4-5 record with 70 strikeouts and 2.63 ERA. </span></p>
<p>From a strictly statistical point of view Kopech had an impressive campaign but that analysis overlooks an important consideration. In mid-July his career was thrown a curve ball of its own when he tested positive for Oxilofine, a amphetamine class stimulant in violation of the Minor League Drug Prevention and Treatment Program, and was served a 50-game suspension. Kopech accepted the suspension and apologized for the his controversy but insistently denied that he knowingly used the drug.</p>
<p>Any time a player is linked to performance enhancing drugs there are whispers that emerge which are hard to shake. Until he gives doubters something else to talk about, the allegations will dominate all conversations surrounding him. Given that Kopech is only 19 year sold and claims he had no clue of the substance&#8217;s presence in his system, I expect this story to be forgotten by the end of the year. If he has one good year all the speculation will go away. As a Red Sox fan I sincerely hope it was a honest mistake on his part, and as a baseball fan I expect him to uphold the integrity of the game. Simply put, he must avoid any further controversy surrounding performance enhancing drugs.</p>
<p>Kopech needs to silence the doubters with a big year. It is unclear where he will start the season, but he will likely play a good portion of the year in the Class A-Advanced Carolina League with the Salem Red Sox. If he performs well he may even get a call up to Portland by the fall. This progression is contingent upon the development of his secondary offerings and overall command as a pitcher.</p>
<p>There is no doubt he has the natural talent to become a top of the rotation start in the big leagues. He potential is through the roof. 2016 is an important season for Kopech. He needs to end the critical speculation surrounding last year and move on as a professional by making improvements to his repertoire.</p>
