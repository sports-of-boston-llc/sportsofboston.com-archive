Benintendi, a product of the Arkansas Razorback&#8217;s baseball team, was batting .341 in the Carolina League, and was a major factor in his team&#8217;s successes. One of the most intriguing stat lines this outfielder can claim includes 135 ABs-and only nine strikeouts.</p>
<p>Benintendi ranks as the number three prospect in the Red Sox&#8217;s farm system (#22 overall), and is rising quickly. The 21 year-old also led the Carolina league in several offensive categories, including hits (46), extra base hits (21), and triples (7). Benintendi strung together a 23 game hit-streak early this season, and was always a candidate to be promoted early and often. His swing is pretty to watch, and he has power despite a smaller frame (5&#8242; 10&#8243;, 170).</p>
<p>In two games so far in his new home in Portland, Benintendi has gone 2-7, and has driven in two runs. The move from Single-A to Double-A is never a simple one, and time will be the only judge of whether or not the Red Sox were too quick to advance this electrifying outfielder.</p>

A highly touted infielder for his natural athleticism and raw power, Chavis has yet to live up to the high expectations.</p>
<p>He has a balanced stance from the right handed batters box with his hands steady at shoulder level, and starts his swing with a short, quite stride. He unleashes his hands through the zone with impressive bat speed and scouts regard his raw power potential.</p>
<p>Growing up Chavis played primarily shortstop but when he was draft it was unclear whether he would stick at the position long-term. Last season Red Sox management decided to move him to third-base on a permanent based on their projection of Chavis&#8217; player profile. Unfortunately this transition has not gone smoothly as hoped.</p>
<p>In 39 games at the end of 2014 in rookie league with the GCL Red Sox, he had a decent performance but was not overwhelming. He spent time at both shortstop and third-base in that campaign and posted a respectable .767 OPS with one home-run and 16 RBI.  His trouble was in the field as he made seven errors in 39 games. Then last year, with the class-A Greenville Drive, he seemed to regress further. In 68 games at the hot corner he made 19 errors resulting in a dismal .907 fielding percentage. Chavis needs to work on his technique at the new position and it must be addressed if he wants to progress as a professional, but it is a skill that he can explicitly focus on and improve if he puts in the hard work.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the 20 year old prospect is heralded for his ability to hit the long-ball. Last season with the Drive he hit 16 home-runs and posted an impressive .182 ISO. The concern however is his approach in the batter&#8217;s box; although he hit those home runs, he appended the power output with a lousy 67% contact rate and 6% walk rate. This led to a disquieting .223/.277/.405 slash line.</p>
<p>In his limited professional exposure there are no doubts about Chavis&#8217; power, but the lack of plate discipline and feel for the strike-zone leave more to be desired. This is an aspect of baseball that does not come naturally to many but often improves as players accrue more plate appearances. It clicks for some prospects and not for others so by no means a presumed outcome for Chavis. He really needs to address this facet of his offensive toolbox if he wants to keep up his prospect stock.</p>
<p>Chavis is remains a young prospect very early in his development and despite last year&#8217;s struggles has plenty of time to improve upon the flaws in his game. Raw power is a valued tool in the baseball industry and there is no doubt he has it. 2016 is an important year for him as a professional and he needs to establish himself as a contributor in the Greenville lineup.</p>
<p>He remains years away from a debut at Fenway Park and hasn&#8217;t earned spotlight recognition from Red Sox Nation, but prospect junkies will be sure to have an eye on him in the next few of years. If he addresses the holes in his game and develops as a player I will expect to see him at Hadlock Field by late 2017 or early 2018.</p>

I was fortunate enough to have had the privilege to go attend the game, and what a pleasure it was to watch the Eastern League’s best showcase their talents in front of a sold-out Hadlock Field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gates opened to the public at 3:00 for an eventful afternoon in Portland that included the planned Home Run Derby and a festive pregame introduction ceremony that allowed fans to greet the starters as they made their way down to the field from the sky-boxes. After the National Anthem, Blake Swihart threw out the ceremonial first pitch and, around 7:20, it was time to play ball.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the first pitch of the game Marco Hernandez (BOS) led off with a line-drive single to center field and the game had finally begun. It was a competitive contest and neither team was willing to accept a loss. Both teams attempted to bunt, steal bases, and generally play quality baseball. It was refreshing to watch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both teams featured some of the top prospects for each franchise’s respective MLB affiliate. The advertised top prospects in the game were Josh Bell, Gavin Cecchini, Brandon Nimmo, and Bradley Zimmer. Bell is ranked the Pirates third best prospect according to MLB.com and is a promising hitting prospect that is making a transition from the outfield to first base. Although he has a lot to learn at his new position, Pirates’ management is optimistic due to his superior athleticism and eagerly await the addition of this bat to their lineup as early as next season. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The New York Mets had two top prospects selected to this game, their second overall Brandon Nimmo and fourth overall Gavin Cecchini. Nimmo is known as a hitting outfielder with solid , while Cecchini, the younger brother of Red Sox prospect Garin, is a quality defensive shortstop that has made strides at the plate in the last two years. Both are projected to make their MLB debuts in 2016 by MLB.com. Last but not least is Bradley Zimmer, the Cleveland Indians number one overall prospect. Zimmer is a reknown five tool talent with the potential to become a bonafide superstar. He plays a quality outfield, has an advanced approach at the plate, and offers above average speed to go along with his high baseball IQ. The Indians are not expecting to rush Zimmer and his projected MLB debut is 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The most impressive players to me other than these top prospects were Pedro Severino (WAS) and Anthony Gallas (CLE). Both on the Western Division team. Although Severino did not start the game, he was spectacular behind the plate blocking balls in the dirt with precision and athleticism. He also added a hit and a run scored. Gallas was put on a show in the Homerun Derby and contributed a double, single, RBI, and a run scored in the actual game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some of the other players in the game that baseball fans may see in MLB in the near future included: Roman Quinn (PHI), Dwight Smith Jr. (TOR), Gary Sanchez (NYY), and Wynton Bernard (DET). Needless to say there was some top level talent on display. The only thing that could have made the event better was if Yaz’s grandson, Mike Yastremski (BAL), would have been able to honor his selection and play in the game. Unfortunately he was battling an injury and did not make the trip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now back to the game. Nine innings of quality baseball sulted in a 4-4 stalemate, which lead to quite the unusual ending. Instead of simply ending the contest in a tie the league decided to institute a Home Run Derby Shootout. Each team chose three players who each were given one swing; after these six hitter no one had hit a homerun. After this each round was sudden death. Finally, on the 22nd hitter in the shootout, Brian Pointer (PHI) won it for the Eastern Division. It was a very unusual ending to a baseball game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the game Marco Hernandez (BOS) was awarded the game MVP. He contributed a single, a homerun, two RBI, and two runs scored for the Eastern Division squad.</span></p>

(Jim Davis/Globe Staff)" ></a><p>When <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=29225">Michael Bowden</a> was asked to move into a relief role just a few weeks ago after spending his entire career as a starter, he embraced it as an opportunity to impact the major league club. Though he had been performing well as a starter prior to his move to the bullpen, it appears Felix Doubront has passed him on the starting pitcher depth chart and this would be his best chance to help the club.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Last year against the Yankees was the first time that I had ever pitched out of the bullpen,” the 23-year-old said while still with Pawtucket. “It&#8217;s still something new to me. I felt like I adapted fairly quickly last year when I got the opportunity to go up there and pitch in relief. It was exciting &#8211; every time the phone rang your heart skipped a beat with the adrenaline rush. I really enjoyed my time in the bullpen last year so I&#8217;m excited about this move.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Michael Bowden: The Starter</h2>
<p>Bowden was drafted out of high school in the first round of the 2005 draft. Since being drafted, he has been known for his hard work and excellent pitching instincts. He moved quickly through the system, reaching Double-A Portland by the age of 20, and the major leagues at 21.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/07/20/michael-bowden-the-reliever/">Michael Bowden: The Reliever</a> (692 words)</p>
