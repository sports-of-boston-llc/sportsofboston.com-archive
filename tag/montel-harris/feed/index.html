<p>Boston College is coming off a 7-6 season (4-4 ACC) where they rallied to win their final five games to become bowl eligible. The Eagles faced off against Nevada in the Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl where they lost 20-13.</p>
<p>Montel Harris will lead the Eagles on offense this season. Harris has been tabbed by some as the ACC Preseason Player of the Year. The senior running back could end his career as the leading rusher in ACC history, but he will need some help. BC ranked 109th nationally last season in yards per game and points per game. The Eagles hope that new offensive coordinator Kevin Rodgers, who was the quarterback coach with the Minnesota Vikings, can help the offense take the next step.</p>

(Boston College Sports Information Department / Ken Rivetz via ballparks.com)" ></a><h2><span>The impeccable home record continues!</span></h2>
<p>I don’t know why Alumni Stadium has been such an incredible home field advantage for the Eagles, but the stats speak for themselves:</p>
<table style="padding-left: 30px;" border="0">
<tbody>

<p>Against Central Michigan, the Eagles thoroughly dominated the highly regarded QB Dan LeFevour and a CMU offense that was averaging over 33 points a game was held to 10. LeFevour was held to 26 yards on 11 carries while throwing two interceptions on a day that mirrored his outing four years ago which he also lost. Although this clearly shows that a young B. C. team can get in a groove when at home, Boston College has two ACC road games in their next three games, must wins if Boston College wants any chance to get back to the ACC Title game now that Clemson beat Miami.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/11/05/eagle-eyed-thoughts-week-9/">Eagle Eyed Thoughts Week 9</a> (540 words)</p>

(boston.com)" ></a><p>Sophomore RB Josh Haden and Redshirt Freshman QB Justin Tuggle have both decided to transfer from Boston College today. Both have seen less and less playing time as the year has gone on.</p>
<h3>Justin Tuggle lost the starting QB job and apparently fell to at least third on the depth chart</h3>
<p>Although never said it out loud, the Tuggle transfer seemed imminent with him sitting third on the depth chart recently after starting the first three games. Tuggle’s athleticism was his greatest asset at QB, but he was never accurate and had a tendency to heave down field jump balls even when no one was open. In his first two games against Kent State and Northeastern, he threw for 206 yards and three touchdowns, but against Clemson he fell apart on a dismal 4-20 outing with three interceptions. When true Freshman Mike Marscovetra came in to replace a struggling Dave Shinskie against Virginia Tech instead of Tuggle, it looked like Tuggle’s window of opportunity at BC shut. Even after a rough performance by Shinskie against a weak Notre Dame defense, Tuggle was no longer confident in his chances to succeed at Boston College. Highly touted incoming QB Chase Rettig would have put Tuggle in an even further hole next year if he stayed.</p>
<h3>Montel Harris&#8217; stellar play earning him most of the touches</h3>
<p>What caused more of a stir was the move of Haden from Chestnut Hill. After coming in as the key recruit of the Jeff Jagodzinski era (spurning offers from Florida, Michigan, and Ohio State), Jagodzinski handed Haden the starting spot as a true freshman. Jags believed Haden fit the mold of a fast pass catching tailback perfectly, which fit into then offensive coordinator Steve Logan’s spread offense. Lightly recruited and ex-Duke commit Montel Harris quickly earned a spot in the rotation and ended up gaining 421 more yards on 59 more carries. He had more receiving yards. The duo ended up second in the nation for freshman running back tandem and carried that chemistry into this year with Montel Harris changing his number from 42 to 2 to literally become a 1-2 tandem with Haden.</p>
<p>Harris ran wild this season (with the exception of the Wake Forest game) and, after dominating the Florida State game, never looked back. Haden is currently averaging 1.4 yards less per carry than Haden and 1.1 yards less than promising true freshman Rolandan Finch. His tendency to dance in the backfield and inability to break tackles has greatly hampered his play. Josh Haden’s brother Joe currently plays on the Florida Gators and is one of the top corners in the nation.</p>
<p>Head Coach Frank Spaziani wished both players well.</p>

(AP Photo/Greg M. Cooper)" ></a><h2>Boston College sits in prime position to take the Atlantic Division</h2>
<p>After stunning losses by Clemson and NC State, and let’s be frank, Florida State, Boston College sits right behind a 2-3 Maryland team atop the ACC Atlantic. Maryland, despite upsetting Clemson, has looked awful this year losing to Middle Tennessee State, Rutgers, and California (by 39) while their only other win came in overtime against (FCS) James Madison. Maryland also is only one game into their ACC slate as opposed to Boston College, which currently owns a 2-1 record. The tiebreaker against FSU and Wake Forest (who notched a nice win over NC State) also helps BC a ton and the only must win I see in the foreseeable ACC slate comes in two weeks against NC State at Chestnut Hill. Of course, the Eagles will need to put away Maryland and Virginia while at least splitting the North Carolina and Virginia Tech games. I’m getting entirely to ahead of myself.</p>
<h2>Why can’t Boston College protect a lead?</h2>
