				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First, I want to get it out of the way, I am a Red Sox snob and a die-hard one at that. I feel entitled to that team as if I am on a different level in my relationship with that club.</p>

One argument was that it was all Spring Training games, the other argued that &#8220;the only game that counted was the one Dice-K pitched for, cuz he&#8217;s from Japan.&#8221; Never before have I been more driven to pummel complete strangers.</p>
