				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Patriots have released potential backup QB Andrew Walter. Walter played for the Raiders last season, but obviously didn&#8217;t have what it took to stay with the Patriots this year. Walter was just recently <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/08/03/report-patriots-to-sign-andrew-walter/">signed by the Patriots a one month and a day ago</a>. The decision leaves Brian Hoyer holding the reigns as the sole back up for Tom Brady. In case you missed it, <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/08/30/kevin-oconnell-waived-by-patriots/">Kevin O&#8217;Connell was waived by the Patriots earlier this week</a>. <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/09/04/patriots-38-giants-27-3-things-we-learned/">Hoyer was impressive</a> in the Patriots&#8217; final preseason game so clearly the Patriots have confidence in the undrafted QB.</p>
<p>Coach Belichick had this to say about Walter&#8217;s release:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think Andrew had a lot of positives, and we talked about those when we signed him, and I think they still exist. In the end we still made decisions that are in the best interest of the football team.</p></blockquote>
<p>When asked about whether or not the team would be seeking at least one more backup in addition to Hoyer, Belichick answered (...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/09/04/andrew-walter-released-by-patriots-aj-feeley-a-target/">Andrew Walter Released by Patriots &#8211; A.J.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve become pretty accustomed to the way things work around Foxboro after nearly a decade of the Bill Belichick era yet once in a while we see a roster move that still leaves us shaking our head. That seems to be the case today as the Patriots have waived second year quarterback Kevin O&#8217;Connell.</p>
<p>Having arrived at camp as the presumptive backup to Tom Brady, O&#8217;Connell has struggled in the pre-season and now finds himself without a team. The move is surprising simply because there is no clear backup in the system and O&#8217;Connell seemingly had the job locked up coming into 2009, if not only because he&#8217;s been in the system longer. The second year man from San Diego State was a also a third round pick in the 2008 NFL draft so this again leaves the average fan wondering. </p>
<p>With O&#8217;Connell gone it leaves Andrew Walter and Brian Hoyer on the roster. In other words, look for the Patriots to go after another veteran before the season begins.</p>

The 27-year-old out of Arizona State University has certainly had a very poor professional career. At 6-6, 230 pounds, Walter sure looks the part, but sometimes size doesn&#8217;t matter. In 2006, Walter started eight games for the Raiders where he threw for 1,677 yards while only completing 53.3% of his passes. He also passed for only three touchdowns while being intercepted 13 times.</p>
<p>Now, to Walter&#8217;s defense, he was playing behind one of the worst offensive lines this league has ever seen and because of that he was sacked 46 times during his playing time. Not to mention that his No.1 receiver was out there jogging routes and refusing to go over the middle. Who was that? Oh yeah, Randy Moss.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/08/03/report-patriots-to-sign-andrew-walter/">Patriots sign Andrew Walter</a> (170 words)</p>
