The win in Cleveland was likely the Celtics biggest win of the season, especially being on the road and playing the Cavaliers after they had come off a loss. It looked ugly early for the Celts Friday in Cleveland but they were able to hang in and keep it close in the first two quarters before gaining the lead in the second half. A balanced attack with Isaiah Thomas, Avery Bradley, Evan Turner, Tyler Zeller and Jared Sullinger all scoring in double figures helped to hold off the Cavaliers late game push. The grittiest play of the game came with the Celtics down two points with seconds left. A missed free throw from Evan Turner allowed for Marcus Smart, 6&#8217;4&#8243;, boxing out Timofey Mozgov, 7&#8217;1&#8243; to cause a scramble for the rebound that ultimately went out off the Cavaliers. This afforded the Celtics just the chance they needed and, on a broken play, Bradley gathered himself to knock down the game winning triple from the corner.</p>
<p>Rolling into Sunday winners of three straight and coming off dethroning the mighty King the C&#8217;s hung 46 points on Sacramento in the first quarter en route to the win. They were in control wire to wire despite a pesky performance from the Kings who made runs but were never able to recover from the 76 point first half performance of the Celtics.</p>
<p>Boston is now in sole possession of third place in the Eastern Conference behind Cleveland and Toronto, they are winners of four in a row and nine of their last ten. Celtics&#8217;s fans have reason to be excited with the wins and the way the team has continued to get better and play together. However, four and half games is all that separates the now third place Celtics and the ninth place Hornets. The C&#8217;s will need to continue to win with a tough schedule ahead. Boston not only has a slew of balanced Eastern Conference teams to play that will all be jockeying for position but still has a variety of tough Western Conference opponents to face after the All-Star break including Golden State, Oklahoma City, Los Angeles Clippers (and Lakers), and Memphis to name a few, those wins will not come easy.</p>
<p>For now Boston will head to Milwaukee to go for five straight wins against the Bucks who are losers of five straight, before coming home to face Doc Rivers and his 34-17 Clippers that have won seven of their last ten, doing so without Blake Griffin.</p>
<p>The Celtics should feel confident heading to the Midwest behind their Eastern Conference player of the week Isaiah Thomas who continues to put up numbers and help the C&#8217;s win games. His most recent weekly stat line to earn said honors goes like this: 20.3 points, 7 assists, 4.5 rebounds, and 1.3 steals over 33.6 minutes per game. With the C&#8217;s seeming to play their best basketball of the season coach Brad Stevens will continue to keep their feet on the ground and their eyes on the clipboard to hopefully finish the next two games strong before heading into All-Star weekend.</p>

Until today, the last two pieces of that 2008 Championship Celtics team remaining in the playoffs were Doc Rivers and Glen Davis.  While Glen Davis has undeniably struggled since joining the Los Angeles Clippers last year, Doc Rivers&#8217; career in LA has been an enigma: equal parts triumphant and disgraceful. He has simultaneously turned the Los Angeles into a legitimate contender for the foreseeable future while prevented them from winning an <em>extremely</em> winnable series against the Houston Rockets. The crux of this dilemma resides in Doc Rivers&#8217; increased responsibilities that were granted to him after becoming the Los Angeles Clippers President.</p>
<p>Doc Rivers transition from television personality to NBA Head Coach proved victorious after he led the 1999-2000 Orlando Magic who many considered a bottom-three team, to a 41-41 record. He earned himself a Coach of the Year Award for his ability to make something out of team that was headlined by Darrell Armstrong (who?). While he would eventually lead the Magic to the playoffs for the next three seasons, his Orlando Magic became first-round fodder each year, leading many to question Doc&#8217;s coaching abilities. After an abysmal 1-10 start in the 2003-2004 season, Orlando fired Doc, returning Doc to his broadcasting career. When Danny finally rescued Doc from a destiny akin to Reggie Miller and Chris Webber, Doc was once again met with criticism up until the point they raised banner 17 into the Garden&#8217;s rafters.</p>
<p>By 2012, Doc had successfully catapulted himself into the Gregg Popovich stratospheres of un-touchability. Because of the well-documented respect his players had for Rivers, in addition to his creative after-timeout offensive plays, he was universally recognized as a Top-3 coach.  Unfortunately for Rivers, through no fault of his own, the Celtics were no longer a top-3 team, and following a first-round exit in the 2013 playoffs, his future was in question. While he was still under contract with the Celtics, it became clear after months of failing to answer whether or not he was returning to the Celtics that his time in Boston had come to a conclusion. It was for Boston fans to understand why Rivers was reluctant to coach a rebuilding Celtics and perhaps it was the silver lining of an unprotected First Round draft pick that softened the blow of Doc&#8217;s departure. The opportunity to coach Chris Paul and Blake Griffin as opposed to say, Jordan Crawford and Vitor Faverani, in addition to having full control over player personnel as the Clippers new GM, was simply too good of a package for Celtics fans to feel any kind of resentment for Doc.</p>
<p>Fast forward to May 17, 2015: the day the Clippers became the 9th team in NBA history to blow a 3-1 series lead. Doc Rivers had triumphed over the reigning-champions San Antonio Spurs in the previous round and had all but figured out how to contain MVP-runner up James Harden. Yet, it was the Houston Rockets bench players that proved catalyzed the Clippers epic reversal of fortune. Down 15 with 14 minutes left in Game 6 of the Western Conference Semi-Finals in Los Angeles, Kevin McHale removed Harden from the game and employed a bench-heavy lineup for the remainder regulation. The Rockets B-squad overcame the massive deficit and surmounted the panicked Los Angeles Clippers by outscoring Chris Paul and company 40-15 in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>What the Rockets have that the Clippers don&#8217;t &#8211; isn&#8217;t coaching or star power &#8211; but a bench that meshes. Doc the GM attempted to emulate fellow Coach/GM Gregg Popovich&#8217;s bench model by assembling a bench with skills contradictory to their starting counterparts. For example, at the center position, he grabbed Spencer Hawes &#8211; a floor stretching center &#8211; to contradict Deandre Jordan&#8217;s inability to hit shots from anywhere, especially from the free-throw line. What Doc had failed to anticipate was for the pieces to simply just not fit. Hedo Turkoglu&#8217;s skills haven&#8217;t been at an NBA level for three years while Jamal Crawford has year-in and year-out proved to be a playoff no-show, failing to shoot over 40% in five straight playoffs (notably posting an abysmal 9.9 PER in this year&#8217;s playoffs). It was when Doc Rivers had traded for his son, Austin, that Doc the GM began receiving heavy amounts of criticism.  Austin Rivers, who had failed to receive considerable minutes on a short-staffed Hornets team, was on the fast track for Bleacher Reports&#8217; next Top 50 Draft Busts of all time (and still is) when Doc had &#8220;saved&#8221; him and thus successfully staged the single most gratuitous display of Los Angeles nepotism since the Will Smith/Jaden Smith dumpster fire of a movie entitled <em>After Earth.</em></p>
<p>While Doc Rivers had diligently navigated the Clippers through the muddy waters of the Donald Sterling Clippers era, he has let Chris Paul and Blake Griffin down by failing to provide them an adequate bench that&#8217;s capable of holding onto a lead while they rest.  Now Steve Ballmer, who just spent $2 billion on the Clippers last summer, may be in the uncomfortable position of asking Doc to step down from the General Manager role.  Chris Paul will once again suffer through another summer of pundits claiming he&#8217;s a choker, as he once again failed to make the conference finals; a feat he&#8217;s never accomplished in his career.  With Deandre Jordan entering free agency, where he&#8217;ll inevitably receive a max contract from Doc, the Clippers will now have less money to repair their broken roster.   Perhaps Doc will one day look back at his days with the Celtics and think &#8220;maybe I had it pretty good&#8221;, with Danny Ainge as the GM deflecting the majority of the blame for his team&#8217;s shortcomings.  When Doc triumphantly played his &#8220;get out of Boston Free card&#8221;, and thus become the President (coaching and GM duties) of the Los Angeles, he should have known that by upping his powers, he&#8217;d also be increasing the media&#8217;s ammo against him.</p>
<p>While Doc Rivers will forever have a fan in me, its hard to feel bad for him with this predicament on his hands.  He asked for the world, and with that, you inherit the all the world&#8217;s problems.</p>

<p>For the current Celtics players, this means nothing. A majority of the roster (10) never played alongside the two Boston stars. Former Celtics coach Doc Rivers is in L.A., and current coach Brad Stevens was making sure his players at Butler were going to study hall. Of those who did play alongside the Truth and the Big Ticket, Jared Sullinger was away recovering from back surgery most of his rookie season, Jeff Green doesn&#8217;t experience emotions, and Rajon Rondo is an a&#8211;hole (<a href="http://nesn.com/2014/01/rajon-rondo-kobe-bryant-share-mutual-admiration-built-around-both-being-expletives/" target="_blank">Kobe&#8217;s words</a>, not mine, though I tend to agree) who responded to questions about the return of KG and Pierce by saying, &#8220;Have you seen me tear before?&#8221;</p>
<p>Unlike the players, who reunited when the two teams played each other in Brooklyn earlier this season, Celtics fans will have their first reunion with two players who delivered the 17th banner to the TD Garden rafters. So while Rondo is a heartless bastard, I will be glued to my television set to see two franchise greats get honored on the parquet floor.</p>

When the timeout before the second quarter arrived, the Boston Celtics honored Doc Rivers with a special tribute video covering his nine years with the franchise that saw him usher in the Big Three Era, hoist the 2008 NBA Larry O&#8217;Brien trophy, and win over 400 games as a Celtics coach, third most in franchise history.</p>
<p>The video inspired a standing ovation from TD Garden crowd, who were on their feet before Rivers even looked up from his clipboard to see his own tribute. It was the second standing O of the night for Rivers, who was greeted to raucous applause, cheers, and handshakes galore when he walked out of the visitor&#8217;s tunnel.</p>

<p>Pierce will be on that suit and tie with a broken hand, but Garnett (or his corpse, more accurately) will be on the floor against his old teammates. (Terry is also injured, but again, who cares?) Rivers will be roaming the sideline at the Garden on Wednesday night, this time coaching point guard Chris Paul instead of the (also injured) Rajon Rondo, and opposite his replacement, wunderkind Brad Stevens.</p>
<p>The Celtics&#8217; visit to Brooklyn will be particularly intriguing, as the two teams have pulled some sort of Freaky Friday/Change-Up/Face-Off swap that finds Boston atop the Atlantic Division (10-12) while the Nets languish in second-to-last place (6-14). I was lucky enough to score tickets to the preseason clash between the diverging iterations of the Celtics at the Barclays Center.

<p>You can&#8217;t take the city out of the man, but you can take the man out of the city &#8211; at least for $3 million, that is. On July 26, not long after Celtics general manager Danny Ainge traded him to the Los Angeles Clippers for a first round pick, Doc Rivers sold his home in Boston for $3 million, <a href="http://greenstreet.weei.com/sports/boston/basketball/celtics/2013/09/17/doc-rivers-sells-his-boston-condo-for-3-million/" target="_blank">according to public records and WEEI</a>.</p>
