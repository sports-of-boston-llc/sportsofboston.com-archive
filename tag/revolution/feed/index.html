<p>The SuperDraft is limping along like a dog on three legs. It used to be the premiere event in the American soccer world. With piggy-backing the event with the National Soccer Coaches Association of America conference, it was an opportunity for the industry to get together and advance the entire operation. The draft used to be 6 rounds with similar traditions to other, more well known, American college drafts. MLS draft picks would get their team scarf, shake the commissioner’s hand, and have a day to remember.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2012/01/15/with-mls-superdraft-fading-into-obscurity-whats-next/">With MLS SuperDraft Fading Into Obscurity, What&#8217;s Next?</a> (434 words)</p>

So, does it really matter to New Englanders that the Revolution are looking for a new soccer-specific stadium?  It should.</p>
<p>All across Major League Soccer, teams are building soccer stadiums to create an intimate feel and drive in fans.  Now, the Revs are looking to get out of Foxboro and leave for a new area, closer to Boston.</p>
<h2>Moving on up</h2>
<p>The Patriots can afford to live in Foxboro.  It&#8217;s not hard for them to fill 68,000-plus seats every Sunday, not matter how ridiculous the prices are. Those who have rode the MBTA to Patriots games realize that it is for special events <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span> to Foxboro.  For many, including the MBTA, soccer is just not that special enough.  A move close to Boston might just be what the team needs.</p>
<p>The new home for the Revs could be Somerville.  Just north of Boston, the area could be a perfect fit for a soccer stadium.  For fans who can&#8217;t, or refuse to, drive to Foxboro, this is a short ride up the red line.  Considering that tickets range from $20-$40 a pop, that could be the most reasonable deal you&#8217;ll find around the city.  A family could afford to go to a professional sports game without mortgaging their house.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/09/10/new-stadium-means-new-possibilities-for-revolution/">New Stadium Means New Possibilities for Revolution</a> (713 words)</p>

As a result, NE is officially eliminated from the MLS Cup Playoffs. Game 1 was a 0-0 tie in New England, so with the Chicago win at home, they win the aggregate 3-0 and advance to the Eastern Conference Finals.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to <a href="http://web.mlsnet.com/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20081028&#038;content_id=200008&#038;vkey=news_mls&#038;fext=.jsp">MLSnet</a>, Taylor Twellman is now out indefinitely with concussion-related symptoms. These issues all stem from a punch to Taylor Twellman&#8217;s head from LA Galaxy goalie Steve Cronin during an August 30 collision, giving Twellman a concussion. While Twellman headed in a goal in the first half of that game, he collided with Cronin. Twellman remained in the game, skipped the next one, and went on to play the final eight games. However, it seems that something just hasn&#8217;t been right with Twellman ever since that hit to the head.</p>
<p>According to Revolution Vice President of Player Personnel Michael Burns:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Concussions, especially repeated concussions, are very dangerous and the most important thing for Taylor and his future &#8211; both off the field and on &#8211; is to get the rest he needs so he can return to normal as quickly as possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>This news does not bode well for one the Revolution&#8217;s finest players. Concussions and their aftermaths have ended many great professional sports careers. I&#8217;m reminded of Troy Aikman and Steve Young: both had their careers cut short due to lingering effects and potential dangers of playing contact sports after sustaining serious concussions.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s hope Twellman is okay and can fully recover from this painful accident.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This loss was pretty disappointing. The Revolution took a 1-0 lead early on with Taylor Twellman&#8217;s goal off the cross, but slowly deteriorated defensively. They were overtaken in the second half with two Houston Dynamo goals, losing 2-1. Maybe they were tired; maybe they were rusty. Credit Sports of Boston staffer Jeff, who said that the Revs the MLS-equivalent of the Buffalo Bills. The Bills have never won a Superbowl, but they went to the big game four consecutive years without tasting glory. The Revs have lost the last three MLS Cup games.</p>
<p>It still is nice that Boston teams have played in the last two professional sports championships. The next one coming up is the NFL&#8217;s Superbowl&#8230;will the Patriots be there to make it 3-for-3?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>MLS Cup: New England Revolution vs. Houston Dynamo<br />
Where: RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C.<br />
When: Sunday, November 18, at 12 p.m. EST<br />
What to watch for: <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/soccer/revolution/view.bg?articleid=1045573" target="_blank">Scouting report</a> By Kyle McCarthy, Boston Herald</strong></p>
<p>This is the second straight pro-sports championship with a Boston area team in it. Despite the fact that the Revs are even less popular than the Bruins (though that gap is certainly closing), this is another huge step in the right direction for Boston sports. If the Revs win, it could be 2-for-2 so far for Boston in Pro-Sports Championships for the 2007-2008 seasons. The Revs are no strangers to success (this is their third straight MLS Cup appearance). But, they have never won the big one, losing in heartbreaking fashion the last two times out.</p>
<p>Special Note: According to the Boston Globe&#8217;s Mike Reiss, <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/soccer/articles/2007/11/17/kraft_is_going_for_perfect_attendance/" target="_blank">Owner Robert Kraft will be in attendance</a> for BOTH the MLS Cup and the Patriots-Bills game Sunday night in Buffalo.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boston has already sent their second pro sports team to the Championship game. The New England Revolution won 1-0 Thursday night against the Chicago Fire and will play in their third-consecutive MLS Cup game. With all that success, the Revs still have never won an MLS Cup. Forward Taylor Twellman got them there by scoring the lone goal of the game in the 38th minute on an acrobatic bicycle kick.</p>
<p>The Fire had been on a 10-game (4-0-6) unbeaten streak. The Revs have never lost to the Fire in the playoffs, going 6-0. In fact, they&#8217;ve eliminated Chicago the last three years from postseason play. Now, the team awaits either the Kansas City Wizards or the Houston Dynamo, who beat the Revs last season to win it all.</p>
<p>Can the Revolution become the second Boston-area team to win it all in just three weeks time? Probably the fifth-most popular team in the area, the MLS Cup still bears watching.</p>
<p>MLS Cup: Revolution vs. Dynamo/Wizards<br />
Where: Washington, D.C.<br />

<p align="left">Boston sports has another new Eastern Conference contender. In case no one noticed, the New England Revolution advanced to their MLS-record sixth straight Eastern Conference finals Saturday night at Gillette Stadium. Forward Taylor Twellman scored the lone goal for the Revs in the 64th minute. Goalkeeper Matt Reis held the New York Red Bulls scoreless for the second straight game after recording four saves.</p>
<p>Twellman&#8217;s goal came soon after New York&#8217;s Juan Pablo Angel left the game with a concussion. Angel was not sure if he was going to make it back into the game, so no substitution was immediately made and the Red Bulls played with just 10 men for a number of minutes. The Revs capitalized when Twellman poked a Steve Ralston pass through Red Bulls goalkeeper Jon Conway for the 1-0 lead.</p>
