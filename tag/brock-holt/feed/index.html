<p>June is firmly in the rearview mirror for the suddenly wicked hot Boston Red Sox, and for at least 24 hours, doubts and criticisms have been silenced.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, the Red Sox needed only a one-run home run from Brock Holt to take the victory, but they graciously accepted a three run shot from Big Papi to provide all the run support that Rick Porcello would need. Porcello looked strong, earned his tenth straight win at home, and the Sox shut out the team with the best record in the majors. It was a feel good win, reminiscent of Octobers past, and indicative of Octobers future.</p>

It might be easy to say that it&#8217;s not surprising that Buchholz struggled against a Rangers team with the best record in the American League, especially with how Buchholz&#8217;s season has gone this year. But John Farrell used his faith in Buchholz to justify not bringing up a reliever from Pawtucket a night after <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8185&amp;position=P">Steven Wright</a> did not make it out of the fifth inning, and two nights after <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=3184&amp;position=P">David Price</a> didn&#8217;t make it out of the third. Most Red Sox fans already knew that faith was misguided, and were not surprised when Buchholz allowed the first six batters he faced to reach base, putting giving the Rangers an immediate lead they would not give up. Buchholz also walked more batters (5) than he struck out (3), further illustrating why he was demoted to the bullpen earlier in the season. Sadly the Red Sox find themselves thin on options as far as starting pitching is concerned, but there really is no reason to send Buchholz back out for another start. He has had more than his fair share of chances in Boston, and he has proven that the only thing he can be counted on to do is under-perform.</p>
<p>A few more notes from Sunday&#8217;s game:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=10607&amp;position=OF">Bryce Brentz</a> went 2-for-3 with a solo homer, the first of his Major League career. It will be interesting to see if the Red Sox try to get Brentz some playing time in Left Field going forward, as his bat could be starting to heat up. His main competition in Left, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=10700&amp;position=OF">Ryan LaMarre</a>, has done absolutely nothing with the bat since coming up from Pawtucket, so there should be plenty of playing time available for whoever is performing at the moment.</li>

In the beginning of the season, Blake Swihart was the starting catcher. Not too long after that he started to lose time to Ryan Hanigan and Christian Vazquez. Soon after Vazquez was thrown into the mix, Swihart was not seen again at the catching position and was dropped down to the AAA Pawtucket Red Sox.</p>
<p>For the majority of the season, Vazquez has been the everyday catcher with Hanigan catching a game or two here and there. But on June 5th Hanigan suffered a neck strain and was put on the 15 day DL. So most recently we have seen Vazquez sharing time at catcher with Sandy Leon, who is batting 10 for 16 (.625) on the season. Vazquez has seen significantly more time than any other catcher the Sox have had this year, but I question this. Christian is batting only .221 this year but is a pretty good defensive catcher with a strong arm. I just question why with a guy like Leon who has been hitting very well when he gets in, doesn&#8217;t see a little more playing time. I understand he&#8217;s only had 16 at bats, but when a guy is that hot coming into his first at bats of the season, you usually keep him in and see what he can do.</p>
<p>The biggest question the Sox face is who is going to be their left fielder. I feel like every time I watch them there&#8217;s someone different in left. The Sox started the season with Brock Holt as their starting left fielder. He played pretty much every day in left and performing at an average rate. But when he suffered a concussion on May 20th, he was put on the DL and hasn&#8217;t returned since. Holt is recovering from a concussion slower than normally but concussions are taken much more seriously now a days since we know so much more about the dangers of them. Holt is currently rehabbing with the Paw Sox and he is batting 3 for 6, with two doubles in two games. His return date to the Red Sox is uncertain but I can imagine when he get&#8217;s back he will be thrown right back into the lineup to see how he performs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when Holt was gone, left field saw action from mainly two different players; Chris Young and Blake Swihart. When Swihart was sent down to the minors, he decided that his best chance at playing for the Red Sox would be to switch to outfield and compete for the left field spot. Being the athletic and quick player he is, he transformed himself into a surprisingly well outfielder. Him and Chris Young would split time with each other in left. But Swihart was placed n the 15 day DL when he severely sprained his ankle running into a wall. So this leaves Chris Young alone, who has been playing left almost every day for the Sox and performing fairly well. He is batting .282 on the season and has had some big hits for the Sox this season. He has turned himself into a guy that we could see as an everyday player in the outfield.</p>
<p>But the thing is, when Holt finally comes back the Sox are going to put him back in left to compete with Young. Which is fair because he lost his starting spot due to injury. However it is not a given that Brock will just get his starting spot back because he was only batting .239 at the time of his injury, so it&#8217;s going to be a battle between the two. And when Swihart returns from his injury, who knows what&#8217;s going to happen because he was also hitting and playing fairly well in left.</p>
<p>Now the problem I have with all of this is that many teams don&#8217;t play well when there&#8217;s constant changes to the starting lineup. Most teams have the same guys at the same positions for the majority of the games. The Red Sox seem to have a different lineup every night. Whether its the catcher, the left fielder, the second baseman, or Ortiz has a day off; its always different. Having too many changes to a lineup too often can screw up the flow or momentum of a team. I blame a good amount of losses to this problem. John Farrell has made many Sox fans angry this year with his questionable choices in just about any decision he makes. As the season goes on, Farrell needs to make up his mind of who his every day players are because playing musical chairs with these guys all year just isn&#8217;t going to work.</p>

Jackie sits comfortably in the number three spot (over 937,000 votes) right behind Mike Trout and Lorenzo Cain. He is expected to be a starter in the All-Star game. Meanwhile Ortiz and Bogaerts both lead the AL with votes in their positions. But these are not the only three Sox players that may make the All-Star game this July.</p>
<h2>Potential Sox Players to Make ASG:</h2>
<ul>
<li>DH David Ortiz</li>
<li>SS Xander Bogaerts</li>
<li>OF Jackie Bradley Jr.</li>
<li>OF Mookie Betts</li>
<li>2B Dustin Pedroia</li>
<li>1B Hanley Ramirez</li>
<li>3B Travis Shaw</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sox have a chance a pretty good chance to bring a decent amount of players to the All-Star game, but it shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise to anyone. The Red Sox are the best hitting team in the MLB. They are first in runs (342), hits (610), doubles (152), total bases (1015), RBIs (329), AVG. (.290), OBP (.355), SLG (.482), and OPS (.837). They lead in almost every major offensive statistic so it wouldn&#8217;t be a shocker if half of the starting lineup ends up All-Stars this season. At one point during the season, six of the nine starting players were batting over .300 which is ridiculous. These guys are proving that they are a dominant force on the offensive side and they are really trying to make a name for themselves this year.</p>
<p>Now their pitching is another story. Everyone knows that Boston&#8217;s weakest part of their game is their pitching. But they do have some solid pitching from David Price, Rick Porcello, and Stephen Wright. If any pitchers from the Sox were going to make the All-Star game, I would have to say it would only be Porcello. He is 7-2 on the season with a 4.04 ERA. But I honestly don&#8217;t think Porcello will make it. If he had another win or two and had a lower ERA then yes he probably would make the team.</p>
<p>This time of year is looking very different from where the Sox were last year. The only player from Boston to make the All-Star game was Brock Holt. Now Holt has been hurt for a while with a concussion so we haven&#8217;t seen him so he&#8217;s out of the question for this year&#8217;s game. But to go from one All-Star to potentially four, five, maybe even six All-Stars in one year is a huge improvement.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how the voting ballots end up and who leads in each category. I want to see our players at the top of the food chain come July. But its up to <strong>YOU</strong> Boston fans to cast your vote and get our boys to the All-Star game. So head on over to MLB.com and vote! You can vote a total of 35 times total and five times a day. If I could vote 35 times a day I would but I also have no life so that&#8217;s just me.</p>
<p>Happy Voting</p>

Young was only in left field because Blake Swihart &#8220;severely sprained&#8221; his right ankle in a game against the Blue Jays, and Swihart was only in left because Brock Holt is on the disabled list with a concussion.</p>
<p>All three players are more than capable in the outfield. Swihart has exceptional speed for a utility man, Holt was an All-Star last year, and Young was a reliable starter for the Diamondbacks from 2006-2012 (Young enjoyed short stints playing for the A&#8217;s, Mets and Yankees from 2013-2015). With three viable options, who will emerge as the starting left fielder for the Red Sox?</p>
<p>Holt was originally the man during both spring training and the beginning of the season, but was not hitting as well as he was last year. Swihart was recalled from Triple-A Pawtucket when Holt went down with a concussion. Swihart provided added speed, hitting three triples in 19 games, and batting at .258. The Red Sox seemed to show faith in Swihart, and questions arose as to whether the Red Sox would be looking at Swihart for a long term option in left, or a trade chip in a potential deal.</p>

Yet once again Young found himself in the starting lineup with a right-hander on the mound in 2016. I&#8217;m sure John Farrell will come up with some ridiculous nonsense explaining why Young replaced <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=9345&amp;position=2B/3B/OF">Brock Holt</a> in Thursday&#8217;s lineup, but it will explain nothing and make no logical sense to anyone.</p>

Rather, it really is worth asking when the Red Sox are going to finally part with John Farrell as their manager and allow Torey Lovullo to take over. It is a question of when, not if, because Farrell is clearly on his last legs as manager. In fact, the Red Sox likely would have relieved Farrell of his duties in the offseason were it not for some extenuating circumstances with his health. Lovullo had several chances to interview for managerial roles in the offseason, but he stayed as bench coach because the Red Sox convinced him that he was next in line to take over the dugout. But regardless of who the replacement is, it is time for Farrell to go; he is clearly in over his head and the Red Sox need leadership from a manager who can win.</p>
<p>It really has been stunning how Farrell&#8217;s in-game managing has fallen off of a cliff in 2016. Not that he was a very good in-game manager in the first place, but there have been multiple occasions in 2016 where Farrell has left literally everyone in the ballpark wondering what he is thinking.</p>

As I’m driving home Sunday afternoon I tuned in to the second half of the Red Sox game in Detroit. I’m listening to Joe Castiglione when I realize I have no idea who is playing where defensively for the Red Sox. Joe then informs me that Jackie Bradley is in centerfield with Castillo and de Aza in the corner outfield slots, and the infield consists of Holt at third, Bogaerts at short, Josh Rutledge at second, and Travis Shaw at first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Initially I was slightly taken aback by some of the names out there, but when I thought about it a little more I realized it’s not a bad thing at all that these guys are getting reps. Sure, I would love to see the Sox in a pennant race right now with the star players like Pedroia and Ortiz leading the way, but given the circumstances of this season I think the rest of the season is a great opportunity to get the younger, unproven players a chance to showcase their talents. Whether or not they are ultimately on the Red Sox roster in a few years, these guys could important pieces to the puzzle. It’s a whole new look out there for the remainder of 2015, but I don’t hate it. Here is why:</span></p>
<p><strong>Jackie Bradley Jr.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On Sunday JBJ had maybe the best game of his career. He went two for three with 5 RBI and made an absolutely stunning catch near the center field wall with his back to home plate. This is a guy that many Red Sox fans have written off and moved on from, and his struggles at the MLB level are well noted. At this point he probably feels like it is him against the city of Boston. He is trying to silence the doubters and prove that he can hit. I have to say that I’m a believer and it&#8217;s not just because he had one outstanding game. I have been a supporter ever since he took the time to shake my hand in passing as a spectator at a Sea Dogs game last year. Sometimes its the little things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jackie Bradley Jr. is an elite defensive outfielder. For some evidence take a peek at this</span><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dp8qJAonaE"> <span style="font-weight: 400">video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. If you want the short version you can skip ahead to 4:08 and JBJ will showcase all his abilities in one single play. He makes tough plays look easy (2:47), has a tremendous arm strength (0:58), and can make the spectacular diving play (1:19). Defensively he is absolutely ready to play in MLB and that his bat is the only question mark. The way he plays the outfield he can be an asset to a team if he hits anywhere above .260, his defensive abilities are that superb. Even if the Red Sox front office decides to give up on him and move on, Jackie Bradley Jr. has an MLB career in his future. It is just a matter of time for him to get comfortable at the new level. I’m hoping he hits to the front office’s satisfaction the rest of this year season because I would love to see him in the Red Sox uniform for years to come.</span></p>
<p><strong>Rusney Castillo</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rusney was playing right field last night and had a solid offensive day. I am glad to see him getting an opportunity to play for the Red Sox because I think it is the only way he is going to get comfortable in professional baseball. There is no question he is a very talented player and it is only a matter of time before he figures it out. I just think he has felt the pressure of playing in Boston and the expectations associated with a big money deal like the one he signed. The rest of the 2015 season presents Rusney a tremendous opportunity and he has a real chance to earn the Red Sox’ trust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I personally would prefer to see Rusney in left field. As Brendan</span><a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/08/10/rusney-castillos-open-audition/#more-85322"> <span style="font-weight: 400">eluded to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a couple of days ago Rusney’s defense in nothing to write home about, but Castillo could learn to master the Green Monster similar to Manny Ramirez back in the day (Say what you want about Manny’s overall defense but he did know what he was doing when the ball rebounded off of the Monster). In last night’s game against the Marlins we saw JBJ in left and Rusney in right. I would prefer to see JBJ in center with Mookie in right and Castillo in left, but when it boils down to it any combination of those three players is a scary outfield to opposing teams. No matter what happens I hope both of these guys stay on the Red Sox for the next few years because they have the ability to help a championship caliber baseball team.</span></p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rest of 2015 still has plenty to offer diehard Red Sox fans. Although the losses will likely continue to pile up it is the opportunity that has been presented to the inexperienced players that offers promise. If the Red Sox were in the middle of a pennant race Castillo and JBJ would not get the same chances they’re now seeing on a daily basis. Instead the Red Sox are getting prepared for 2016 and beyond. Imagine if both Rusney and Bradley Jr. perform well enough that the 2016 outfield features both of them with Mookie… That is a good outfield. Now all we need in the remainder of 2015 is Joe Kelly in the bullpen and for Hanley to play some first base and the Red Sox 2016 campaign would be off to great start.</span></p>
