(AP Photo/Don Wright, File)" ></a><p>Enough is enough.</p>
<p>After an NFL weekend that featured an unusually high number of concussions, talking heads and media types have beaten the story into the ground, and managed to vilify a few players in the process.</p>
<p>There is no question the hit by Brandon Meriweather was illegal and has no place on the football field, but what about the hits by James Harrison and Dunta Robinson? Those hits were within the rules of the game.</p>
<p>Harrison&#8217;s helmet-to-helmet contact with Josh Cribbs was perfectly legal, because Cribbs was a running back on the play, not a defenseless receiver. The only reason it&#8217;s getting attention as a &#8220;dirty hit&#8221;  is that a concussion resulted from it.</p>
<p>And what was Harrison supposed to do about Mohamed Massoquoi bending over at the last split second? How is he supposed to make an adjustment?</p>
<p>He isn&#8217;t, because he can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>And why was Massaquoi running through zone coverage instead of sitting down in a soft area like he was supposed to?</p>
<p>Why did Colt McCoy stare down Massaquoi for five seconds before he threw him the ball, and lead him unknowingly into the path of an oncoming linebacker?</p>
<p>These are the questions that need to be asked before the NFL punishes a player with a $75,000 fine for simply doing his job, within the rules of the game.</p>
<p>Can we please agree that the majority of the sports world is guilty of a big overreaction?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unfortunate that concussions resulted from the hits delivered by Robinson and Harrison. Certainly concussions are something that the league needs to take very seriously. But to some extent aren&#8217;t concussions an inevitability in today&#8217;s NFL? Regardless of whether or not a player leads with his helmet?</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that you can say every time there&#8217;s one of those hits and  a guy gets knocked out that a guy should be suspended for it. I just  don&#8217;t think we can be that black and white,&#8221; said Steelers owner Art Rooney.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hits similar to those that led to four concussions on Sunday have happened on NFL fields in the past, and they will continue to happen in the future. There’s no getting around this simple fact. Unless you want to completely change the game as we know it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This game always been violent,&#8221; said Redskins running back Clinton Portis.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;People like to see the mano a mano side of things. Like to see people collide. That&#8217;s what makes football.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree Clinton.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/10/21/nfl-media-vilifying-meriweather-robinson-harrison-over-concussions/">NFL, Media Vilifying Meriweather, Robinson, Harrison Over Concussions</a> (733 words)</p>

<p>Matthew Slater fumbled a kickoff deep in Patriots territory, which led to a touchdown pass from Ben Roethlisberger to Hines Ward. Matt Cassel lost a fumble on the next Patriots play from scrimmage thanks to horrible blocking from Matt Light (which led to a James Harrison sack and forced fumble). Cassel lost another fumble later in the quarter on a very similar play with the same outcome. Both fumbles only resulted in three points, but the damage was done.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2008/11/30/turnovers-kill-patriots-in-loss-to-steelers/">Turnovers Kill Patriots in Loss to Steelers</a> (319 words)</p>
