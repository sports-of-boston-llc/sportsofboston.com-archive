The Red Sox were coming off of an 8-1 homestand that saw them move into second place in the AL East, tied with Tampa Bay and just a half-game behind New York. On the hill for the Red Sox was <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=28487">Jon Lester</a>, who was 8-0 in his last 11 starts coming into this game. He faced Rockies right-hander <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=30147">Jhoulys Chacin</a>, who had lost his most recent start despite giving up just two earned runs in five innings of work. No Boston player had ever faced Chacin before, so adjusting to his pitches mid-game would be essential.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Red Sox never were able to adjust to Chacin appropriately, as he did an excellent job of stifling Boston hitters in his 6.2 innings of work. He allowed no earned runs while striking out five. The Red Sox had few chances to score, and they failed to take advantage in those situations. In the top of the third, the Red Sox loaded the bases with two outs. <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=5007">Victor Martinez</a>, however, grounded out to kill the scoring opportunity. The Rockies then scored in the bottom of the fifth on a <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=3709">Todd Helton </a>(2-4, RBI, run scored) single.</p>
<p>The Red Sox came back and loaded the bases in the top of the seventh, but once again the opportunity proved fruitless, as pinch-hitter <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=3748">David Ortiz</a> grounded out. The 1-0 Colorado lead continued until the eighth inning, when <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=6350">Ryan Spilborghs</a>, with two men on, hit a ball towards shortstop <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=5217">Marco Scutaro</a>. The ball bounced over his head, and an insurance run came around to score. The Red Sox got one run back on an <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=3878">Adrian Beltre</a> double and <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=3331">Mike Cameron</a> RBI single, but the game ended on a grounder from <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=3972">Mike Lowell</a> with the tying run on first base. <strong>The final score: Rockies 2, Boston 1.</strong> Chacin picked up the win, Lester the hard-luck loss, and <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=5829">Matt Belisle</a> picked up his first save of the season.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/06/23/rockies-pitchers-frustrate-red-sox-hitters-all-night-long/">Rockies Pitchers Frustrate Red Sox Hitters All Night Long</a> (527 words)</p>
