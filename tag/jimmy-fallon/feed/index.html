				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Late Night host Jimmy Fallon wants to know which sports franchise has the most dedicated fans. So? Well, the reason I&#8217;m letting you, the reader, know is that the Red Sox are one of the teams on the list. So are the Yankees.</p>
<p>That brings me to my second point: if you care enough to make change, you need to vote early and often for the Red Sox. I cast my ballot, and much to my dismay, the Sox are currently only carrying 3% of the vote. The Yankees are at 2%. So who&#8217;s currently in the lead? The New Orleans Saints at a whopping 61%! They just won the Super Bowl and morale is high, so maybe that is why they&#8217;re leading.</p>
<p>You can still vote now, and if you don&#8217;t want the Red Sox embarrassed, all you have to do is <a href="http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/blogs/2010/04/which-sports-franchise-has-the-most-dedicated-superfans/">click and vote here</a>.</p>

<p>Look, I loved the guy when he was wearing a Red Sox uniform. When I played wiffleball, I would mimic his obsessive compulsive batting glove routine, just like every other kid (I still do, because admit it, it’s fun.) Nomar was idolized in this region. He was our ambassador to the outside world. <a href="http://cache.boston.com/images/bostondirtdogs//Headline_Archives/APP_JF_maryellenmatthews_nb.jpg" target="_blank">Jimmy Fallon (badly I may add) played a character on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> based on our love for this guy</a> (which is when I first started hating Jimmy Fallon, a passion (a) I carry on to this day and (b) can proudly say I had long before it was cool to hate Jimmy Fallon). Even Ted Williams, the greatest hitter ever, said that Nomar would be the one to inherit his throne. Hell, for all we know, Teddy Ballgame promised Nomar a spot in the freezer next to him when his life was over.</p>
<p>Nomar marked the resurgence of Red Sox Nation. He was our fearless leader, and like my fellow writer Matt, <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/03/10/welcome-back-nomar/" target="_blank">who posted a nice piece about Nomar retiring as a Red Sox</a>, I was happy to hear about this re-sign/retire gesture. In a sports news cycle saturated with paternity suites and vehicular manslaughter cases, reading a story like this is more than welcome in my book.</p>
<p>But amidst this touchy-feely story, it seems we’re kind of forgetting a few things, or at the very least, quickly glancing them over. And it&#8217;s this—we, meaning most of us in Boston and New England (fans and media alike) were more than happy to see Nomar shipped out back in 2004.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/03/11/nomar-retiring-with-red-sox-isnt-all-rainbows-and-happy-endings/">Nomar Retiring with Red Sox Isn&#8217;t All Rainbows and Happy Endings</a> (653 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David Ortiz had a pretty rough season last year for the Red Sox. Some suggest his career may be over, or that he may have never had a legitimate career at all (due to the steroid rumors), while others believe he may just be on the Back 9. Some, <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/01/07/what-can-we-expect-from-david-ortiz-in-2010/">like SoB&#8217;s Mike Sharkey</a>, allege that Ortiz might have one more Big Papi-ish year in him as he plays for the final contract of his career. </p>
<p>While he looks ahead to 2010, he took a break from his offseason training program to appear on &#8220;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&#8221; on Monday night. Not only did Big Papi sit down for an interview, but he also gave Jimmy a batting lesson. How do eggs teach you to be better at baseball? Watch the clips to find out!(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/01/12/david-ortiz-on-jimmy-fallon/">David Ortiz on Jimmy Fallon</a> (13 words)</p>
