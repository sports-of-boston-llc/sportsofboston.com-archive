The world he writes about, Discworld, is a flat world borne through space on the backs of four elephants, who are in turn borne through space on the shell of a giant turtle. It is a world filled with wizards, witches, trolls, dwarves, and other fantastical elements. Perhaps in preparation for the upcoming World Cup, Pratchett&#8217;s newest &#8220;Discworld&#8221; novel, <em>Unseen Academicals</em>, is about the first organized soccer match in the modern of history of Ankh-Morpork, principal city of the Disc (based off of London).</p>
<p>The state that football finds itself in at the book&#8217;s inception is not a good one. The games are played primarily in back alleys and on the streets. Play is amateurish and violent, with little in the way of organization or even real talent. And the crowd, collectively known as &#8220;The Shove,&#8221; is just as violent as the players or worse, with frequent rioting and even the occasional death.</p>
<p>Worst of all, the crowds seems reluctant to any form of change for the better. &#8220;It was something that people themselves had put together and rickety and stupid though it was, it was theirs&#8221; (241). Despite this all, it is beloved by the citizens of Ankh-Morpork, and Pratchett has a good enough understanding of sports fandom to understand why: &#8220;&#8216;The noise, the crowds, the chanting, oh the chanting! It becomes a second blood! The unison! To not be alone! To be not just one but one and all, of one mind, of one purpose (121)!'&#8221; This unity lies at the heart of community sports, and any sports fan should find themselves nodding along with the explanation of why a sport as violent and poorly organized still gathers a crowd so devoted as to engender violence.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/06/02/book-review-unseen-academicals-wizards-playing-soccer/">Book Review: Unseen Academicals &#8211; Wizards Playing Soccer</a> (462 words)</p>
