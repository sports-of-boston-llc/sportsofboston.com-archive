<p>After the Cavs were blown off the floor in game four, I along with the rest of the country had pronounced them dead. I had begun to write LeBron&#8217;s eulogy, complete with a bevy of excuses and narcissistic one-liners that he would have loved. I popped &#8220;The Godfather&#8221; in the DVD player and was prepared to watch it six times in succession as a tribute to LBJ&#8217;s willpower and mental fortitude. I even sent flowers to LeBron&#8217;s mom and step-dad, Delonte West.</p>
<p>The series was all but over. You could see it in the body language of every Cavs player. They were ready to throw in the towel and fire up the old LeBron excuse train. But then, the King finally lived up to his name. Kyrie got the party started with a tremendous individual performance in game five, and LeBron finally woke up and remembered that he is the single most unguardable player in the history of basketball.</p>
<p>No one, not even Air Jordan himself, has ever had a performance quite like King James had in these finals. I mean the guy led both teams in points, assists, rebounds, steals, and blocks for the series for christ&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>He carried the Cavs and the city of Cleveland to their first title in 52 years, and he did it against a team that was destined to be one of, if not thee greatest team of all-time. Of course, the epic comeback would not have been possible without one of the biggest collapses in the history of modern athletics. The Warriors were completely out of sync down the stretch last night, hoisting up horrible shots and hoping that Steph or Klay (The Trash Bros) would bail them out with a late prayer. Their third best player in Draymond Green outplayed both Steph and Klay for most of the series, and that can&#8217;t be the case if you want to beat a player of Bron Bron&#8217;s caliber on the big stage.</p>
<p>As much as I hate to say it, if LeBron cracked under pressure like Steph did in this series, the media would be absolutely DESTROYING him right now. That&#8217;s the price you pay when you build yourself up as one of the biggest front runners of all-time. When you lose, the blame falls squarely on your broad, freakishly muscular shoulders. But when you win, and dominate the way that LeBron did in this series, then all of the praise and credit if yours and yours alone.</p>
<p>Whatever narrative you want to write about LeBron and his career is now open for debate. The comparisons between he and Jordan that seemed all but dead just a few short months ago are now back on the table. That&#8217;s how impressive LBJ&#8217;s finals were.</p>
<p>So where does LeBron go from here? He did what he set out to do and won a championship for his city, and he did so as the best player on the floor by  wide, wide margin. Why stay? Cleveland is a dump to begin with and I&#8217;ve got to imagine that it&#8217;s burned to the ground after last night&#8217;s celebrations. Whatever he does, his legacy is now set in stone.</p>
<p>I hate you LeBron James, and I always will. Your pompous, self-absorbed demeanor will never allow me to truly respect your greatness. But finally, I can say without sarcasm, that I truly, truly respect you.</p>
<p>PS- Someone check on J.R. Smith. Like right now.</p>

I don&#8217;t think anyone, including the Warriors, thought that OKC would put up this kind of a fight against the defending world champs. Up three games to one, the Thunder were in the driver&#8217;s seat. Russell Westbrook couldn&#8217;t be stopped and was looking like the best player on the court. Kevin Durant was playing sound, efficient basketball on both ends of the floor, and the supporting cast, particularly Steven Adams, seemed to be making all the little plays that make the difference in a tight series.</p>
<p>But then, Steph Curry happened. Klay Thompson woke up from his coma and dropped 19 in the fourth quarter to force game seven. When you get a great team like the Warriors on their heels, you have to go for the jugular. Can&#8217;t let Steph and Klay hang around long enough to get hot. The role players, including Anderson Varejao, who apparently still plays basketball, and others did their part down the stretch. Oracle was LIT. Steph was crossing anyone who dared to guard him and making it look more effortless than ever. When I think about Steph Curry twenty years from now, this is the game I&#8217;ll remember. The way he, the Thunder, and everyone watching knew the ball was going in the second he came off of the screen.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got to be honest, I was starting to grow tired of all the Golden State love. ESPN constantly shoving them down our throats and social media losing their minds every time Steph hits a three. But the Warriors are just too much fun. One of the all-time great teams in sports and last night showed just what kind of resolve they really have. Can&#8217;t wait to watch them take down King James once again in the finals. I enjoy watching LeBron James lose just as much as I enjoy watching my teams win. If that&#8217;s wrong, then I don&#8217;t want to be right.</p>
<p>PS- Hey KD, you know who doesn&#8217;t play in the Western Conference with the big bad Warriors and Spurs? The Celtics. Just saying&#8230;</p>

(Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)" ></a><p>I have already stated that I am not sure is DeMarcus Cousins would fit in Boston but I would still take the risk depending on the package Sacramento is looking for. There are a number of things general manager Danny Ainge could do to get Cousins or some other star, given the cap situation and the number of tradable pieces on the books. Quite possibly the best, and least talked about of these assets is the two large trade exceptions Boston has from Tayshaun Prince and Rajon Rondo. These could be huge in a scenario where Ainge goes all in for next season. If he decides to simply use all cap room, trade exceptions, trades and draft picks between now and next year’s trade deadline, there are endless possibilities &#8212; one of which is figuring out a way to bring the Kings big man to Boston.</p>
<p>Cousins is on a great contract, through 2017-18, plays well on both ends of the court (when he wants to) and is possibly the most frightening low post threat in the league. That all sounds great but that last part is what worries me. In an increasingly perimeter oriented league, maybe a guy who plays almost exclusively inside isn’t worth as much as one that can stretch the floor. So there are two questions that need to be answered: Is DeMarcus Cousins worth trading for? And if so, how do you do it?(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/06/09/using-trade-exceptions-and-bringing-boogie-to-boston/">Using Trade Exceptions and Bringing Boogie to Boston</a> (1,453 words)</p>

Since 2000, its major sports teams (Patriots, Celtics, Red Sox and Bruins) have combined to win nine championships. The Celtics though, despite being the one of the two most accomplished and winningest NBA teams in history, have only contributed one. On top of this, after losing three future Hall of Famers over the course of two years, it seemed like the team was going to be closer to the lottery than the Finals for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>It seems to me though, that a Championship contender is not that far off. With a great coach in Brad Stevens, a top general manager in Danny Ainge, a young, cheap backcourt locked up for the next three years and loads of cap space coming, this is a team that could be hoisting the Larry O’Brien Trophy sooner than most would think. I am going to take a look at the current roster, free agents and the upcoming draft to determine the likelihood that this team could contend in a weak Eastern Conference next season.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/06/05/how-to-build-the-next-celtics-dynasty/">How to Build the Next Celtics Dynasty</a> (1,652 words)</p>

<p>Social media and members of the NBA family alike, have voiced disapproval at the selection process, pointing primarily to the appointment of Kobe Bryant&#8217;s role as a starter, despite his civilian-level shooting percentage of 37%.  While Kobe Bryant has since torn his rotator cuff and is likely out for the remainder of the season, the point still stands; the current process is a popularity vote that has little to do with each player&#8217;s current production in the NBA.</p>
<p>Perhaps most outspoken of the voting processes&#8217; opponents is Mavericks&#8217; owner Mark Cuban.  Cuban sees the overall lack in interest from fans to voting as perhaps the biggest reason for its flaws.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/01/25/nba-all-star-game-starters-announced-illustrate-flawed-selection-process/">NBA All-Star Game Starters Announced, Illustrate Flawed Selection Process</a> (435 words)</p>
