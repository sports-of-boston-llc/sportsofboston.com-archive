It assumes a 16 team mixed-league <strong>keeper</strong> format with a standard 5&#215;5 scoring system and a 22 man roster with the following positional requirements: C (1), 1B (1), 2B (1), 3B (1), SS (1), CI (1), MI (1), OF (3), UT (3), SP (5), RP (4). </span><span style="font-weight: 400">All statistical information is referenced from FanGraphs.com.</span></p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Paul Goldschmidt (ARI)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not much needs to be said here. Goldy is arguably the most valuable fantasy player and is only 28 years old. It will be fun to watch him lead a Diamondbacks team with World Series aspirations.</span></p>
<p><b>Anthony Rizzo (CHC), Jose Abreu (CWS)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400">26 </span><span style="font-weight: 400">year old </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Florida </span><span style="font-weight: 400">native is another stud. He is the cornerstone of what may become the Cubs team to break the Curse, and will hit in the middle of their lineup for the foreseeable future. Don’t expect the 17 stolen bases he had in 2015, but he is a high caliber talent worthy of your first round draft selection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jose Abreu gets included in this tier because at 29 he is reaching his prime as a first baseman, and in his only two seasons has hit 30 home runs with 100 RBI. This production may not rise any more, but is an absolute asset to fantasy owners as he reaches his prime as a first-basemen.</span></p>
<p><b>Miguel Cabrera (DET), Edwin Encarnacion (TOR)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s hard to argue that Miggy is not the best hitter in baseball, but what separated him from the likes of Rizzo and Goldschmidt is the injury risk. Cabrera is 33 years old and has had trouble staying healthy in recent years. A luxury when he stays on the field but his ability to do so has become a concern. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Edwin Encarnacion is a similar case. Offers four category production when healthy but struggled with some wrist and hand injuries and is not getting any younger. </span></p>
<p><b>Joey Votto (CIN), Eric Hosmer (KC)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Votto is a model of consistency. He is a pure line drive hitter that reaps the benefits of Great American Ballpark and it seems like he is always on-base thanks to his 21% walk rate. His value is degraded slightly by the lousy Cincinnati lineup this season but he is still a fantasy asset. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hosmer is a player on the rise after his performance last season and is hitting the stride of his career. His steady contact and line drive rates have helped him maintain a good average and there remains some untapped power potential. </span></p>
<p><b>Miguel Sano (MIN), Freddie Freeman (ATL), David Ortiz (BOS)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sano is oozing upside despite the fact that he has yet to manage MLB pitching enough to maintain a decent average, He has keeper value rooted in the elite raw power and young age, but he needs to find a position to play on the diamond so that he does not have assume a strictly DH role. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Freddie Freeman will have the unfortunate duty of hitting in the middle of the Braves lineup this year. Pitchers are likely to pitch around him and there no one behind him likely to produce on a consistent basis. He is  really good line drive hitter entering his prime but the problem is his supporting cast. A keeper, but he will not be able to do it all himself this season. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last here is Big Papi. I acknowledge this is a generous ranking</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> in his last year before retirement, but a lock to hit 30 HR with 100 RBI in his send-off tour, he deserves nothing less.</span></p>
<p><b>Adrian Gonzalez (LAD), Prince Fielder (TEX), Kendrys Morales (KC)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Adrian Gonzalez is a pure line-drive hitter that stabilizes the middle of the Dodgers lineup. Unfortunately he is on the wrong side of 30 and although a proven fantasy asset he does not offer the same potential as other options. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Prince Fielder is in a similar situation. He bounced back nicely at the start of last season from neck surgery but failed to maintain that performance in the second half of the season. He can hit when he stays healthy but, like Gonzalez, his best years are behind him. </span></p>
<p>Morales is aging too. Now 33 he has seen his peak years in the rear-view mirror. He remains a is a solid utility option that can boost the HR, RBI categories while maintaining a respectable batting average.</p>
<p><b>Albert Pujols (LAA), Brandon Belt (SF), Carlos Santana (CLE)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pujols will provide power and power. His line drive rate was its lowest in five years last season (16%) as he hit for an abysmal .244 batting average. He did hit 40 home runs last year, but at 36 years old he is no longer the machine he once was. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Belt is the youngest of the group that is a contributor when on the field. But concussion problems are well-noted and make him a wild card at this point. This is confusing option for fantasy owners. A line drive hitter with some contact issues at timees, he offers surplus value if he falls in the draft because of health concerns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The last on the list is Carlos Santana. He fits a power profile with a lack of batting average but supports his value with very good OBP and the opportunity he will have to drive in runs from his spot in the Indians&#8217; lineup. </span></p>
<p><b>Mark Teixeira (NYY), Evan Gattis (HOU)</b></p>
<p>I am biased against anyone on the Yankees roster but Teixeira deserves a spot on here because he&#8217;s a proven veteran that benefits from playing in the new Yankee Stadium. If he can stay on the field he offers owners a nice value pick opportunity.</p>
<p>Evan Gattis&#8217; fantasy value has dropped because of his status as a pure designated hitter with the Astros but his offensive output seemed to benefit from the change. One concern is a sports hernia that will delay his 2016 debut until after opening day. He will hurt a team&#8217;s OBP but make significant contributions in the home-run and RBI categories.</p>
<p><b>Ryan Zimmerman (WAS), Lucas Duda (NYM)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Zimmerman can find a way to stay healthy he will serve as a run producer in the heart of the National&#8217;s lineup this season. The problem is his health; he hasn’t logged over 400 at-bats in either of the last two season so it’s hard to anticipate a valuable season from him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Teixeria&#8217;s New York City counterpart, Luca Duda, is a pure power hitter. He won&#8217;t hit for an average but has shown promising improvement in his OBP over the last few years and is a mid-level fantasy option </span></p>
<hr />
<p>This class of first basemen offer owners a wide range of quality options depending on the roster you have put together. At the top are bonafide fantasy baseball studs that can anchor a team through the season, and are absolute keepers worthy of top draft picks. If you miss out on those guys and get your fantasy star at another position there are other first basemen that make solid contributions. As expected, most of these guys will produce for power categories like home runs, and RBI and can provide decent production in a utility role for almost any team.</p>
<p><strong>Fishing for Prospects: A.J. Reed (HOU)</strong></p>
<p>If you only take only one thing away from this entire series, let it be this name because A.J. Reed is poised for stardom. He was selected 42nd overall selection in the 2014 MLB draft after a stunning season at Kentucky that culminated in the Golden Spikes Award. That season he led the nations in home runs with 23 with a .336 batting average, and also contributed a 12-2 record on the mound with a 2.09 ERA and 71 strikeouts. The Astros player development staff decided to commit to Reed as a hitter and he thrived in the Class A Advanced California league before earning a promotion to Double-A in the second half of the season. Headed in to 2015 the Astros have other options ahead of him, but depending on how spring training unfolds Reed may get a shot to prove himself with the major league club as soon as this season.</p>

(Boston Herald)" ></a><p>Mercifully, the New England Patriots are in the win column, and the 2014 season for the Boston Red Sox is in its final weeks.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Patriots only play once a week (hopefully more like <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2014/09/15/notes-and-observations-week-2-defense-shines-as-patriots-defeat-vikings-30-7/" target="_blank">Week 2</a> than <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2014/09/07/rough-second-half-costs-patriots-in-33-20-loss-in-miami/" target="_blank">Week 1</a>), and there still isn&#8217;t any Celtics basketball or Bruins hockey to fill the space between each Sunday.</p>
<p>So even though I gave up on the Red Sox eons ago, I&#8217;m going to put myself through an exercise in futility and try to come up with reasons from here on out for why to watch the Red Sox in their final September death throes. If only because answering the question, &#8220;Is there a reason to watch the Red Sox anymore?&#8221; with a singular &#8220;No&#8221; would make for an unsatisfactory (albeit accurate) post.</p>
<p>Fittingly, we&#8217;ll start with the best (only?) reason of all to watch the Red Sox for the remainder of this wretched season: the unknown free agent out of Cuba, Rusney Castillo, who will make his debut on Wednesday night against the Pittsburgh Pirates.</p>

<p>What does this mean for the team? For starters, it&#8217;s uncertain at this time when Castillo will arrive with the team. But things are looking bleak for <strong>Jackie Bradley Jr</strong>, who was optioned to Pawtucket last week.

In recent years, usually a group of Boston players would make the trip, including regulars like David Ortiz and Dustin Pedroia. Yet after fans and players gave their opinions on who will get to make the trip to Minnesota next week, Ortiz along with other Sox candidates such as Koji Uehara and Brock Holt were nowhere to be found.</p>
<h2>Offensive struggles, competition keep Ortiz off roster</h2>
<p>After finally getting the Red Sox to bite on a two-year contract, Ortiz has put up his worst numbers at the plate since 2009 when it seemed like his career was over. While there&#8217;s no doubt he remains the most dangerous hitter in the Sox lineup with an impressive 19 home runs before the break, Big Papi has been hitting closer to .250 than .300 for the majority of the year.</p>
<p>Additionally, the competition in the American League at the designated hitter position actually exists this season. Nelson Cruz has played DH in about half of his games this year for Baltimore and made the roster as a starter and earned his position on the team from the fan vote, even after recently dealing with his PED suspension.</p>
<p>The American League has four potential backup first basemen; Jose Abreu, Edwin Encarnacion, Victor Martinez, and Brandon Moss. Of the bunch, Moss&#8217;s numbers are most comparable with Ortiz, but at the end of the day the 2014 season has belonged to Oakland, and they will be well-represented at the game with six All-Stars. Ortiz would be the first to admit that he doesn&#8217;t belong in this mix of players, and will probably benefit from a few days off for a change.</p>
<h2>Uehara will be first alternate roster option</h2>
<p>Closer Koji Uehara seemed like a serious candidate for the All-Star Game, and he is the first option to replace a pitcher who is injured or ineligible to pitch, so he&#8217;s certain to end up joining the roster eventually. The 39-year old has been close to flawless in 41.2 innings this season, striking out 52 batters while walking just six and maintaining a 1.30 ERA.</p>
<p>When comparing Uehara to the other right-handed relievers elected, it does seem like he should have been initially chosen. Kansas City Royals reliever Greg Holland has been terrific but less effective than the automatic Uehara, who deserved his spot on the roster, especially since the Royals are already represented with both Salvador Perez and Alex Gordon attending.</p>
<h2>Unproven Holt doesn&#8217;t belong in Minnesota</h2>
<p>As for Brock Holt, the super utility rookie extraordinaire has played unbelievable on both sides of the ball this season, by making the loss of Jacoby Ellsbury at the top of the batting order relatively painless and by playing nearly every position in the field. While his numbers are crawling back down to Earth, only playing in 55 games to this point in the season prevents Holt from being realistically considered, especially given how little his great play has impacted the success of the Red Sox.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Red Sox are going nowhere in 2014. The bridge is in full effect as the team and the media focuses more on the upcoming Jon Lester free agency than the actual standings. It is unusual for the Red Sox to be out of a playoff race before the All-Star Break, especially for the defending World Series champions, but the future remains bright and it&#8217;s fair to expect multiple All-Stars from this promising franchise in the years to come.</p>
