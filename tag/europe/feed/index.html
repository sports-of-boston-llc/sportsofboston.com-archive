The apocalyptic event that will inevitably come crashing down on the Celtics is dawning on the organization. It’s something that nobody wants, but everyone knows it has to come at one time or another. A nation’s leader, loved by his people will be sailing off into the sunset, or in this case somewhere in Europe, leaving the masses behind to fend for themselves. It had to happen eventually; Paul Pierce has announced this is his final contract. <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/extras/celtics_blog/2010/08/after_nba_pierc.html">Julian Benbow of Boston.com</a> reports that Pierce has stated he will retire a Celtic after his current contract, and most likely move to Europe to live and play basketball. It’s a couple of years from now, so maybe we should just try to enjoy watching the Celtics go for another title. It won’t be that bad….right?</p>
<p>At some point, Boston’s “Big Three” will be no more. The transition will take place, and hopefully for Bostonians who enjoy basketball, it’s as smooth as can be. But at least the organization, and we as fans, now have a timetable that we can work with to prepare ourselves, which is three to four years. Make it two years if you’re under the assumption that Ray Allen isn’t coming back after his contract, which you probably should be. Ray Allen will probably retire or leave first, and Kevin Garnett won’t be far behind Pierce, but make no mistake; this is Pierce’s team. He’s the captain, and he deserves that title more than anyone on the Celtics, hands down, no argument. He stayed green through the good times, the tolerable times, and the very worst of times, which seemed to never end at some points. Pierce will be the hardest to see leave, and will undoubtedly leave many questions behind with his departure. But how bad could it really, really be?(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/08/24/its-the-truth-pierce-retiring-after-current-contract/">It&#8217;s the Truth: Pierce Retiring After Current Contract</a> (356 words)</p>

Sports</a>, reports are surfacing that 32-year-old fan favorite Brian Scalabrine maybe be saying farewell not just to the Celtics, but the entire NBA, to the dismay of many Celtic fans. According to reports, there is a possibility that Scal could be on his way to signing a deal with a European basketball team.  It’s no surprise that the market isn’t very demanding for a 32-year-old veteran who averaged 1.9 points and 0.9 rebounds in 2009. Those stats come from playing in only 52 regular season games, with an average on 9.1 minutes of playing time. Nevertheless, it seems the offers haven’t been quite what Brian Scalabrine is looking for, and now there’s a chance he could take his talents to the other side of the world in the next step of his basketball career.</p>
<h2>What do the Celtics Lose?</h2>
<p>It’s regrettable to say, because Scalabrine seems like such a good guy, but if he were to go to Europe this coming season, there’s not much that the Celtics would be missing out on at all.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/08/09/scalabrine-possibly-heading-to-europe-what-would-this-mean/">Scalabrine Possibly Heading to Europe: What Would This Mean?</a> (433 words)</p>
