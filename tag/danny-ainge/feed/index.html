<p>The Celtics recently lost out on the Kevin Durant sweepstakes when he opted to sign with the Golden State Warriors on July 4th, but now it looks like Danny Ainge is trying to acquire the other superstar player from OKC and bring him in to the current crop of C&#8217;s players, including newly signed big man Al Horford.</p>
<p>Oklahoma City obviously lost a huge part of their team when Durant left town and with only one year remaining on his contract, Thunder management must figure they should ship Westbrook off now and get something for him, instead of letting him enter free agency next summer where he could potentially leave for nothing.</p>
<p>The C&#8217;s are in prime position to deal for Westbrook because of the plethora of valuable trade-chips they have including young players like Avery Bradley or Marcus Smart, any of the six selections from this years draft, and most notably, the remaining Brooklyn Nets picks that project to be high lottery selections once again.</p>
<p>Adding Westbrook to this Celtics squad would make them the runaway favorites as the one team that could challenge the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference, as well as an instantly more exciting team due to Westbrook&#8217;s electric, sometimes over-the-top, style of play.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is since this will be Westbrook&#8217;s contract year, there is no guarantee he will resign next summer when his deal expires. This could affect the value of a potential trade for Westbrook in which Ainge uses this as leverage so he doesn&#8217;t have to give up as much to get him.</p>
<p>No matter what may happen these next few weeks, the Celtics are clearly showing they aren&#8217;t messing around this offseason and are serious about winning a title within the next few years. Although Westbrook might not put them over the top, they&#8217;ll be much closer to glory than most and will be one fun team to watch next season.</p>

It&#8217;s all happening! Everything is awesome! It&#8217;s not a stretch to say that yesterday was the biggest day in the Groesbeck/Ainge/Stevens era in Boston. Danny was finally able to close that elusive big-name free agent, and Wyc was able to make good on his promise of &#8220;fireworks&#8221; that the fan base has been waiting on for what feels like centuries. Sure, $113 million over four years seems like a pretty penny, but with the money being thrown around this offseason and the huge cap increase on the horizon next season, Horford&#8217;s deal is actually somewhat of a bargain.</p>
<p>Horford&#8217;s game will fit seamlessly within the Brad Stevens system. He provides a much needed presence at the rim, and gives the C&#8217;s the go-to fourth quarter scoring option that they were sorely missing in last year&#8217;s playoffs. I cannot WAIT to see Isaiah and Horford running the pick and pop down the throats of the entire Eastern Conference come October.</p>
<p>By no means is Al Horford a perfect player, as evidence by his lackluster performance in the playoffs last season against these Celtics. He struggles defensively at times, particularly on the perimeter defending the pick and roll. The C&#8217;s team approach to defense should help to conceal some of Horford&#8217;s defensive deficiencies over the course of the season.</p>
<p>Hot damn, the Celtics are officially back. They finally landed a big name free-agent for the first time in the history of the franchise, (Go ahead look it up, I&#8217;ll wait) and they got a guy who WANTS to play in Boston. KD or not, this signing was a huge step in the right direction for this franchise. If TB12, Big Papi, and Julian Edleman have anything to do with it, Kevin Durant will be donning Celtic green next season in the city of champions. What a time to be a Celtics fan. What a time to be alive.</p>

Tom Brady, the GOAT, was in attendance at the meeting to help Danny Ainge in the recruitment of Durant. Also David Ortiz would have been there to help but he was busy nuking baseballs into the stands at Fenway.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Kevin Durant needs to come to Boston. The Celts just signed All-Star Al Horford to a four year 113 million dollar deal, Isaiah Thomas is our point guard, Brad Stevens is the head coach, and the team is only improving. If Durant signs with Boston, they immediately become a contender for the NBA Finals. This new big three of Thomas, Horford, and Durant would be absurd. Three legitimate elite players on the same team would do some damage next season so it only makes sense for Kevin to play for the Celtics and he has to know that.</p>
<p>One thing I hope Kevin understands is just how praised he will be in Boston. Players in the NBA know that Boston fans are different. We&#8217;re the most passionate fans out there and we are always there supporting our team through the good and the ugly. Al Horford told his Dad that part of the reason he signed with the Celtics is because of the fans. He knows that when he steps foot on the hardwood in the Garden wearing that green jersey, everyone is going to go nuts for him. If Kevin Durant does the same, he will become loved beyond belief in Boston and I know that for a fact. And hey it&#8217;s Boston&#8230;who doesn&#8217;t love it here?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what was said in Durant&#8217;s meeting with the Celtics but I do know one thing. Ainge most definitely told Durant that if he comes to Boston, he will become a Celtic legend, just like he told Isaiah. So please Kevin, make the right and best decision of your life and play for the best basketball franchise ever.</p>

<p>Al Horford has been recruited by Durant to come to OKC for some time now.  So The Celtics acquiring Horford makes the Celtics pitch that much more intriguing.  Horford is a top 20 player in the NBA, and with Isaiah already in green, The Celtics could put serious pressure on The Cavs if Durant is to choose Boston.  The fact that just hours after The meeting with The Celtics, Durant informed The Clippers he would not be signing with them is very interesting.</p>
<p>I am really starting to think that this could actually happen, and if it does, perhaps Brady&#8217;s number 12 should be retired in the rafters at the TD Garden.</p>

Clippers, The Thunder, and yes The Boston Celtics.</p>
<p>Think about this list, a team that just broke the regular season wins record, a team who recently won back to back championships, the best team of the last 10 plus years, a team that has Cp3 and Blake Griffin, and the team that drafted him.  This is the brass of the NBA (besides Cleveland).  Yes, The Celtics are more than likely number 6 on this list, however at least they are on it.  This list does not include the glamour of The Lakers, the bright lights of New York, it doesn&#8217;t include Houston were James Harden resides, and most surprisingly The Washington Wizards (Durant&#8217;s hometown) did not make the cut.</p>
<p>The Celtic&#8217;s just being on this list speaks volumes, this could single-handedly make Boston more intriguing to free agents.   For years Boston has been laying the groundwork to become a destination for free agents, and finally there is a glimmer of hope.  Hope that free agents can see the history of The Celtics, see the banners in the rafters, and see that this team with Brad Stevens has the potential to be a contender in the east.  The Celtics are also the only team that will meet with Durant that has room for 2 max contracts.</p>
<p>Do I think Durant will be in green next season?  No I don&#8217;t. However if the meeting goes well, and Durant signs a one year deal in OKC and tests free agency again in 2017 then I think there is a real chance it could happen.  Durant and his people hear the plan, Ainge executes it and next season Durant entertains the idea of Boston again.  Remember Celtic fans, Ainge started recruiting Kevin Garnett 3 years prior to trading for him.  Could we see history repeat itself?</p>

<p>Then the first 2 picks went off the board and the moment was finally here.  Celtics fans everywhere were expecting Adam Silver to go to the podium and announce a trade.  Then as he stepped up to the podium he said &#8220;And with the number 3 pick The Boston Celtics select Jaylen Brown From The University Of California&#8221;.  Just like that Celtic fans everywhere were deflated (sorry I know that&#8217;s a touchy word around New England).  All this hope has been shot down, and from the reaction of Celtic fans they were not happy.  It was good to see Boston fans boo, Celtic fans don&#8217;t do that often and it really seemed like Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck looked uncomfortable when he was booed off the stage.  Which by the way I don&#8217;t think has ever happened before.</p>
<p>Personally, I like Jaylen Brown as a player.  He&#8217;s versatile, athletic, and can defend other team&#8217;s best player.  The problem is The Celtics have multiple guys on the roster with these same skills.  Brown has to improve his shooting, last season he only shot .294% from the three point line.  Jaylen Brown could be an impact player for The Celtics, and it could be this season.  We won&#8217;t know if this was the right pick until two to three years from now.  After the Celtics didn&#8217;t make a splash with pick number 3, I felt they were going to draft and stash.  The Celtic&#8217;s didn&#8217;t want to be tied up with guaranteed contracts and not be able to do something in free agency, and the only way to draft guys and not have to pay them was to stash them overseas.</p>
<p>The Celtics and more importantly Wyc Grousbeck have really created this monster.  This monster being us Celtics fans that want to win now and are tired of always waiting for next year&#8217;s draft.  We all know Danny is really trying to bring a superstar into Boston, but until that happens don&#8217;t promise us fireworks and then leave us with an unlit firecracker.</p>

<p>The Celtics lottery woes were never more evident than in the 1997 draft, when the C&#8217;s were heavy favorites to win the lottery and select can&#8217;t-miss prospect Tim Duncan with the first overall pick. As we all so painfully remember, the Spurs ended up with that coveted first pick, and the dark cloud of draft day despair has been hanging over the Celtics ever since.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2016/05/18/celtics-get-3-at-draft-lottery-where-do-we-go-from-here/">Celtics Get #3 at Draft Lottery: Where do we go from here?</a> (707 words)</p>

Trade this pick for an established superstar?  Draft ANOTHER young player who won&#8217;t pan out for the next 3-5 years?  It must be tough to be Danny Ainge this time of year.</p>
<p>Danny Ainge has a reputation around the league of getting the best of trades.  I challenge anyone to give me a trade that Danny has lost.  Every blockbuster trade that has involved The Celtics the last few years have been in their favor, and it&#8217;s not even close.  The Kevin Garnett trade, the Ray Allen trade, the Brooklyn trade, the Rondo trade, even the Jeff Green trade.  All trades that have benefited The Celtics and hurt their trade partner.  If Danny is going to make a big splash this offseason, he&#8217;s going to have to talk someone else into giving up a superstar caliber player.</p>
<p>With Ben Simmons and Brandon Ingram likely being off the board when the Celtics select.  Danny&#8217;s first action should be looking for a trade.  Guys like, Jimmy Butler, Paul George, and Demarcus Cousins have been all the talk around Boston.  All of these guys will take a king&#8217;s ransom to acquire, but for the right deal they could all be in green next season.  What should Danny be willing to give up?  With all these players and picks he has acquired through the years it&#8217;s time to cash in, in other words if Indiana wants this year&#8217;s pick, next year&#8217;s Brooklyn&#8217;s pick and Jae Crowder then you do it.  It&#8217;s time for this &#8220;Fireworks&#8221; statement to be true.</p>
<p>If there is no trade to be made before or on draft night and Ainge is forced to take a player, he has to take someone who can help this team sooner rather than later.  Jamal Murray from Kentucky would be my pick at number 3.  Murray who is 19 years old could be a star in the league someday, standing at 6&#8217;5 he could be a 2 guard and a small wing player.  Murray seems like the guy who wants to take the big shot, who wants the ball in crunch time.  Last season he averaged 20 points, 5 rebounds, and just about 3 assists on the season.  His best basketball moment came on the international stage.  In the 2015 Pan Am games Murray was playing for team Canada.  In a game against the USA, Murray was scoreless through the first 3 quarters, but then exploded in the fourth.  Scoring 22 points while dishing out 6 assists in the fourth quarter he led Canada to a 111-108 win over the USA.  This is the type of player the Celtics need.  Murray can take over a game and would be a great compliment to Isaiah Thomas.  If you&#8217;re not going to trade the pick than Murray is the guy to go after.</p>
<p>The NBA draft is June 23rd.</p>

<p>In his absence, the Celtics lost four in a row to the Rockets, Indiana Pacers, Oklahoma City Thunder, and Toronto Raptors before rebounding with wins over the lowly Philadelphia 76ers and the struggling Orlando Magic.

Initial speculation focused on Al Horford and Jeff Teague but as the deadline approached another blockbuster deal developed. Unfortunately for Celtics fans the front office kept the details confidential.</p>
<p>During a recent appearance on WEEI&#8217;s OM&amp;F, Celtics&#8217; President of Basketball Operations Danny Ainge confirmed that a deal was &#8220;very close&#8221; to transpiring until the other team backed out in the final moments. The target of this deal, Ainge revealed, was the Sixers&#8217; 20 year old center Jahlil Okafor.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Ainge did not divulge and the exact specifics of the deal remain a mystery. It is safe to presume the deal involved the Nets&#8217; highly coveted first round selection in the upcoming draft and possibly David Lee&#8217;s contract, but the details of the agreement remain subject to speculation. In any case this revelation from Ainge is a very interesting development for eager Celtics fans.</p>
<p>Okafor is raw low-post presence with the opportunity at greatness and stardom. Renown among local sports fans for his involvement in a bar fight in Boston after their game against the Celtics at the start of the season, the 20 year old rookie has plenty of time to mature and develop. This will need to happen both on and off the basketball court. On the court he has, statistically, been quite impressive in his rookie campaign despite the deplorable Sixers&#8217; record. In 48 appearances so far this year the Duke product has averaged 17.1 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 1.2 blocks in his 30.2 minutes per game.</p>
<p>The idea of Jahlil Okafor on this young roster is unexpected yet captivating. Imagine adding his presence to the Celtics&#8217; front court? It would add a dimension to the offense that this team lacks. As a go-to scorer and quality rebounder in the paint, the only concerns about Okafor emerge on defensive side of the basketball. He has always been such a physical superior among his peers that his lack of technique and awareness were never at risk of exploitation. Now that he has finally reached the NBA these aspects of his game need polish, but if he puts in the hard work both are skills that can develop and improve.</p>
<p>As Celtics fans let&#8217;s hope the Sixers&#8217; don&#8217;t fully default on their interest in a deal involving Okafor. There is a lot left to be determined between now and the NBA draft, and even more rime before the start of the next season; this trade could still materialize. In the mean time we should cross our fingers and trust in Ainge&#8217;s ability to entice the Sixers because Okafor is a generational talent who could address an important void in the Celtics roster.</p>
