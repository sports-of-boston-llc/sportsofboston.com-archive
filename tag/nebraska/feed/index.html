<p>Right now the safest bet in college football is Boise State. If you are looking for a sure thing, bet Boise State. They have the best shot at finishing undefeated among the top five teams. The combined record of their final five opponents is 17-20. Here is another great reason why Boise could play for the national championship: the other teams are going to beat up on each other. Alabama and LSU play this week, so someone is going to lose. Oklahoma State still has to play Oklahoma, who is ranked sixth, and Stanford still has to play Oregon. I look at Boise State as gold. No matter what they are a safe bet to invest in.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation: Buy</strong></p>
<h2>Nebraska</h2>
<p>Nebraska controls their own fate. If they win out they will play in the Big Ten championship. Here is the problem: they play at Penn State and at Michigan in consecutive weeks. Penn State is 8-1 and 5-0 in Big Ten play and Michigan is tied for first in the Legends division with Nebraska. If the schedule wasn&#8217;t enough to scare you off them, Taylor Martinez should be. He is completing just 55% of his passes and last week through for just 80 yards. Martinez may be able to skate by with numbers like that against Penn State, but against Michigan he will need to be much more effective. So sell Nebraska, shaky quarterback play and a touch schedule going forward is too much for the Cornhuskers.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation: Sell</strong></p>
