<h2>Jerod Mayo: The Anchor</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.patriots.com/team/roster/Jerod-Mayo/bec56907-0614-4b0e-8409-7f0f2e1fa05b">Jerod Mayo</a> is entering his fifth year in the NFL. Last season was the first season in his young career where he did not register at least 100 tackles; he settled for 95. Mayo missed some time last season due to a knee injury, and his importance to the defense was apparent when he was on or off the field. Mayo plays a vital role in the play-calling for the defense, as well as putting players into the correct positioning.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2012/07/30/2012-patriots-linebackers-preview-experienced-youth/">2012 Patriots Linebackers Preview: Experienced Youth</a> (705 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Patriots are expected to release veteran outside linebacker Roosevelt Colvin in a salary cap decision. Colvin, 31, was expected to count $7.5 million against the cap in 2008, which was to be the last year of his contract. Colvin missed much of the year due to injury and the move now frees up space if the Patriots wish to sign players or keep the seventh overall pick in the upcoming draft.</p>
<p><strong>My Take:</strong> It&#8217;s sad to see Rosie go, but it&#8217;s a little refreshing to see the Patriots are finally looking to revamp their linebacker corps. Adalius Thomas and Mike Vrabel are natural OLBs, yet both have spent time in the middle in the Patriots 3-4 defensive system. This could mean the Pats are looking to acquire and ILB or perhaps they still will move either Thomas or Vrabel inside and draft an OLB. It sounds as though the move was not very surprising as a $7.5 million cap hit for a guy who missed most of two of the seasons in his contract due to injury is quite high.</p>
<p>I had very high hopes for Colvin when he arrived from Chicago, but his serious hip injury really stopped his development. He turned in some pretty decent seasons but overall I&#8217;d have to call him a disappointment. That all said, I would like to see the Patriots attempt to re-sign him to less money and keep him on as a team leader.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rosevelt Colvin has been placed on injured reserve and will miss the rest of the season. Colvin left Sunday&#8217;s game against the Eagles with an apparent arm or foot injury (depending on who you talk to).</p>
<p>In his absence, Adalius Thomas is the likely candidate to take his place on the edge. This will mean an expanded role for ILBs Junior Seau and Tedy Bruschi. The Patriots also signed LB Chad Brown, who might also see action at inside LB.</p>
<p>In other news, WR Troy Brown has been activated off the physically unable to perform list.  Brown had seemingly been doomed for injured reserve or the free agent market. With Colvin on injured reserve and defensive lineman Kareem Brown being waived, the open roster spots have been filled by Troy and Chad Brown.<br />
The Patriots now have seven WR on the roster: Moss, Stallworth, Welker, Kelley Washington, Jabar Gaffney, Chad Jackon and Brown.</p>
<p>More news on Colvin&#8217;s injury as it comes out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In the third edition of a week long preview of the Colts vs. Pats (deemed El ClÃ¡sico after a world famous European football rivalry between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid), Iâll take a look at the linebackers for each team.</em></p>
<p><strong>Patriots</strong><br />
<em>Mike Vrabel, Tedy Bruschi, Adalius Thomas, Junior Seau, Roosevelt Colvin</em>: The Patriots possess the most dangerous set of linebackers in the NFL. They have speed, strength and a half century worth of years in experience. With the return of Junior Seau this season, the Patriots also gained depth at middle linebacker. Bruschi has been very consistent this season, leading the team with 48 tackles. Adalius Thomas has come as advertised, mainly playing in the middle but has been very versatile. He has 38 tackles and half sack this year and had perhaps the defensive play of the year when he intercepted a Phillip Rivers pass and returned it to the house in Week 2, outrunning a few receivers in the process. His raw size and speed are incredible and he&#8217;ll have the job of bumping Dallas Clark off the line and stuffing the run of Joseph Addai. The real key to Sunday&#8217;s game from a linebacker point of view is off the edge. Mike Vrabel is the most underrated player in the NFL, as he showed his might last week with a TD catch and two forced fumbles. He leads the team with a 7.5 sacks and looks very comfortable back in his natural position. Roosevelt Colvin also must be able to put pressure on Peyton Manning or he will torch the vulnerable Patriots secondary.</p>
<p><strong>Colts</strong><br />
<em>Rocky Boiman, Tyjuan Hagler, Greg Brackett, Freddie Keiaho</em>: The Colts linebackers have come as advertised this year.  None of them will blow you away with athleticism, and outside of Brackett none have any notoriety. Throughout the season the linebackers have been able to stuff the run with some success and have more of a smash mouth attitude after their Super Bowl victory last season. As I pointed out in my preview of the secondaries, both cornberbacks on the Colts have more tackles than any linebacker. Brackett, Boiman and Keiaho&#8217;s job Sunday will be to stuff the run of Maroney, sniff out screens to Faulk and at times try to cover Ben Watson &#8211; if he plays. Watson is one of the fastest TEs in the NFL and it remains to be seen if he can be covered by any of the Colts linebackers. A lot of their success Sunday will depend on how the front four are able to push the Patriots offensive line to open up holes in order to put pressure on Tom Brady. The Colts linebackers have a tough job to complete on Sunday against an outstanding offensive line and a speedy TE.</p>
<p><strong>The Verdict:</strong> In probably the most lopsided comparison, the Patriots linebackers are superior at each position. Vrabel and Colvin come off the edge with reckless abandon and the trio of Bruschi, Seau and Thomas in the middle will make life hard for Addai. The Pats have a better linebacker corps than any other team in the NFL and they need to play like it this Sunday to stop the Colts offensive juggernaught. <strong>Edge: Patriots</strong></p>
<p>Check back tomorrow as I&#8217;ll preview the offensive and defense lines.</p>
