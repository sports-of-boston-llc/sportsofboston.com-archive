				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LeBron James and two other teammates have tested positive for Influenza A, and are being tested for the H1N1 strain of the virus, popurlarly known as the swine flu. James had an intense fever for two days and slept for 22 hours in a row.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t remember ever being that sick,&#8221; James said.</p>
<p>LeBron thinks he got the flu from the shot he and his teammates recently got to fight the virus. If he got that sick from the shot, that&#8217;s not a good sign for the rest of us. Remember, he&#8217;s 6&#8217;8&#8243; and 250 lbs.</p>
<p>James should be ready by the Oct. 27 season opener against the Celtics. Personally, I think he should stay away from the court in order to fully recover.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite sweeping the Red Sox, many players on the Texas Rangers were battling the flu. Vincente Padilla had to miss a start against the Sox due to the flu as well. In recent years, when you hear &#8220;flu,&#8221; you think the person will be fine and back again sometime soon. Lately, &#8220;flu&#8221; has a more alarming connotation, and that fear turned into fact when Padilla was diagnosed with the swine flu, or H1N1 A influenza on Friday.</p>
<p>Padilla is thought to be the first U.S. professional sports athlete to test positive for the H1N1 flu, which is currently in its early stages of a world pandemic. Other players are now being tested, and according to assistant GM Thad Levine, more Rangers players could be diagnosed.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Without speculating, I think it is reasonable to expect that we may find some of our other guys have it,&#8221; <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4354938">Levine said</a>. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been medicating our players. We would use the same medication and the same kind program to rehabilitate them and they&#8217;ve all shown improvement. Those are the positive signs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Other players down with the flu are Eddie Guardado, Omar Vizquel, David Murphy, and Jarrod Saltalamacchia.</p>
<p>Padilla is doing better now, and will probably make his next scheduled start on Tuesday. As a precaution, Padilla was separated from the team so he could avoid spreading the flu.</p>
