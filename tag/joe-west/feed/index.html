<p>Let’s look at the horror show that occurred Wednesday in Orlando. Those two technical fouls on Perk were absolutely absurd. I’ve seen tougher fouls given in a girls&#8217; JV game. Seriously. Now the Celtics are facing the very real possibility of having to play Game 6 without their starting center. (Fortunately, after this article was published, <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/05/27/nba-rescinds-perks-technical-celtics-still-cling-to-3-2-series-lead/">the NBA rescinded a technical on Perk, and he will be available for Game 6</a>) How about earlier in the series when <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/05/27/nba-rescinds-perks-technical-celtics-still-cling-to-3-2-series-lead/">the ref was suspended for throwing a ball at a fan</a>? The following day you couldn’t get through SportsCenter without a laughable analysis from any number of anchors. Should that really be the story or at the very least ‘a’ story?(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/05/27/expect-some-fireworks-at-fenway-this-weekend/">Expect Some Fireworks at Fenway This Weekend</a> (625 words)</p>

Player responses to these comments were almost unilaterally negative, citing that if someone has something better to do, let he or she go and do that. The consensus is that no one is forcing people to stay through the entire game, so what right do the umpires have to criticize the pace?</p>
<h2>The Downside of Slow Games</h2>
<p>The fact is, Red Sox-Yankees games are too slow. There are too many visits to the mound. Too many step-outs during at-bats. Too many pitching changes. Every Boston-New York game is played as if it&#8217;s the end of the world. Both teams are stocked with good, patient hitters, so walks and full-count at-bats are inevitable. But more <strong>SHOULD</strong> be done by both teams and the umpires to speed up the game when it&#8217;s possible. There are a number of reasons why, including but not limited to:(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/04/09/joe-west-is-right-about-sox-yankees-these-games-are-slow/">Joe West is Right About Sox, Yankees: These Games are Slow!</a> (601 words)</p>
