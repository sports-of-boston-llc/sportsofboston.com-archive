The Capitals won 4-3 in OT.

<p>As Campbell was getting rid of the puck by his own net, Ovechkin shoved him into the boards. Campbell collapsed, and Ovechkin tripped over him. Ovechkin was given a boarding major and game misconduct. Campbell suffered a broken clavicle and broken ribs, though he seemed well enough all things considered when he sat up, and was further evaluated by the team&#8217;s medical staff Monday.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="justify">While the Bruins are quiet, the trade market opened a bit with some signings that will raise the ante regarding certain players.</p>
<p align="justify"> &#8211; Dan Boyle was re-signed by Tampa Bay to a 6-year, $40 million contract which means that the price for D Brian Campbell (Buffalo Sabres), who failed to re-sign with his team, will increase a lot.</p>
<p align="justify">&#8211; No word on Marrian Hossa and Brad Richards. Ottawa and Montreal have been labeled as the emerging front runners but &#8220;it&#8217;s every men for itself&#8221; at the trade deadline and don&#8217;t be surprised to see Hossa traded elsewhere.</p>
<p align="justify">&#8211; There&#8217;s also a rumor this morning that says that former Bruin Marty Lapointe could be traded.  Lapointe will add gritz, experience and leadership for the team that will able to land him&#8230;</p>
