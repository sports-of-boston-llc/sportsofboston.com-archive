Is it not exciting to be a die hard fan of one of the most potent teams, year in and year out? In such a weak division, the playoffs are usually a lock, and this year will be no different.</p>
<p>The most exciting offseason move for the Patriots thus far was the acquisition of Martellus Bennett, who himself stated that he was excited to play the role of Robin, as Gronk is already Batman.</p>
<p>Combined with Bennett, the Patriots also signed Chris Long and Nate Washington. Three veteran players who are excited to join a winning franchise could add up to a hefty sum of money, but not if you&#8217;re Bill Belichick-all three players combine for a salary cap hit of less than ten million dollars.</p>

The cause of the hospitalization has not been made public.</p>
<p>Jones arrived at the Foxborough police department on Sunday morning and was evaluated by five officers and subsequently taken to the hospital. An officer was also sent to Jones&#8217; home in order to &#8220;secure the residence.&#8221;</p>
<p>While acknowledging that Jones had been to the hospital, the Patriots said in a statement that Jones had shown up for work on Monday and not missed any meetings or practice.  The Foxborough Police Department initially did not acknowledge that it dealt with Jones but later did and added that it was due to a &#8220;medical call.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this point, details are not easy to come across and it does not appear that this incident will affect Jones&#8217; status for the team&#8217;s playoff game on Saturday. Things could change between now and then and this story bears monitoring over the next several days.</p>

The Chiefs were dominant on defense and forced a shaky Houston offense into a borderline embarrassing performance. Kansas City was able to get after Houston quarterback Brian Hoyer forcing a fumble and four interceptions. Despite the pressure put on by the Chiefs defensive line Hoyer was also his own worst enemy making terrible decisions, particularly in the red zone. Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith and the KC offense was efficient against a tough Houston defensive that held them to just six points in the first half however they led 13-0 at the break thanks to a 106-yard kickoff returned for a touchdown by Knile Davis to start the game. In the second half the Chiefs were able to open up the lead as Hoyer and the Texans continued to shoot themselves in the foot. Kansas City, playing on the road, was not phased by the 71,000 screaming  fans or defensive stud J.J. Watt who they avoided with quick hitting pass plays, screens, sweeps and extra manpower. Alex Smith finished the day 17 of 22 for 190 yards with a touchdown and a rare interception, coach Andy Reid&#8217;s experience and game plan worked perfectly. Kansas City is now riding an 11-game win streak coming into Foxborough for next week&#8217;s divisional round playoff match up and should be as confident as ever.</p>
<p>One key problem for the Chiefs is the status of star receiver Jeremy Macklin who has been a go to guy for Alex Smith all season. Macklin suffered and injury to his ACL late in the second half of the win in Houston and did not return. He is due to have an MRI today to assess the extent of the damage, KC fans will be crossing their fingers in hopes that Macklin does not have a tear in that right knee. Maclin caught 87 passes for 1,088 yards and eight touchdowns during the regular season. Also banged up coming into the game against the Patriots will be Tamba Hali with a thumb and knee injury who had limited action against the Texans but is a key figure in the pass rush for KC that will be essential to getting pressure on Tom Brady, the formula for disrupting the flow of the Patriots offense. Linebacker Justin Houston also seemed to tweak his knee which has been a lingering injury for him this season causing him to miss five games.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2016/01/10/pats-draw-streaking-chiefs-for-divisional-round-playoff/">Pats Draw Streaking Chiefs For Divisional Round Playoff</a> (519 words)</p>

Adding Jackson to the 53-man roster put the Patriots at a total of 75 different players making up the 53-man roster over the course of this season. The injuries have been noticeable and if this were any other team they would have been crippled. Instead Bill Belichick and Tom Brady have steered the ship to another first round playoff bye and with another win can lock up home field advantage throughout the playoffs. Injuries are part of the game but it&#8217;s obvious that no one handles them better than the New England Patriots.</p>
<p>&#8211; Joey Iosefa is the exact reason Patriots fans only wonder one thing every year which is &#8220;are they going to have the first or second seed?&#8221; LeGarrette Blount was finally getting the late season production that he has been so good at. Just as he&#8217;s getting the carries he goes down for the year with a hip injury. The expectation was James White and Brandon Bolden would see an increased role, which they both did. In classic Belichick fashion he promoted Iosefa from he practice squad on Saturday night. Iosefa then carried the ball 14 times for 51 hard earned yards, while also blocking as a full back. Sure it wasn&#8217;t a Jonas Gray 200-yard game but Belichick once again found production where you&#8217;d least expect it. The addition of Steven Jackson adds depth and experience, not to mention he has fresh legs. For how the Patriots use the running game they definitely have the pieces in place for a postseason push.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/12/21/notes-and-observations-week-15-patriots-clinch-1st-round-bye-handling-the-titans-33-16/">Notes and Observations Week 15: Patriots Clinch 1st Round Bye Handling the Titans 33-16</a> (1,430 words)</p>

Offensively the team is still banged up but the return of Rob Gronkowski made an immediate impact. Julian Edelman returned to the practice field much earlier than anyone expected, granted it was light work but still a positive sight nonetheless. Both of those only added to the fact that the Bengals lost the game and Andy Dalton for potentially the rest of the season and the Broncos blew a 12-0 lead at home against the Raiders. The Patriots took the opening and now control their own destiny.</p>
<p>&#8211; Sunday night was the most balanced offensive game plan that they&#8217;ve used all year. Tom Brady finished with 30 pass attempts while the team as a whole ran the ball 31 times. They finally decided to stick with the run and it paid dividends. LeGarrette Blount looked to be having his most productive game of the season rushing 10 times for 53 yards. Unfortunately his day and season were ended early. Brandon Bolden showed a good burst for his first extended look of the season finishing with 51 yards on 16 carries. James White started to make more of an impact in the passing game gaining 27 yards on a screen pass. It&#8217;s a shame that one of the best rushing games for the year is marred by the loss of Blount.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/12/16/notes-and-observations-week-14-patriots-take-control-of-the-afc-defeat-texans-27-6/">Notes and Observations Week 14: Patriots Take Control of The AFC, Defeat Texans 27-6</a> (1,046 words)</p>

(AP Photo/Joe Mahoney)" ></a><p>Now that we&#8217;ve all had a full 24 hours to digest the frustrating monstrosity that was Sunday Night Football, we can rationally examine the remains. While it was fun to imagine this team really sticking it to the whole league and going 16-0 everyone knew just how hard that task would be. Every team in the league has to deal with injuries and atrocious officiating every single week, but Sunday night was the culmination of a season of that frustration for the previously undefeated Patriots. After losing key offensive weapons three consecutive weeks in Dion Lewis, Julian Edelman, and Danny Amendola, they narrowly escaped another major knee injury to Rob Gronkowski. The NFL referees have been astonishingly awful all season for every team but they really showed up to play for prime time. Unfortunately they were playing for the Broncos.</p>
<p>&#8211; It&#8217;s easy to write me off as biased and a homer for claiming the refs weren&#8217;t doing the Patriots any favors. However all it takes is a small semblance of a brain to realize the penalties called late in the game were a huge reason Sunday went the way it did. With just under 12 minutes to go in the third quarter and the Patriots up 21-14 Brady hit KeShawn Martin with a 51-yard bomb that was called back for holding on Tre Jackson. With just under five minutes to go in the game Brady hit Gronk on 3rd-and-5 for a 10-yard completion which was of course called back on Gronk&#8217;s fifth offensive pass interference call of the season. The holding on Jackson was borderline and the defender initiated the contact with Gronk, who never even extended his arm. (...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/12/01/notes-and-observations-week-12-patriots-lose-1st-game-in-frustrating-fashion-broncos-win-in-ot-30-24/">Notes and Observations Week 12: Patriots Lose 1st Game in Frustrating Fashion; Broncos Win in OT 30-24</a> (1,139 words)</p>

With the offense devastated by injuries, the defense played some of its best football of the season. The offense is clearly dealing with communication and trust issues with all the new pieces being plugged in along the way. For the first time in weeks the offensive line was healthy but ironically it was the worst they&#8217;ve looked all year. Tom Brady&#8217;s most reliable receiver with zero dropped passes, Danny Amendola, left with an apparent knee injury. After his exit they had three healthy receivers. One was Matthew Slater and another was Chris Harper who has never caught an NFL pass. With all that they still made the plays to win a divisional game in prime time.</p>
<p>&#8211; Aside from a few big plays the defense showed again how good they can be. The front seven was holding contain on Tyrod Taylor for the majority of the game. Pressure caused by the pass rush directly led to multiple poorly thrown passes. LeSean McCoy did break the 27-yard touchdown run but was held to just 55 rushing yards other than that. By his standards that&#8217;s a relatively calm day. Rob Ninkovich continued his solid campaign by adding another 1.5 sacks and pressuring Taylor throughout. Rotating defensive linemen throughout the game has paid off for the Patriots as each group knows exactly what their job is, and they&#8217;re doing it well.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/11/25/notes-and-observations-week-11-defense-leads-battered-patriots-to-victory-over-bills-20-13/">Notes and Observations Week 11: Defense Leads Battered Patriots to Victory Over Bills 20-13</a> (978 words)</p>

The Giants have been the one team to have the Patriots figured out. For most of the game on Sunday it appeared like it was going to be more of the same. We were going to be subjected from a perfect performance from Eli Manning, while Tom Brady looked as mortal as he has all season. Luckily for the Patriots and their fans they were the recipient of the lucky break at the right time.</p>
<p>&#8211; No doubt about the fact that Danny Amendola was the savior of that game. His punt return sparked some much needed life into a team that was dragging. I, like everyone else I imagine, have zero idea what Duron Harmon was trying to accomplish. Amendola walks into the end zone if Harmon stays far, far away from him. On the last drive he was right where he had to be to haul in a laser of a pass to keep the drive going on 4th and 10. His awareness produced the necessary yardage on his catch setting up Stephen Gostkowski for the game winner.

This week was another prime example of just how good we have it here. The Patriots handled the Redskins all game and the win was never in doubt. Tom Brady finished just one yard shy of 300 for the day and threw for two more touchdowns. The defense played as good as they have been the past few weeks. Even with all that it was a bad game by Patriots&#8217; standards.</p>
<p>&#8211; Tom Brady put up another solid performance with 299 yards, going 26-39 with two touchdowns. He had a very uncharacteristic interception that made me do a double take to make sure it was Brady throwing the ball. It was a rare instance where he didn&#8217;t read the defense correctly and just never saw linebacker Keenan Robinson playing zone. Credit to Robinson for reading the play and making the interception, but that was a bad pass by Brady. Again, that&#8217;s how great it is to be a Patriots fan. These awful plays are so few and far between that it&#8217;s actually shocking when it happens.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/11/11/notes-and-observations-week-9-patriots-beat-redskins-27-10-to-go-8-0-for-2nd-time-in-team-history/">Notes and Observations, Week 9: Patriots Beat Redskins 27-10 to go 8-0 for 2nd Time in Team History</a> (929 words)</p>

He celebrates this one with Julian Edelman. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer)" ></a><p>One of the best things about being a Patriots fan is having this luxury of knowing you&#8217;re going to the playoffs every year. Even more than that, you&#8217;re probably going to watch your team in the AFC Championship just like the past four years. In only week eight, the Patriots have basically wrapped up the AFC East. After emasculating the Dolphins on Thursday night they now have wins against each of their AFC East opponents. What&#8217;s more impressive is that score could have been a lot worse. The offense left a lot of first half points on the field as the defense was shutting the Dolphins down. That&#8217;s really nitpicking though as 36 points is nothing to bat an eye at.</p>
<p>&#8211; I genuinely hope everyone watching is really appreciating what Tom Brady is doing this season. What he&#8217;s doing at 38 years old is nothing short of amazing. On Thursday he went 26-38 for 356 yards, with four touchdowns and no interceptions. That brings his totals on the year to 2,410 yards with 20 touchdowns and only one interception that came off a bobbled pass from Julian Edelman. He&#8217;s on pace to throw over 5,500 yards, about 47 touchdowns, and maybe have three interceptions. He&#8217;s more focused than he&#8217;s ever been and it was never more apparent than on one play in the fourth quarter. With the game already in hand with a score of 29-7, Brady took a sack after missing a read. He then slammed the ball and his fist in frustration. Even though the game was already over Brady wasn&#8217;t satisfied. He wants to leave no points on the field. Tom Brady wants to win this season more than he wants anything in the world and I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anyone out there who can slow him down. (...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/11/02/notes-and-observations-week-8-patriots-virtually-clinch-afc-east-in-36-7-win-over-dolphins/">Notes and Observations, Week 8: Patriots Virtually Clinch AFC East in 36-7 Win Over Dolphins</a> (1,046 words)</p>
