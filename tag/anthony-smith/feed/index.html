<p>It started with Rex Ryan sending a <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/09/16/rex-ryan-voicemail-to-jets-fans/">recorded message</a> to New York Jets season ticket holders.  He reassured fans that on Sunday, &#8220;we&#8217;re going to see who has a better team.&#8221;  Next was Jets safety Kerry Rhodes, who might have opened a new can of worms:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Not just go out there and try to win, try to embarrass them.  Try to make them feel bad when they leave here&#8230;. We don&#8217;t want to just beat them.  We&#8217;re not backing down from you and we expect to win this game.  It&#8217;s not going to be luck, it&#8217;s not going to be a mistake.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Thirteen down, just three to go for a perfect regular season. After back-to-back close calls, the Patriots pounded the Steelers Sunday as Tom Brady and Randy Moss moved close to single season records. Here&#8217;s what we learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>DON&#8217;T MAKE GUARANTEES AGAINST UNDEFEATED TEAMS: Sure, safety Anthony Smith made headlines with his guarantee this week, but he was downright abused Sunday. Moss&#8217; second TD catch &#8211; a 63 yard bomb off a <em>perfect</em> play action fake from Brady &#8211; went right at Smith and Moss breezed by him. During the flea-flicker TD pass in the third, Smith again was abused as he let Jabar Gaffney behind him leading to the score. During his post-game press conference, Bill Belichick seemed to go out of character in calling out Smith. After being asked about the guarantee Belichick said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll just let Rodney&#8217;s comments stand (Harrison had remarked &#8220;Never heard of him&#8221;). We&#8217;ve played against much better safeties than him.&#8221; Whoa nelly!</li>
<li>RED ZONE DEFENSE CAN STEP UP: By keeping the Ravens from finding the end zone on their first drive and later on stopping the Steelers from scoring at all from first and goal from the five, the Pats red zone defense finally made the stops. After spending much of the season near the bottom the league in that category, the Patriots came up with the big plays which gave the offense a chance to go out and do their thing.</li>
<li>BRADY-MOSS IS THE GREATEST TANDEM SINCE MONTANA-RICE: Yes, that includes Manning-Harrison, Aikman-Irvin and Young-Rice. Brady threw for 399 yards and four TDs Sunday and now with 45 TD passes on the season, he sits only four behind Manning for the single season record with three games to go. Moss has 19 TD catches (should have been 20 if not for his drop near the end of the game) in 2007 and trails only Jerry Rice&#8217;s 22 for the single season record (side note: Rice caught his 22 TD passes in just 12 weeks during a strike shortened season!). If Brady and Moss had been together since the beginning, who knows what kinds of records they could have broken. While they never will have the sheer stats of a Manning-Harrison partnership, to watch them operate on the field is simply remarkable.</li>
<li>BARRING INJURY, THE PATRIOTS WILL INDEED GO 16-0: Take a back seat &#8217;72 Dolphins, you will soon have company in the undefeated club. With the big win Sunday, the Pats only need to beat the 3-10 Jets, 0-13 Dolphins and 9-4 Giants to complete their undefeated regular season. The Giants pose the biggest threat, but have yet to score a true signature (or impressive) win over a quality opponent this year.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong><br />
It was a special afternoon/evening at Gillette. There were many &#8220;terrible towel&#8221; waving Steelers fans at &#8220;The Razor&#8221; and they were treated to an old school Patriot beat down. The Pats only ran the ball 10 times and though the defense gave up two big plays on one drive (a long Willie Parker run and the scrambling 32 yard TD pass to Najeh Davenport) the defense held the Steelers in check and won the battle in the trenches. Vince Wilfork also had an outstanding game in the middle. It was a very impressive win at a time when not many people expected it. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see just how high the point spread is for next week&#8217;s game against the Jets.</p>

<p><strong>The Game:</strong> Pittsburgh Steelers at New England Patriots<br />
<strong>The Place:</strong> Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Mass<br />
<strong>The Time:</strong> 4:15pm<br />
<strong>The Channel:</strong> CBS<br />
<em>The Skinny:</em> On paper this is the toughest game left for the unbeaten Patriots. The Steelers are quietly having a very good season overall and possess one of the best defenses in the NFL. Pittsburgh is unbeaten this year but just 2-3 on the road, including losses to Denver and the woeful Jets. Ben Roethlisberger has rebounded from last year&#8217;s struggle and has 25 touchdown passes on the season. The Steelers are a dangerous teams because they possess many of the same qualities as the Ravens team who nearly beat the Pats last week: a power running game, good coaching and a smash mouth attitude. The Patriots are coming off two wins which may have felt like losses, as they were beaten thoroughly in the trenches against the Ravens and seem tired after three straight night games and a short week of practice. If the Pats can prevail, an undefeated regular season would be in reach with pretty smooth sailing until week 17.</p>
<p><strong>3 Keys to the Game:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>WIN THE BATTLE IN THE TRENCHES: For the first time in recent memory, the Patriots defense was pushed around all night against Baltimore. Ty Warren, Vince Wilfork and Richard Seymour were dominated and allowed Willis McGahee to run wild into the secondary; the Pats offensive line wasn&#8217;t much better. With the infamous zone blitzing scheme of Steelers defensive coordinator Dick LaBeau, the entire offensive line will need to play smart to keep Brady off his back.</li>
<li>KEEP WELKER INVOLVED: Last Monday, Wes Welker had a couple catches in the first quarter and seemingly was never heard from again. Welker is just as important to this offense as Randy Moss is as Wes can torch nearly any linebacker in the slot and usually demands safety cover, allowing Moss more room to roam. With the ability to run on the Pittsburgh defense in doubt, Welker must get involved and stay involved if the Patriots are to move the ball at will.</li>
<li>SCORE EARLY TO SET THE TONE: Much of the reason the Ravens were nearly able to knock off the Patriots is that they were able to stick to their power running game plan. If the Patriots score the opening touchdown and get up early, teams will have to evolve into more of a passing/catch up scheme. If the Pats get up early on the Steelers and make Willie Parker less of a factor, New England will be able to sit back in coverage and force Big Ben mistakes.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Prediction</strong><br />
After the Colts game, Pittsburgh was always seen as the opponent with the best chance to unseat the Patriots. After two close games for the Pats, the Steelers are the sexy pick by pundits this week. I think if the Pats can get up early and force the Steelers away from the power running game, Asante Samuel and Rodney Harrison will be able to make a few big plays. In front of a raucous home crowd (including myself) and staring home-field advantage in the face, the Patriots will win the battle in the trenches and pull out a gutsy victory. Moss is due for a big game and this may be the week.</p>
<p><strong>Patriots 34, Steelers 27</strong></p>
