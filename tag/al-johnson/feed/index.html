(Photo by zimbio.com)" ></a><p>According to <a href="http://www.patriots.com/news/index.cfm?ac=latestnewsdetail&amp;pid=38215&amp;pcid=47">Patriots.com</a>, the Patriots have acquired Oakland Raiders DE/OLB Derrick Burgess. <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/07/25/derrick-burgess-to-the-patriots-still-alive/">Last month SoB explored the possibility of Burgess joining the Patriots</a> around training camp and low behold the disgruntled pass rusher joins a team that is in much need of his services.</p>
<p>Citing the article from last month, Burgess to the Patriots only makes sense.</p>
<blockquote><p>For the Patriots, adding Burgess makes too much sense. Last time I checked there is a huge vacancy at the outside linebacker spot. If the season were to start tomorrow, it would appear that second-year man Shawn Crable would be starting opposite Adalius Thomas. That’s a lot to ask from a player that missed basically his entire rookie season. We know that the Patriots haven’t been shy is kicking the tires with some players. <a href="../../2009/05/14/jason-taylor-signs-with-dolphins/">Jason Taylor was a player the Patriots seemed to welcome</a>, Willie McGinest <a href="//www.sportsofboston.com/2009/07/05/willie-mcginest-to-return-to-the-patriots/">continues to lobby to come back to New England</a>, and now the re-born talks about Burgess. Either way, the Patriots will need to upgrade the position before September rolls around. With three second round picks in the 2010 NFL Draft, the Patriots would be wise to use one of them to acquire a 3-4 pass rushing player.</p></blockquote>
<p>More to come on the impact Burgess should have with the Patriots.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2009/08/burgess_trade_t.html">According to Mike Reiss</a> the Patriots have traded their 2010 third and fourth round draft selections for the duties of Burgess.</p>
<blockquote><p>The trade has a condition that if the Patriots pick up a 2010 fifth-round draft choice (their pick was traded to Tampa Bay for Alex Smith), that pick will go to Oakland instead of the 2010 fourth-round draft choice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also to make room for Burgess the Patriots have released OG Al Johnson. Johnson was signed earlier this off-season.</p>
