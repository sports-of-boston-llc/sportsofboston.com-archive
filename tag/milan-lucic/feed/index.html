<p>Krejci ended the season with 31 points in the 47 games he played, his lowest point total since the 2007-2008 season. If it wasn’t for the MCL tear, Krejci was on pace to score around 60 points.</p>
<p>It would be ideal if Kreci could stay off the IR in 2015-2016 as he is one of the top scorers on the team, and is going to have some new linemates to work with since Milan Lucic was traded to the Los Angeles Kings in a cap-dumping move by the Bruins.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/07/30/david-krejci-the-most-interesting-man-on-the-bruins/">David Krejci: The Most Interesting Man on the Bruins</a> (257 words)</p>

The Bruins also received center prospect Sean Kuraly as part of the deal. Jones had been acquired last week from Los Angeles as part of the return package for Milan Lucic.</p>
<p>Essentially, the Bruins dealt Lucic and have gotten a return of two first round picks and two prospects, which is a pretty impressive haul if the draft picks end up being used correctly. Although this move may not make the team better in 2015-16, it sets up well for the future. Jones, who had been a back up goalie for the Kings, was unlikely to stick around and this was likely the best offer Boston received for him.</p>
<p>The Sharks picked ninth in this years draft and aren&#8217;t likely to get better so this pick could end up being a high one for Boston. The Bruins also extended qualifying offers for Ryan Spooner and Brett Connolly on Tuesday, which are likely to be accepted. Don Sweeney has already made four trades in the last week and it is likely he is not done yet.</p>

The Bruins then made three selections in a row in the first round,a  move that was unprecedented across the NHL. Hamilton was the best young defenseman the Bruins had and Lucic was a major piece on two Stanley Cup Finalist teams who embodied much of hard-nosed, physical style the Bruins have been known for. The shakeup comes at time when the team is bumped up against the cap and still reeling from missing the playoffs.</p>
<p>The day began with Hamilton being shipped off to the Calagry Flames. The Bruins received the 15th, 45th, and 52nd picks in the 2015 draft in return. Not long after, the Bruins sent Lucic to the L.A. Kings in exchange for the 13th pick in the 2015 draft, goalie Martin Jones, and defenseman prospect Colin Miller. The Bruins absorbed $2.75 million of Lucic&#8217;s 2015-16 cap hit to make the deal work.</p>
<p>Hamilton was an unrestricted free agent and his unwillingness to accept Boston&#8217;s contract offer ended up being the major factor behind the Bruins decision to move him. It is definitely a downgrade to their defense corps overall and will force the Bruins to rely heavily on young, unproven players next season. Zach Trotman and Joe Morrow have seen limited action with Boston and may end up playing a majority of the season with big club. Miller could also factor in as well.</p>
<p>Lucic was in the final year of a contract that would have cost the Bruins a $6 million cap hit. The power forward suffered through one of his worst NHL seasons in 2015, leaving some to question if had begun breaking down. There is no question that the Bruins will miss his presence both on the ice and in the locker room and he could be a major help to a Kings team trying to return to Stanley Cup form.</p>
<p>These moves left the Bruins with picks 13 (Kings), 14 (their own), and 15 (Flames) in the draft and the team used all three. They became the first team since 1968 to make three straight first round picks. With the 13th pick, the Bruins selected Jakub Zboril, a defenseman who plays a tough style at 6&#8217;1&#8243;, 185 pounds. The Bruins then took left wing Jake DeBrusk with the 14th pick and  wing Zachary Senyshyn with the 15th pick. Zboril is the most NHL ready of the three and Senyshyn has the farthest to go in terms of development. It was reported that the Bruins tried hard tp move in to the top five to take impact defenseman Noah Hanifin, but they were unable to close the deal.</p>
<p>The Bruins still have the rest of the Summer to alter and upgrade their roster but barring anything else drastic, this will be a much younger looking Black and Gold Squad when the puck drops in October.</p>

This makes him the eighth GM in Bruins history.

<p>So Sweeney has to deal with all of this and deal with all of it soon so he can end the Chiarelli era in Boston and begin an era of his own. There are a few things he has to deal with before anything else.</p>
<h2>Keeping Claude?</h2>
<p>It is best for the Bruins organization if Sweeney officially makes up his mind on whether he is going to keep Claude Julien as his Head Coach this season or if he will end up with the same fate as Chiarelli.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/05/22/a-few-things-that-don-sweeney-needs-to-address-right-away/">A Few Things That Don Sweeney Needs to Address Right Away</a> (757 words)</p>

After his 9 year tenure at the helm of the S.S. Bruins, Chiarelli will get a fresh start in Edmonton.</p>
<p>First off, good for Peter Chiarelli. Although he could be frustrating to the fans at times, Chiarelli had a tremendously successful career in Boston. He took a flailing franchise and brought them a Stanley Cup and a perennially dominant team. He&#8217;s exactly what the Oilers could use right now- a responsible, conscientous mind that isn&#8217;t afraid to trade the pieces that don&#8217;t fit into his vision for the team.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s happened in Edmonton over the past five years has been nothing less than fascinating. They have drafted first overall three times during that span, and the others were third and seventh overall. Statistically speaking, no team has been worse during that span. And the crazy thing is, they don&#8217;t show any sign of turning that around.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/04/27/trading-lucic-to-the-oilers-makes-sense-for-both-sides/">Trading Lucic to the Oilers Makes Sense for Both Sides</a> (490 words)</p>

Photo Courtesy AP." ></a><p>Whenever a team enters a season as a favorite to be a Stanley Cup Contender and misses the playoffs, serious questions need to be asked. The Bruins, fresh of a Stanley Cup Final appearance in 2013 and a President&#8217;s Trophy in 2014 looked primed to make some serious noise in 2015. Despite losing Jarome Iginla and Johnny Boychuk prior to the season to the Avalanche and Islanders, respectively, the Bruins still looked to be a contender.</p>
<p>Expectations took a hit when the Bruins began the season 1-4 while playing a poor brand of hockey. They began to right the ship but then the injury bug hit, Boston lost Zdeno Chara and David Krejci for significant parts of the season. Despite these losses, the Bruins were still putting themselves in position to win games. The problem was they weren’t finishing. A full 60 minute effort was hard to come by and the Bruins seemed like a squad just going through the motions and waiting until the playoffs. Their play against elite competition was troubling also, going 0-4 against Montreal and 0-3 on a key west coast road trip in December.</p>
<p>A strong month on January was followed by a lackluster February that saw the team suffer another west coast losing streak, this time at four games. March was the month that finally quashed any doubts about the Bruins being contenders. Their five game losing streak in the middle of the month that included losses to three playoff teams and the league worst Sabres. Despite having a chance to sneak into the playoffs on the last day of the season, it would have been naïve to think this Bruins team would have made much noise in the postseason.</p>
<p>Several players performed well below expectations this season. The injuries to Chara and Krejci greatly affected their performance while Dennis Seidenberg and Milan Lucic only showed flashes of the players that helped bring Boston to two Cup Finals in three seasons. Gregory Campbell and Daniel Paille were ineffective and have already been informed by the team that they will not be brought back. Chris Kelly was the best player on the team through October, but came back down to Earth offensively while still contributing on defense. Reilly Smith was ineffective throughout the season and did was constantly moved around the lineup.</p>
<p>Loui Eriksson played well as did Carl Soderberg, but at times lacked the necessary physicality. Adam McQuaid was not as effective as years past and Dougie Hamilton played well but was hampered by a late season ribs injury. Patrice Bergeron and Tuukka Rask were stars for the Bruins, but unfortunately Rask had to play in 70 games because his backup, Niklas Svedberg, was woefully ineffective.</p>
<p>Three bright spots for Boston were Patrice Bergeron, David Pastrnak, and Ryan Spooner. Bergeron was an elite player as always and Pastrnak and Spooner joined the team and made heavy contributions after the All-Star break. Both could end up being major pieces of the Bruins moving forward, but the fact that the Bruins relied on two rookies for most of their offensive production was a troubling sign in itself.</p>
<p>The question now is what’s next for the Bruins in their longer than anticipated offseason. The first shoe dropped earlier this week when the team fired General Manager Peter Chiarelli. Chiarelli had been with the team since 2006 and was a major factor in building the rosters that won a Stanley Cup in 2011 and the Eastern Conference in 2013. His struggles this year were too much for the Bruins, however, and they are now looking for his replacement.</p>
<p>The Bruins will not decimate their core, but it is possible one or two longstanding Bruins could be dealt. Soderberg and McQuaid could very well join Campbell and Paille in playing elsewhere next season. Matt Bartkowski, whose tenure with Boston has left much to be desired, will also probably be wearing a different uniform next season. Zdeno Chara and Milan Lucic have been floated as potential trade names and it is possible that one of them gets dealt this offseason. Malcolm Subban, the team’s young goaltending prospect, could also be part of a deal.</p>
<p>The major question now is the fate of Coach Claude Julien. Julien, who has one Stanley Cup ring with the Bruins, will remain as coach for the time being. But a new GM could choose to make a move for a new coach, which would allow Chiarelli and Julien to reunite next season; possibly in Toronto.</p>
<p>In retrospect, the 2014-15 Bruins have no one to blame but themselves for their failure to make the playoffs. Although they were not as talented as Bruins teams from the past five seasons, they still had more than enough talent to make the postseason. One major change along with several minor ones has already been made. It seems only as though there will be more changes coming and next season’s Bruins team could look quite different from this year’s squad. It will be a long offseason in Boston.</p>

At the beginning of the season it was easy to say the more exciting team throughout the whole year would be the Bruins. They had just come off of a season where they won the President&#8217;s Trophy and made another run in the playoffs despite a disappointing finish in the second round against their hated rivals north of the border, the Montreal Canadiens. Sure, they did not replace the scoring hole left by the departure of Jarome Iginla and then they traded away Johnny Boychuk just before the season started, but they were still going to be contenders in the East if not Stanley Cup contenders. There was no way you could even try to make the comparison between the Celtics and the Bruins as to who was going to have the better season or at least be more exciting, right?</p>
<p>Well, here we are midway through February with both teams facing their upcoming trade deadlines and both teams essentially battling for the eighth spot in their respective playoff brackets. So the question on the table is: which team is more exciting right now? Who would you rather go see?(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/02/19/the-celtics-or-the-bruins-whos-the-bigger-ticket-at-the-garden/">The Celtics or the Bruins?

Milan Lucic has had a fire lit under him and since the Bruins played Pittsburgh two weeks ago he is a plus five with three goals and four assists. He is playing with his trademark physicality and aggression which has been a cornerstone of the Bruins success. Patrice Bergeron has continued his excellent play and has been rewarded as the team’s only All-Star.

They would be smart to give him a shot to play with their top line. Photo Courtesy causewayblog.com." ></a><p>The Bruins recalled rookie forward David Pastrnak from the Providence Bruins of the AHL Tuesday morning. Pastrnak had spent the previous few weeks shining at the World Juniors Tournament for the Czech Republic. Pastrnak, the 25th overall pick for the Bruins in the 2014 draft, played in five games earlier this season for the Bruins registering one assist and 14 shots.</p>
<p>Boston has been mired in a season long offensive slump and shaky play from top line forward Milan Lucic as well as shaky healthy from top line center David Krejci have exasperated the Bruins problems. Putting Pastrnak on the top line with both Lucic and Krejci could provide an offensive shot in the arm for the black and gold. He leads Providence with 10 goals this season and had one of the best goals of the tournament for the Czech Republic to win an overtime game at the World Juniors.</p>
<p>Pastrnak is young and inexperienced but he makes up for that inexperience in raw offensive talent. When in training camp with the Bruins he looked like the best young player to debut since Tyler Seguin. He is fast, smart, and has a deadly accurate shot from anywhere on the ice. He has a knack for finding open holes in the defense and making plays happen. Surely he will have growing pains but Pastrnak is the best in house option for the Bruins and would provide an instant upgrade over the solid but less talented Seth Griffith.</p>
<p>One concern for the Bruins is that if Pastrnak plays ten games in the NHL this season he would become a free agent one year earlier than if he did not. However, at this point the Bruins should be thinking about what moves give them the best chance to be  a Stanley Cup Contender in 2015 and 2016. Bringing Pastrnak up and pairing him with elite offensive talent such as Krejci&#8217;s would do just that.</p>
