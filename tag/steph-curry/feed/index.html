<p>After the Cavs were blown off the floor in game four, I along with the rest of the country had pronounced them dead. I had begun to write LeBron&#8217;s eulogy, complete with a bevy of excuses and narcissistic one-liners that he would have loved. I popped &#8220;The Godfather&#8221; in the DVD player and was prepared to watch it six times in succession as a tribute to LBJ&#8217;s willpower and mental fortitude. I even sent flowers to LeBron&#8217;s mom and step-dad, Delonte West.</p>
<p>The series was all but over. You could see it in the body language of every Cavs player. They were ready to throw in the towel and fire up the old LeBron excuse train. But then, the King finally lived up to his name. Kyrie got the party started with a tremendous individual performance in game five, and LeBron finally woke up and remembered that he is the single most unguardable player in the history of basketball.</p>
<p>No one, not even Air Jordan himself, has ever had a performance quite like King James had in these finals. I mean the guy led both teams in points, assists, rebounds, steals, and blocks for the series for christ&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>He carried the Cavs and the city of Cleveland to their first title in 52 years, and he did it against a team that was destined to be one of, if not thee greatest team of all-time. Of course, the epic comeback would not have been possible without one of the biggest collapses in the history of modern athletics. The Warriors were completely out of sync down the stretch last night, hoisting up horrible shots and hoping that Steph or Klay (The Trash Bros) would bail them out with a late prayer. Their third best player in Draymond Green outplayed both Steph and Klay for most of the series, and that can&#8217;t be the case if you want to beat a player of Bron Bron&#8217;s caliber on the big stage.</p>
<p>As much as I hate to say it, if LeBron cracked under pressure like Steph did in this series, the media would be absolutely DESTROYING him right now. That&#8217;s the price you pay when you build yourself up as one of the biggest front runners of all-time. When you lose, the blame falls squarely on your broad, freakishly muscular shoulders. But when you win, and dominate the way that LeBron did in this series, then all of the praise and credit if yours and yours alone.</p>
<p>Whatever narrative you want to write about LeBron and his career is now open for debate. The comparisons between he and Jordan that seemed all but dead just a few short months ago are now back on the table. That&#8217;s how impressive LBJ&#8217;s finals were.</p>
<p>So where does LeBron go from here? He did what he set out to do and won a championship for his city, and he did so as the best player on the floor by  wide, wide margin. Why stay? Cleveland is a dump to begin with and I&#8217;ve got to imagine that it&#8217;s burned to the ground after last night&#8217;s celebrations. Whatever he does, his legacy is now set in stone.</p>
<p>I hate you LeBron James, and I always will. Your pompous, self-absorbed demeanor will never allow me to truly respect your greatness. But finally, I can say without sarcasm, that I truly, truly respect you.</p>
<p>PS- Someone check on J.R. Smith. Like right now.</p>

I don&#8217;t think anyone, including the Warriors, thought that OKC would put up this kind of a fight against the defending world champs. Up three games to one, the Thunder were in the driver&#8217;s seat. Russell Westbrook couldn&#8217;t be stopped and was looking like the best player on the court. Kevin Durant was playing sound, efficient basketball on both ends of the floor, and the supporting cast, particularly Steven Adams, seemed to be making all the little plays that make the difference in a tight series.</p>
<p>But then, Steph Curry happened. Klay Thompson woke up from his coma and dropped 19 in the fourth quarter to force game seven. When you get a great team like the Warriors on their heels, you have to go for the jugular. Can&#8217;t let Steph and Klay hang around long enough to get hot. The role players, including Anderson Varejao, who apparently still plays basketball, and others did their part down the stretch. Oracle was LIT. Steph was crossing anyone who dared to guard him and making it look more effortless than ever. When I think about Steph Curry twenty years from now, this is the game I&#8217;ll remember. The way he, the Thunder, and everyone watching knew the ball was going in the second he came off of the screen.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got to be honest, I was starting to grow tired of all the Golden State love. ESPN constantly shoving them down our throats and social media losing their minds every time Steph hits a three. But the Warriors are just too much fun. One of the all-time great teams in sports and last night showed just what kind of resolve they really have. Can&#8217;t wait to watch them take down King James once again in the finals. I enjoy watching LeBron James lose just as much as I enjoy watching my teams win. If that&#8217;s wrong, then I don&#8217;t want to be right.</p>
<p>PS- Hey KD, you know who doesn&#8217;t play in the Western Conference with the big bad Warriors and Spurs? The Celtics. Just saying&#8230;</p>

Boston is 3-2 in their last five games with wins over Charlotte, Chicago and New Orleans, however, it may be their recent losses that are the most telling. Boston has played the two best teams in the NBA, San Antonio last week and Golden State on Friday night. Both games ended with one more in the loss column but the young Celtics team showed a lot of character and poise despite defeat. In San Antonio the Celtics looked to be out of it in the fourth quarter before a late rally to close the gap that came up short and had them lose by three as the Spurs remained undefeated at home. The Celtics bounced back to beat the Pelicans on the road and then the Bulls at home before facing the Warriors at the Garden. As expected Boston played Golden State tough, fighting them tooth and nail to force not one but two overtimes.</p>
<p>One thing that can be said about the Celtics Friday night is they took every punch from the Warriors and kept on coming. Every time they got knocked to the mat by a great play or a Steph Curry three, of which he made six, they got back up, tried to have a good possession and continued to fight. It seemed as though they truly believed they were supposed to be playing with the Warriors, it didn&#8217;t matter if no one else had beat them, they had come to Boston to lose. Ultimately Golden State did what they had done to everyone else, maintained perfection and ripped the heart out of Celtics fans with a double overtime win that felt more like a steal after all that had happened between the fourth quarter and overtime. There is, however, no doubt that the C&#8217;s had chances to win the game in regulation and OT but were just unable to capitalize.</p>
<p>In the end of regulation Isaiah Thomas had a chance to win it with a couple tics on the clock but couldn&#8217;t connect as he was well defended by the long Shaun Livingston. Brad Stevens then drew up a great inbound play for the hot-handed Kelly Olynyk to screen then pop for the potential game winning jumper, unfortunately it was a bit rushed with 0.7 seconds on the clock and with that miss on to overtime they went. In the first overtime Thomas had a better look with a floater to win it that didn&#8217;t fall and in the second OT with the Celtics down by three Jae Crowder had a chance to tie it up but was also unable to hit the shot. Ultimately the looks were there, the Celtics were just unable to knock them down.</p>
<p>Although Boston did not pull out the victory they do know they can hang with the best two teams in the NBA and give them all they want. The next step for Brad Stevens&#8217; team is to figure out how to finish those games and get the big victories. Lets face facts that a loss is never a good thing but with a team that appears to be gelling they have the opportunity to build from these losses. If anything, Boston can be confident now that they can play with anybody in the NBA, the key is the finish.</p>
<p>It appears the balanced attack is a solid approach but one does have to wonder without a go-to player is the pressure now going to be on Isaiah Thomas to take and make these shots? Is it his job to put the harpoon in and finish opponents? For better or worse the days of Paul Pierce are over, but when he was in Boston you could almost guarantee it was going to be The Captain and The Truth putting it up from the elbow or going to the rack to try and draw a foul during the final seconds of any close game.</p>
<p>Either way Boston is playing solid team basketball and should enter the matchup against LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers Tuesday night with a great deal of confidence. The matchup will be a home game for the Celtics who currently sit at 14-10 in seventh place in a tight early race in the Eastern Conference. The Cavs enter the game at 15-7, good enough for first place in the east, (they would be fourth in the Western Conference behind Golden State, San Antonio and Oklahoma City). The Cavs have stumbled a bit of late going 2-3 in their last five games with wins over Orlando and Portland but loses to Washington, Miami and New Orleans. Cleveland recently got shooting guard/wing Iman Shumpert back from an sprained wrist however still do not have All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving in the line up who is expected to potentially make his season debut next week.</p>
<p>Another great feature to this game is that there is no love loss between these two teams. Boston is a young team gunning, albeit from a distance for now, for the Cleveland crown. The C&#8217;s have played them tough despite getting swept out of the playoffs in the first round last year on Cleveland&#8217;s way to the NBA Finals. The Cavs left the City of Boston bruised, battered and down one star player after Kelly Olynyk dislocated Kevin Love&#8217;s shoulder and ended his season as well as diminished their chances for an NBA title. Jae Crowder suffered an injury of his own at the (back)hand of J.R. Smith in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference playoff series last year. Crowder suffered a vicious blow that landed him on the ground with a sprained ACL requiring rehab as the league slapped Smith with a suspension. Both teams play physical and both teams play defense, there is a good chance bodies will hit the deck tomorrow night in Boston as these teams are hungry for a win. The Cavs will be trying to maintain first place and the Celtics trying to prove they are a legitimate contender in east.</p>
<p>LeBron James, who might be one of the most physical players, and is likely one of the most physically impressive specimens the league has ever seen, is entering the game scoring 26.4 points per contest to go along with 7.7 rebounds and 6.4 assists. The superstar floor general is also getting All-Star production out of Kevin Love who is scoring a shade under 18 points per game and ripping down 11.0 rebounds a night. The supporting cast of Mo Williams filling in for the injured Kyrie Irving as well as J.R. Smith are both averaging in double figures.</p>
<p>The Celtics will need to match the Cavs physicality, trying to keep the LeBron James locomotive out of the lane and off the fast break to avoid easy buckets at the rim, free throws and foul trouble. Another apparent force is the big Russian, no not Ivan Drago, the center Timofey Mozgov. Despite his limited action he is able to score at the rim, rebound and block shots and may see a lot of time if the Celtics try to play a smaller line up with more skilled big men. Boston will need to look for Jared Sullinger to be a beast on the boards and the rest of the rotation of bigs to do their part in the trenches boxing out to avoid easy second chance points. The Celtics don&#8217;t have to be perfect to beat the Cavs but they need to play smart, grind it out on defense and get good looks on offense as points may be at a premium in this one. Boston is led in scoring by Isaiah Thomas averaging 20.8 points per game and Avery Bradley pouring in 16.3 a night and continue with a deep and balanced team having seven players averaging 9.0 or greater points per game.</p>
<p>Celtics fans have a lot to be excited about as a confident C&#8217;s team welcomes the Eastern Conference establishment, Cleveland Cavaliers, to what will be a jam-packed Garden heavily supporting this never-say-die Celtics team. Although early in the season this one will have the feel of a potential future playoff series.</p>

	<img width="443" height="300" src="https://i2.wp.com/sportsofboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Avery-Bradley-vs-Steph-Curry.jpg?fit=443%2C300&amp;ssl=1" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="www.sport.net" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/sportsofboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Avery-Bradley-vs-Steph-Curry.jpg?w=650&amp;ssl=1 650w, https://i2.wp.com/sportsofboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Avery-Bradley-vs-Steph-Curry.jpg?resize=150%2C102&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/sportsofboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Avery-Bradley-vs-Steph-Curry.jpg?resize=443%2C300&amp;ssl=1 443w, https://i2.wp.com/sportsofboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Avery-Bradley-vs-Steph-Curry.jpg?resize=200%2C135&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i2.wp.com/sportsofboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Avery-Bradley-vs-Steph-Curry.jpg?resize=130%2C88&amp;ssl=1 130w" sizes="(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px" />			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://i2.wp.com/sportsofboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Avery-Bradley-vs-Steph-Curry.jpg?fit=650%2C440&ssl=1" title="" ></a><p>The Celtics have won two in a row and four of their last five games with road wins over Miami, Sacramento, and New Orleans, as well as a solid victory at home holding off Jimmy Butler and the Bulls last night. The only loss in their last five games was a close one when Boston travelled to San Antonio and fell 108-105 to the Spurs (18-5). Boston has also notched four straight home court wins and is averaging 108.0 points per game in their last five games, this will be important if they want to have a chance against the high octane Golden State Warriors.</p>
<p>The C&#8217;s are coming off an impressive team performance against the Bulls in which eight players scored in double figures without a single one playing over 40 minutes. Isaiah Thomas again led the scoring charge with 20 points, 5 assists and 5 rebounds. Jared Sullinger continued to clean the glass with 16 rebounds to go with his 10 points and Kelly Olynyk once again provided a spark off the bench pouring in 15 points in just 20 minutes of action. Ex-Warriors big man David Lee got back in the flow last night after missing time with a bruised heel to score 12 points and snatch six rebounds. Chicago, who now sit at 11-8, third in the central division behind Cleveland and Indiana put up a fight until the final bell. Jimmy Butler dropped 36 points and nabbed seven boards while Gasol was good for a double-double in points and rebounds with 16 and 15, respectively. A face mask-wearing Derek Rose had 12 points and six assists in the loss.</p>
<p>Boston is coming into this game flying high. Success on the road plus a good win in a tight game at home has the guys in green as ready as ever for the matchup with the champs. However, there is no doubt the undefeated Warriors come into the game, despite key injuries to Harrison Barnes and Klay Thompson, with ultimate confidence. Why shouldn&#8217;t they be confident? They have stepped on the court 23 times this season and won all 23 games, it seems like everyday they are breaking or about to break another consecutive win record.</p>
<p>The matchup is interesting for many reasons, statistically the Warriors rank 1st in the NBA in offensive efficiency, 1st in 3-point FG points per game and rarely turn the ball over ranking 24th in the league in that regard. On the flip side the Celtics rank 3rd in the NBA in defensive efficiency, 4th in 3-point FG points per game and are 1st in defensive turnovers. Putting the stats on the back burner for a minute, someone that watches the Celtics can see they pass the eye test as well. This team is deep, they keep fresh legs on the floor, they have young athletes that can get up and down with Golden State to contest and try to keep them from scoring easy transition buckets, and they have the ability to defend the three point shot, at least as good as anyone can against a Warriors team with a plethora of shooters.</p>
<p>As far as offensive and defensive personnel for both teams, Steph Curry may be the best offensive player in basketball right now but the Celtics have one of the better defenders at the guard position in Avery Bradley. An interesting play may also be to try the longer Evan Turner on Curry in efforts to disrupt his hair-trigger release and to mix in different looks defensively.</p>
<p>A major advantage that Golden State has over most teams is their ability to go to the smaller line up and have success. They have so many skill players with Draymond Green perhaps being the best example. Green is someone that can bang down low and guard on the perimeter then turn around and knock down threes or drive to the basket on offense. The Celtics also have a lot of skill players and bigs that can stretch the floor making the Warriors work on defense just as they force opponents to night in and night out. Trying to keep pace in a run and gun style with the Warriors would surely be a mistake however the option to play with a smaller line up may help the Celtics manage the tempo without giving up blow-by layups and penetration on the defensive end.</p>
<p>Offensively the Celtics can help themselves by playing disciplined basketball, getting up good shots, continuing the balanced attack, and making the Warriors play defense for the majority of the shot clock. Another key will be taking care of the basketball. Carelessness will lead to layups and transitions threes and no one puts up points faster than Golden State.</p>
<p>For the Warriors, who will be going for the NBA record for most consecutive road wins, they have a big question mark named Klay Thompson. At this point he is listed as a game-time decision after tweaking his ankle in a 131-123 win over the Pacers Tuesday in which he lit them up for 39 points and went 10-16 from behind the arc. If Thompson doesn&#8217;t play and Barnes continues to sit as planned, the Celtics can focus more efforts on Curry, perhaps trying to trap him, double him, aggressively hedge screens and do anything else in their power to make him give up the basketball. This season the reigning MVP, averaging 32.2 points per game, has shown he is not just a shooter, he&#8217;s a pure scorer, a passer, and a playmaker with other worldly handles. Steph Curry and the team basketball culture this Golden State team brings out each night is truly a spectacle and a treat for all basketball fans. Most of the time Curry has the ball on a string and during this win streak seems to be making all the right decisions with the rock. However with increased pressure from a barrage of Celtics defenders and his one and two wing options in suit coats he will have to be special to create for himself and make plays for teammates. If Thompson does play the task will be a tall one for Boston but with the spirit of this young, hungry Celtics team its unlikely they would want it any other way.</p>
<p>If the Warriors are able to get by the Celtics they play their next four games against teams with records of .500 or worse before the Christmas Day NBA Finals rematch against Lebron James and the Cavaliers at Oracle Arena in Oakland. The Warriors have remained humble and hungry on this record setting season which will serve them well as Brad Stevens will have the Celtics geared up and locked in for what is sure to be a raucous TD Garden on Friday night in Boston. Tip-off is set for 7:30 as the C&#8217;s try to dethrone the undefeated and undisputed heavyweight champs of the NBA.</p>

<p>As painful as it was to be forced to recall that deeply suppressed memory, it made me somewhat giddy. Was I about to see Lebron go full supernova to save the Cleveland Cavaliers season and force a Game 7? Without having it come at the expense of my own team? Was anything even out of the realm of possibility?</p>
<p>When the final horn sounded, Lebron&#8217;s stat line didn&#8217;t disappoint: 36 points, 15 rebounds, 9 assists, just shy of his third triple double of the Finals. But somehow his performance still was disappointing, as the Golden State Warriors withheld a furious JR Smith heat check 3-point barrage in the final minutes to end the franchise&#8217;s 40 year title drought.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/06/17/lebron-falls-short-as-warriors-end-40-year-nba-title-drought/">Lebron Falls Short as Warriors End 40 Year NBA Title Drought</a> (618 words)</p>
