				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here at Sports of Boston, we want to keep the focus on sports and stay away from politics. Politics are just too divisive and too emotional. Sports arguments usually have just a few angles. Political arguments have angles, levels, agendas, religions and more beliefs that I want to mention here. As a website, we had to contribute something. So, I decided I would give an opinion that to me is not about politics. It’s about common sense.</p>
<p>I am the father of two beautiful girls, both under the age of ten. They are my life; they are my greatest joys and the source of constant worry. Every morning I drop them off at school and I watch them walk through the front door. For me and many parents, it will be hard in the coming months and years not to think of Newtown, Connecticut when we say good-bye in the morning as our children begin their school day. When I was their age, I used to walk to school with my friends. Some afternoons I walked home by myself. Those times were different and we worry more today because we have been raised in a world where that worry is legitimate.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2012/12/18/regarding-newtown-there-are-no-words-but-maybe-we-can-do-better/">Regarding Newtown, There are No Words, but Maybe We Can Do Better</a> (808 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The elementary school shooting that occurred December 14, 2012 will always be remembered as a horrific tragedy, one that will likely spark a number of political and social debates, such as gun control and treatment for those with mental illness.</p>
<p>However, after reading numerous Twitter and Facebook posts following the incident in Newtown, Connecticut, I believe another troublesome issue has arisen from the event, one concerning the way we interact with one another after such tragedies. Postings of thoughts and prayers going out to the families affected are frequent and heartfelt, but the confrontational dialogue between individuals on their ideas for reform is becoming problematic. Many are reacting with anger, which is an understandable tributary in the range of emotions stemming from initial sadness and shock. However, it is important to remember that no matter how often these tragedies seem to occur, our anger should not be misplaced onto each other and we should never express shame over living in a country or world where such travesties take place.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2012/12/15/a-reaction-to-the-newtown-connecticut-shooting/">A Reaction to the Newtown, Connecticut Shooting</a> (242 words)</p>
