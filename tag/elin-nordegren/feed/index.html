<p>Back in November, Tiger crashed his vehicle into a tree outside his home, and was later revealed to have been fooling around with more than a dozen other women while married to his beautiful wife, Elin Nordegren.</p>
<p>Tiger is expected to speak to a group of associates, and the media will be allowed to listen in. Of course, per Tiger&#8217;s PR department, he will not be taking any questions. Yeah, that&#8217;s a shocker.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/02/17/tiger-woods-to-break-silence-talk-on-friday/">Tiger Woods to Break Silence, Talk on Friday</a> (203 words)</p>

What would former Bruins coach Pat Burns know about the Tiger Woods saga? Apparently, he knows the entire story.</p>
<p>While appearing for his daily interview with CKAC Sports radio in Montreal on Tuesday, Burns, a former Quebec police officer, was told by police acquaintances in Florida that Elin Nordegren hit her husband, Tiger Woods, <strong>in the face with a golf club</strong> after reading text messages on Tiger&#8217;s cell phone from one of his mistresses. The swing left Woods with a deep gash in his cheek and two missing front teeth. Woods then tried to leave the house via his SUV, but his wifeÂ  chased after him and swung at his car, smashing his rear windshield and causing him to crash.</p>
<p>Burns said that Tiger was not immediately available to police following the accident because he was in Phoenix, Arizona getting emergency dental and plastic surgery to fix his injuries. Elin, meanwhile, has been enjoying her time away from Tiger, including a stay in Europe for her recent birthday. Neither Woods or his wife has commented publicly about the incident.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/01/06/pat-burns-tiger-woods-lost-teeth-after-wife-hit-him-with-golf-club/">Pat Burns: Tiger Woods Lost Teeth After Wife Hit Him With Golf Club</a> (110 words)</p>

Even if you spent the better part of the year huffing glue and can&#8217;t recall much of the goings on here, there have been enough âYear in Reviewâ stories over the past few weeks to fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>Now, with our hangovers subsiding, work and school continuing and hopefully our debilitating huffing habits behind us, it&#8217;s time we look forward. What are the big stories in Boston in 2010? Who are the movers and shakers? Whatâs the big scandal? Well look no further, Sports of Boston has you covered. I took a peak into my proverbial crystal ball, and got a glance at what I think will be the big stories of year.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2>January</h2>
<p>After the Pats lose in the in second round of the playoffs, people start to question Belichickâs coaching ability and some even call for his firing. In response, Belichick calls a press conference to remind everyone what bad coaching truly looks like. Refusing to make a comment or answer questions, he simply places photos of Grady Little, Pete Carroll and Rick Pitino on the podium and walks away. Everybody gets the point and shuts the hell up.</p>
<h2>February</h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The NHL breaks for two weeks for the Winter Olympics. While Bruins stars Patrice Bergeron, Zdeno Chara, Marco Sturm, David Krejci, Tim Thomas and the newly inked Miroslav Satan <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/12/30/bruins-bergeron-chara-krejci-and-sturm-named-olympians/" target="_blank">head off to Vancouver to skate for their respective countries</a>, the remaining B&#8217;s are able to indulge in activities that they normally wouldn&#8217;t have time for during the regular season&#8211;such as winning consecutive hockey games.

<p>Since Tiger decided to release his pent-up <a href="http://assets.nydailynews.com/img/2009/11/30/gal_tiger_woods_19.jpg">hatred for luxury SUVâs</a> by <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/11/27/tiger-woods-injured-in-car-accident/">ramming his into a tree a couple weeks ago</a>, news of the legendary golferâs extramarital affairs have been the topic of fodder on every channel from ESPN to CNN. And even though his sexual conquests and <strong>decision to step away from golf for a while</strong> have little to do with anything going on here in the Bay State, we here at Sports of Boston could hardly consider ourselves upstanding members of the Fourth Estate without weighing in on this torrid tale of sexual escapades.</p>
<p>Woods&#8217; number of alleged mistresses is quickly climbing into the teens, and nine of them have been identified. Personally, I find this reprehensible. Tiger Woods, a man with a previously spotless reputation, a man with a gorgeous wife and children, turns out to have multiple mistresses, and no one, I mean no one, has even bothered to put together a list ranking these ladies. That&#8217;s just plain wrong, and I intend on righting this injustice.
