<p>Days after losing its No. 1 prospect <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2011/02/01/boston-college-loses-top-recruit-graham-stewart-to-florida/">Graham Stewart</a> to Florida, Boston College bounced back and signed a total of 23 prospects Wednesday. At the top of the list includes, Albert Louis-Jean, Brian Miller, Connor Wujciak and Steven Daniels. Head Coach Frank Spaziani understands as much as the next coach that football games are won up front. With that in mind, 11 of the 23 commits were offensive or defensive lineman.</p>
<p>Still, Spaziani and company managed to land a couple of big-play threats offensively. Curt Evans, of Hollywood, Fla., was highly coveted as he fielded 19 scholarship offers from big-time football programs like Michigan, Ole Miss, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Stanford. At the quarterback position, Spaziani landed Christian Suntrup, who has been committed since May 2008. Suntrup went the Boston College route, over places like Stanford and Nebraska.

Strong was the defensive coordinator at the University of Florida for seven years, where in that span, the Gators won multiple National Championships. Strong was a big part of the recruiting machine that was in Gainesville, as he helped bring in the likes of Janoris Jenkins, Joe Haden, Brandon Spikes, Carlos Dunlap and Major Wright &#8212; all players, who compete in the NFL today.</p>
<p>Now, in just his first year with full recruiting leverage, Strong landed arguably the biggest recruit in Louisville football history.</p>
<p>Teddy Bridgewater, a Miami native, was a long-time University of Miami commit, however things changed with the firing of Randy Shannon. Like in many cases when a coach leaves a program, many recruits start to look elsewhere in their college search. Bridgewater proceeded to field offers from big-time football programs in the best overall conference like, Florida, LSU and Tennessee.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/12/22/a-strong-turnaround-louisville-lands-top-recruit-bridgewater/">A Strong Turnaround: Louisville Lands Top Recruit Bridgewater</a> (321 words)</p>
