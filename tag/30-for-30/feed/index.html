Did they do it justice? (Globe Staff Photo / Jim Davis)" ></a><p>&#8220;Four Days in October&#8221; is Gary Waksman&#8217;s contribution to ESPN&#8217;s &#8220;30 For 30&#8221; short-documentary film series. The movie isolates Games 3 through 7 of the 2004 American League Championship Series between the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees. Using a combination of player interviews, archival MLB footage, home video by players and a conversation between ESPN columnist Bill Simmons and Boston comedian Lenny Clarke, the movie retells how the Red Sox became the first team in MLB history to come back from an 0-3 deficit and win a seven-game series.</p>
<p>The problem with &#8220;Four Days in October&#8221; is that it&#8217;s been told before. We all saw David Ortiz&#8217;s game-winning hits, Mark Bellhorn&#8217;s three-run home run, Alex Rodriguez&#8217;s slap, and Johnny Damon&#8217;s grand slam. Bill Simmons said in the movie that &#8220;at some point it became like a life experience.&#8221; This is absolutely true. The problem the movie suffers from is that when you have a &#8220;life experience,&#8221; you never forget it. Every Red Sox fan knows this story. Each person knows where he or she was, who he or she was with, and how he or she reacted. And while it&#8217;s nice to have a little reminder that this event happened, it&#8217;s not like anyone&#8217;s close to forgetting it. Fifty years from now, after a few generations come and go, maybe someone will make a nice little nostalgia-piece about the four games that may have permanently changed the Red Sox organization and its fans. But this film aired not even six years after the 2004 ALCS. Who&#8217;s watching this film that doesn&#8217;t already know all about this?(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/10/05/espn-30-for-30-four-days-in-october-been-there-won-that/">ESPN 30 For 30: &#8220;Four Days in October&#8221; &#8211; Been There, Won That</a> (642 words)</p>
