<p>The worst stat on Price is his average against with runners in scoring position, an average of .371, a slugging percentage of .686, and an OPS of 1.070.  When your ace is getting payed 31 million dollars this season you need him to get the big strikeout in the tough spots, Price simply does not.  Last night with the Sox going for the sweep, with the rival Yankees in town, and a playoff atmosphere, Price did go 7 innings, however, he did give up 6 earned runs on 8 hits and only 3 strikeouts.  Every time the Sox got the lead, he would give it up.  Price needs to back off from social media and concentrate on the task at hand, which is earning his money.</p>
<p>All of us Red Sox fans can only hope that as the weather heats up so does the Red Sox so called &#8220;ace&#8221;.</p>

Spring Training is usually more of a fleeting tease than legitimate action, but there if one pays attention there are still lessons to be learned. With that in mind, we&#8217;ve come up with a list of nine items/storylines to keep track of down in Ft. Myers (we&#8217;ve intentionally excluded <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=5409&amp;position=3B" target="_blank">Pablo Sandoval</a>&#8216;s weight problem, because that should surprise no one).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Other options at Third Base</strong> &#8211; Sandoval&#8217;s conditioning and physical shape are always going to be a problem, so no one should have been shocked when he showed up looking like he had just eaten <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8370&amp;position=2B" target="_blank">Dustin Pedroia</a> for breakfast and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=9345&amp;position=2B/3B/OF" target="_blank">Brock Holt</a> for lunch. Sandoval&#8217;s contract also essentially makes the starting job at Third his to lose, but there is a possibility that he takes himself out of the running for everyday playing time if his performance falls off a cliff. It would be interesting to know who might stand to benefit from more available playing time at the hot corner should the need arise. The early guess would most likely be Holt, due to his experience at the position, although <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=11982&amp;position=1B" target="_blank">Travis Shaw</a> saw limited action at Third last season so he at least has experience there as well.</li>
<li><strong>How will the bridge to <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=11982&amp;position=1B" target="_blank">Craig Kimbrel</a> be composed</strong> &#8211; We already know that the Red Sox main setup core will consist of at least <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=13172&amp;position=P" target="_blank">Carson Smith</a> and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=9227&amp;position=P" target="_blank">Koji Uehara</a>, with <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=4079&amp;position=P" target="_blank">Junichi Tazawa</a> also likely to see some setup work as well. What will be interesting to see is how exactly those pitchers are deployed Early reports have Uehara scheduled to pitch the eighth inning, while Smith and Tazawa split duties in earlier innings as the situation demands. However, an argument could be made that it might be better for the Red Sox to more evenly divide the setup duties between those three relievers based more on situations and health, in order to keep everyone fresh deep into the season. Of course, this will also depend on how deep into games Red Sox starters can manage to go. The bottom line is that Uehara is coming off of a pretty major injury going into his age-41 season, Tazawa was shut down last season due to fatigue, and Smith is too good to relegate to middle-relief innings.</li>
<li><strong>Who plays most in the Outfield</strong> &#8211; We already know that some combination of <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=17016&amp;position=OF" target="_blank">Rusney Castillo</a>, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=12984&amp;position=OF" target="_blank">Jackie Bradley Jr.</a>, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=13611&amp;position=OF" target="_blank">Mookie Betts</a>, and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=3882&amp;position=OF" target="_blank">Chris Young</a> will be taking almost all of the time in the Outfield, but it is still fairly wide open as to how starts will be distributed among those players. Young will most likely see just about any left-handed starter, so that takes one of the other three out of the lineup. Betts will probably get the most starts, since he is a dynamic leadoff piece and fits perfectly in front of Pedroia and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=12161&amp;position=SS" target="_blank">Xander Bogaerts</a>. It seems like Castillo is the x-factor here, since he is still relatively unknown and has just as much bust potential as boom potential.</li>
<li><strong>Who wins the fifth starter job</strong> &#8211; Unfortunately this is probably <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=9761&amp;position=P" target="_blank">Joe Kelly</a>&#8216;s job to lose. He has a &#8220;live arm&#8221; and &#8220;great stuff,&#8221; and all of those other cliche&#8217;s baseball people like to use, but Kelly has been mediocre at best since coming to Boston. It is true that Kelly can throw hard and look dominant at times, but it is also true that he has absolutely no ability to read hitters or keep them off balance. Kelly is more of a thrower than a pitcher, and there is no reason why he should be guaranteed a rotation job this season. The Red Sox owe it to themselves to at least let one of the the younger pitchers like <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=13143&amp;position=P" target="_blank">Henry Owens</a> or Brian Johnson compete for a rotation spot in camp.</li>
<li><strong>How long of a leash does Joe Kelly get</strong> &#8211; In the likely event that Kelly does win a rotation spot, how long can he struggle before the Red Sox decide enough is enough? We have already covered how the Red Sox bullpen is improved, but it will not be able to stand Kelly lasting three to four innings per start every fifth day like he has in the past. The Red Sox do have alternatives available if Kelly struggles, and if they are serious about winning in 2016, they will not hesitate to go to them if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>How will the catching situation play out</strong> &#8211; This is a topic we will go into a bit more depth on later in the week, but it bears watching. The Red Sox have two of the best young catchers in the game in <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=13176&amp;position=C" target="_blank">Blake Swihart</a> and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=9774&amp;position=C" target="_blank">Christian Vazquez</a>, but Swihart is still young and Vazquez is coming off of a major injury. This makes it likely that Vazquez will start the season in Pawtucket, with Swihart and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=4952&amp;position=C" target="_blank">Ryan Hanigan</a> sharing time behind the dish. But if Vazquez plays well in Pawtucket, or if the other two struggle while Vazquez proves he is healthy, there could be an uncomfortable catching situation at Fenway Park this summer.</li>
<li><strong>Will the Red Sox add another left-handed reliever</strong> &#8211; There is no real need to do this yet, since guys like <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=12673&amp;position=P" target="_blank">Roenis Elias</a>, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=7501&amp;position=P" target="_blank">Tommy Layne</a>, and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=6819&amp;position=P" target="_blank">Robbie Ross</a> will all be in camp. Those are not household names by any stretch, but the Red Sox already have their most important relief innings taken care of, so they should need to worry less about a dominating lefty as long as the guys they do have can do a respectable job in the earlier innings.</li>
<li><strong>Does <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8001&amp;position=SS" target="_blank">Hanley Ramirez</a> even know what a First Baseman&#8217;s mitt looks like</strong> &#8211; Hanley could make or break the Red Sox&#8217; season at First Base, but for the love of all that is good can he at least get his own glove? Hanley has two only two simple responsibilities for the Red Sox in 2016: rake at the plate, and catch the ball when people throw it at him. Even he should be able to figure those out.</li>
<li><strong>How painful will <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=745&amp;position=DH" target="_blank">David Ortiz</a>&#8216;s &#8220;farewell tour&#8221; be</strong> &#8211; Extremely. It was bad enough having to hear about the Derek Jeter nonsense and it seems like these farewell tours have become some kind of PR monster. Can&#8217;t wait until the Oakland A&#8217;s give Ortiz a chair to sit in while his teammates play defense, or the Tampa Bay Rays give him some kind of orange-based thing to stay healthy while he bashes their pitchers all over the ballpark.</li>
