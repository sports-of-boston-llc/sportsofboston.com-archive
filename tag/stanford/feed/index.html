It is not much of a stretch to say that LSU should have been losing 21-0 to Georgia in the SEC Championship. When Tyrann Mathieu returned a punt for a touchdown to make it 10-7, I knew Georgia was done.</p>
<p>The fact that the Tigers went on to win 42-10 is a testament to how perfect you need to be against them. Georgia had them on their heels and couldn’t knock them down. They then did not score another point.</p>
<p>More notably, LSU has beaten three schools (Oregon, West Virginia and Alabama) that are playing in BCS bowls. Arkansas, the next most impressive skin on their belt, is playing in the Cotton Bowl, the most BCS-y non-BCS bowl.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Alabama</strong><br />
I am as much in favor of destroying the BCS as the next rational person, but I’m having trouble coming up with a strong argument against Alabama playing in the BCS Championship.</p>
<p>I understand that they didn’t win their conference or even their division, but that is a matter of circumstance. They’re still the second best team in the country.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Oklahoma State</strong><br />
.0086 points. Alas.</p>

I’ve seen all I need to see from LSU. If the NCAA inexplicably decided to end the season today and crown LSU the champion, I would be completely in favor of it.</p>
<p>The SEC Championship and BCS Championship don’t even matter to me, because I am that sure LSU is the best team in the country. They’ve been dominant all season, and have come through in all of their big games.</p>
<p>They’ve won all three games they’ve played against teams in the top four, two of them overwhelmingly. They’ve beaten the best teams in the Pac-12 and Big East along with the best the SEC has to offer.</p>
<p>Once they beat Georgia in the SEC Championship, they will have done just about everything they can possibly do.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Alabama</strong><br />
Alabama is also good at football. Given my decision a couple weeks ago to join War Eagle in cheering for the Iron Bowl, I should be upset that Alabama won so soundly.</p>
<p>I’m not though, because that is what I would expect from this team.</p>

<p>3. <strong>Alabama</strong><br />
We can’t possibly have a rematch in the BCS Championship, could we? What would that prove? When Oklahoma State loses to Oklahoma, will that open the door for Alabama to be No. 2, or will Oklahoma leap over them? Similarly, if Stanford beats Oregon, will they jump Alabama?</p>
<p>4. <strong>Stanford</strong><br />
Yes, they will. The Stanford-Oregon game this week is huge, but I still can’t get excited for it. Why must Andrew Luck must be so boringly efficient?</p>

2. <strong>Alabama</strong><br />
How perfectly has this matchup been set up this season? At the beginning of the season, the SEC West emerged as the country’s most difficult division. These two teams then almost immediately separated themselves from the rest of the country.</p>
<p>It was apparent early on that they were the class of the country, and we’ve seen nothing to change that view. They’ve dominated everyone they’ve played, and there’s been nary a competitive game on their schedule, despite a preponderance of competitive teams.</p>
<p>On top of that, they both have a bye week before this game? It’s like The Great BCS Computer In The Sky scripted this schedule itself.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Oklahoma State</strong><br />
Well, that was a resounding win over Baylor. Are they really the third best team in the country though? After LSU and Alabama, my mind doesn’t immediately go to Oklahoma State. I almost feel like, given the difference between LSU, Alabama, and everyone else, third place should be left vacant. I’m fine with Oklahoma State at No. 4.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Stanford</strong><br />
USC was Stanford’s first worthy opponent of the season, and the Cardinal needed three overtimes to beat them. That does not feel like the performance of a future National Champion.</p>

(Associated Press/Rick Osentoski)" ></a><p>1. <strong>Oklahoma</strong> (37)<br />
With the win over Florida State, Oklahoma took three first place votes each from Alabama and LSU. They also looked like a team that could win the BCS Championship. Great analyst that I am, I believe they are a really good football team.</p>
<p>2. <strong>LSU</strong> (14)<br />
After their win over Mississippi State definitively proved that they are probably one of the best gulf coast schools this year, LSU once again jumped Alabama. These two have leaped each other every week, with the team who beat a higher ranked opponent taking the No. 2 spot each time. This week might put that trend to the test though, with LSU playing No. 16 West Virginia and Alabama playing No. 14 Arkansas.</p>
<p>If both teams win and Alabama jumps LSU, I might need to track one of these voters down. For an interview of course.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Alabama</strong> (7)<br />
LSU has looked better than Alabama this season, but the Crimson Tide has still looked dominant. Alabama is outscoring its opponents 116-18 this season, which includes a win at then-ranked Penn State.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Boise State</strong> (2)<br />
40-15 over Toledo? Business as usual. Kellen Moore completing 79 percent of his passes this year? Also business as usual. I champion America’s Team every week because of this devastating efficiency. Don’t let their isolation among the potatoes or lack of BCS conference affiliation sway you. They are really good.</p>
