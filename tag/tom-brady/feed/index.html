<p>After giving up 49 points last week The Rams defense was on the ropes, and as a whole I&#8217;m sure they were a team that was looking to get home after back to back games in the pacific time zone.  The Patriots scored on their first possession, a 4th and 1 rush by LeGarrette Blount that went for 43 yards and a touchdown.  Then they scored early in the second on a touchdown pass from Tom Brady to Chris Hogan, however after this the offense hit a wall.</p>
<p>The Patriots average 3.1 offensive touchdowns per game, yesterday they scored 2 and struggled to do so.  Without Gronk the offense doesn&#8217;t thrive like they should.  Not having that big body in the middle of the field hurts them, Gronk is a matchup nightmare, he does things on the football field that most guys can only dream of doing.  The Patriots always preach about finishing drives off with touchdowns, well yesterday they kicked 4 field goals.  When the playoffs come around you have to score touchdowns, not kick field goals.  On the season The Patriots have been stellar on 3rd downs.  They are 6th in the league with a conversion rate of 44.5%.  Yesterday they were 4-12 on third down.  When Brady needs a completion he looks for his hall of fame tight end, and when he&#8217;s not there things change.</p>
<p>The Patriots are still the favorites in the AFC, but without Gronk it levels the playing field.  The defense will have to play more like it did yesterday, and multiple guys are going to have to step up on offense to pick up the slack of Gronk not being there.</p>

<p>As of now we&#8217;ve all seen the Brady hype videos, and starting tomorrow we finally get to live it.  Let&#8217;s face it, it&#8217;s been a long 4 weeks.  Jimmy G and Jacoby Brissett did their jobs, even tho Garoppolo should have played last week but that&#8217;s a discussion for another time.  However as of tomorrow we don&#8217;t have to worry about those two anymore (hopefully).  Tomorrow we finally get our hall of fame quarterback, back on the field where he belongs.</p>
<p>The Players or Brady himself won&#8217;t say what tomorrow will be like, but lets face it they&#8217;re going to try to give the middle finger to the rest of the league.  Do I think Brady could be rusty?  Well yes, any player who hasn&#8217;t seen game action in nearly 5 weeks will be rusty.  What I do know is Brady is pissed off, he won&#8217;t tell you how he feels but his father will.  Brady&#8217;s father has multiple times called Goodell a &#8220;liar&#8221;, and has called the NFL &#8220;a kangaroo court&#8221;.  If Brady&#8217;s dad is this upset imagine how his son feels?  Brady was booed at the Super Bowl 50 ceremony, had his name dragged through the dirt for nearly the past 2 years, has heard all the talk about Garoppolo will be Brady&#8217;s successor, and all the talk that Brady is just a &#8220;system quarterback&#8221;.</p>
<p>Remind you this is a guy who has a clock in his house.  This clock is not set to his wife&#8217;s birthday, his kids birthdays, his anniversary, or any other significant moment in his or his loved ones lives.  This clock in his house is set to February 5th, 2017, 6:30 pm.  This is the date and time of Superbowl 51.  Where he expects to be.  For a guy that has played his whole career with a chip on his shoulder, now he has a boulder on it.  Expect the revenge tour to start tomorrow and there&#8217;s no telling when it will end.  Sleep good tonight New England fans, tomorrow football Jesus is back.</p>
<p>Pats -42, Cleveland-10.</p>

<p>Who is the favorite to win Super Bowl 51? New England? Seattle? Who is the smart pick? Dallas or Oakland? Is there a longshot team that could upset the chalk for the Lombardi Trophy? Maybe the New York Giants are the underdog pick? <a href="http://www.betphoenix.ag/news/nfl/super-bowl-51-picks-10108" target="_blank">Read more&#8230;</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Tom Brady is officially free.  After Serving his four game suspension, Brady is set to start Oct<a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2016/10/03/brady-is-back/brady-4/" rel="attachment wp-att-87959"><img class="alignright wp-image-87959" src="https://i1.wp.com/sportsofboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brady.jpg?resize=247%2C164&#038;ssl=1" alt="Brady" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/sportsofboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brady.jpg?resize=451%2C300&amp;ssl=1 451w, https://i1.wp.com/sportsofboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brady.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/sportsofboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brady.jpg?resize=200%2C133&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/sportsofboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brady.jpg?resize=130%2C86&amp;ssl=1 130w, https://i1.wp.com/sportsofboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brady.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 247px) 100vw, 247px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>ober 9<sup>th</sup> against the Cleveland Browns.  The fans are excited, the players are excited, and I’m sure Tom himself is thrilled to be back on that field with his teammates.  During Brady’s absence, the Patriots posted a 3-1 record with back up quarterbacks Jimmy Garrappolo and Jacoby Brissett.  If you told me at the beginning of the season that Garrappolo would get hurt and the Patriots would still be 3-1, I wouldn’t believe you.  People were definitely a little nervous about how they would play without Brady but as a team they exceeded expectations.  Yes, it would have been great if they beat Rex Ryan and the Buffalo Bills yesterday and went 4-0 but unfortunately Garrappolo wasn’t healthy enough to play and Brissett looked a little banged up to.  Honestly the whole team didn’t look ready to play yesterday which is unusual to see from the Patriots.  Don’t get too happy though Rex, Brady and the Patriots will be back looking for Revenge on October 30<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>In my mind I think Garrappolo not starting yesterday is a little bit of a disappointment.  Look I’m not a doctor, nor have I had that injury before but I feel like if you want to become an elite Quarterback in the NFL you have to try and play through that injury.  There were some reports that the Patriots were trying to push him to play the Thursday night game against the Texans, which I thought was unrealistic because that was only four days after suffering that injury.  After rehabbing for two weeks though, I thought he was going to play.  He was practicing throughout the week and throwing the ball pretty well.  Playing through injuries show toughness in a Quarterback and it’s usually the elites one that do it.  For example, Brady has played with that injury, Russell Wilson played through an injury this week, and Big Ben always it’s a little knocked up but most of the time he’s out there playing.  Again, I don’t know how bad the injury was but it would’ve been good to see potentially your future Quarterback showing some toughness.  This was also his last chance to really show the league what he can do.  Now unless Brady gets injured, which would absolutely be devastating, who knows when Jimmy will get his next shot to prove to the league how good he is.</p>
<p>It’s only Monday, but I’m sure me and thousands of Patriots fans already can’t wait for next Sunday.  Bradys back, Ninkovich is back, and hopefully the real Gronk is back.  Good luck Cleveland, your going to need it.</p>

He did it all without his number one wideout in Kelvin Benjamin, who will be ready to go for the 2016 campaign. Many think that Cam will regress back to the mean this year, as he won&#8217;t be forced to run as often with an improved offensive line and the return of some key contributors in the passing game. That being said, I&#8217;m of the belief that Cam is poised for another monster year in 2016. He made tremendous strides in term of accuracy and pocket presence last season, and at the ripe young age of 27, he still has room to grow in all aspects of his game. If Cam can continue to develop as a passer, use his legs when the opportunity presents itself, and avoid the kind of injuries that have thwarted his fantasy potential over the years, he should be an absolute stud once again in 2016.</p>
<p>2.) <strong>Aaron Rodgers</strong>&#8211; The longtime &#8220;King of Fantasy QB&#8217;s&#8221; was finally dethroned this past season, but that doesn&#8217;t mean he isn&#8217;t poised for another big year in 2016. Last year, Rodgers finished a disappointing 7th in QB rankings, (ESPN scoring) so conventional wisdom might suggest that he&#8217;s not the fantasy superstar we&#8217;ve grown accustomed to over the years. Well in the words of my guy Lee Corso &#8220;Not so fast my friends!&#8221;. Rodgers less-than-stellar numbers can be attributed to a number of factors, the least of which have to do with his play or ability. First off, his receiving corps were held together by glue and popsicle sticks, with Jordy Nelson out for the entire year and Randall Cobb battling a bevy of injuries over the course of the season. Secondly, Rodgers once stud RB1 Eddie Lacy took one too many trips to PF Chang&#8217;s last offseason and quickly became one big, fat punchline. Eddie Lacy wasn&#8217;t just football fat, he was &#8220;Jonah Hill pre-21 Jump Street fat&#8221;. Luckily for Rodgers, Nelson appears as though he&#8217;ll be ready to start the year and Lacy has popped in the &#8220;Kanye West get right for the summer workout tape&#8221; and has slimmed down considerably. Given those developments and the fact that Rodgers is still the most gifted thrower in the league, he should once again return to fantasy dominance in 2016.</p>
<p>3.) <strong>Tom Brady + Replacement Level QB-</strong> Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know that Tom is suspended for the first four games of the year for the horrendous acts he committed against humanity. I know that most quarterbacks would be at a tremendous disadvantage having missed the first four games of the season, and I know that it might take Tom and the boys a few weeks to truly get firing on all cylinders.  What I also know is that Tom Brady put together a stellar 2015 campaign that saw him finish 2nd among QB&#8217;s in points (ESPN scoring) and throw for the most touchdowns (36) and the least interceptions (7) among starting quarterbacks. He did all of this while missing his number one wide receiver in Julian Edelman for a majority of the season, as well as emerging pass-catching threat Dion Lewis. Consider these factors along with the common knowledge that Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all-time, and you can begin to see why I am so high on him despite his four game suspension. Brady will also benefit from the return of left tackle Nate Solder as well as offensive line coach Dante Scarnecchia, who should help to remedy the Patriots porous offensive line that allowed Brady to be sacked 38 times in 2015. When Brady does finally take the field, he will be more motivated than ever to prove that Deflategate was one giant hoax from the start, and that he and the Patriots are still the big, bad bullies on the block. Drafting a QB in the later rounds with a favorable schedule weeks 1-4 (something I will get into in my draft strategy column)  along with Brady could result in the highest scoring QB for you and your team in 2016. A pissed off Tom Brady offense will be running up the score every chance they get, and that will be sure to render big time fantasy numbers this coming season.</p>

Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski, to be specific. The pair has combined for 65 touchdowns throughout the seven years Gronkowski has been in the league, titanic numbers for two players that were not drafted in the first round. Compare those 65 touchdowns to Joe Montana and Jerry Rice, who scored 67 times together (over nine years).</p>
<p>Are Gronk and Brady the best QB-TE duo of all time? Yes. Are they the best QB-receiver duo of all time? Most likely not (this year), but if the production stays at a high level, expect Brady and Gronk to finish with around 90 total touchdown connections.</p>
<p>These stats and more contribute to the reasoning behind NFL players voting for the QB in the two spot, and the tight end in the nine spot. Both are well-deserved, and some Patriots fans expressed distaste that Gronk was not higher, above players such as Julio Jones and Aaron Rodgers.</p>
<p>Also making the list was Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman, coming off a season hindered by a broken foot. Edelman, once described as the toughest cover in the NFL, is the type of blue collar worker that New Englanders love. Number eleven takes hits across the middle, has a nose for the end zone, and always places the team first. His true return this year, as opposed to his return in the postseason against KC, should bring about another 7 touchdowns for himself and Brady, once Brady returns in week 5 against Cleveland. Edelman cracked the list at number 87.</p>

<p><strong>The Red Sox</strong></p>
<p>With the all-star break behind us it&#8217;s time for The Sox to focus on the second half of the season.  The Red Sox started on the road against their arch rival Yankees who are having a terrible year.  Stephen Wright got the ball in game 1 of the series and was well rested since he wasn&#8217;t allowed to pitch in the all-star game, (Which is another story in itself).  The Yankees couldn&#8217;t touch Wright until the 6th inning, but with Boston bats hitting 3 Homeruns it was to much for The Yankees to handle.  Game 2 of the series was all about Eduardo Rodriguez, he went 7 innings while only giving up 1 earned run.  Oh, and Sandy Leon hit a 3 run homerun, what a find he has been for this team.  It is important The Sox get all the wins they can now, the end of their season is a gauntlet with more than half of their games on the road.</p>
<p><strong>The Celtics</strong></p>
<p>Trade rumors have been all the talk in Boston.  Blake Griffin? Russell Westbrook? Jahlil Okafor?  Nobody really knows if The Celtics will make a deal, and who it will be for.  As a Celtic fan you have to be excited, there&#8217;s hope around this team right now.  If The Celtics are to land one of these players I think they&#8217;ll be seeing Cleveland in The Eastern Conference Finals.</p>
<p><strong>The Patriots</strong></p>
<p>Jimmy Garoppolo is the starting quarterback for The Patriots for the first four games of the season.  There has been mixed feelings around if Brady made the right decision or not.  However, taking the suspension now is the smart play, I&#8217;d rather have Brady missing the first four then the last four.  This suspension will also be good for this teams future, either the league sees that Garoppolo can be a starter in this league and we trade him.  Garoppolo plays really well and Belichick keeps him around to one day take over for Brady. Or worst case scenario, Garoppolo plays terrible and The Pats start off the season with a losing record.  All and all I think The Pats will be just fine, and that a pissed off Brady coming back is bad for the NFL.</p>

Tommy, Tom, Tom. We had a good fight, didn&#8217;t we? We ruffled some feathers, tangled with authority, and left nearly no stone unturned in an effort to clear the name of the greatest quarterback of all-time. But in the end, there was nothing even the GOAT himself could do to combat the outright hypocrisy and lunacy of one Roger Goodell. The battle to prove Tom&#8217;s innocence was underhanded and unfair from the jump, and I for one think it&#8217;s time to move forward with Garappolo under-center for weeks 1-4.</p>
<p>When this whole Deflategate fiasco began some 543 days ago, it appeared as though Tom Brady would have an opportunity to prove what he has maintained since day one&#8211; that he had no knowledge regarding the deflation of footballs during the 2014 AFC Championship game. Throughout this exhausting legal process, it started to become clear that Tom&#8217;s innocence would have no bearing on whether or not his suspension would be eradicated.</p>
<p>What became the harsh reality for Tom and the rest of Patriot Nation was that Roger Goodell, the tyrant, set himself up with absolute, unbounded power when the CBA was put into place a few years back. Due to this stranglehold, Goodell was able to flip Brady&#8217;s case completely upside down and make it about his right to enforce his discipline regardless of a player&#8217;s innocence, or any other factor for that matter. Essentially, if Roger Goodell doesn&#8217;t like the way you cut your hair, he can suspend you for three games. If Goodell thinks you made fun of his hair piece behind closed doors, that&#8217;s four games.</p>
<p>This coming from a man who refused to acknowledge the facts (video evidence) that Ray Rice knocked his fiancee unconscious in an elevator. A man who has turned a blind eye to domestic violence, performance enhancing drugs, and several other infractions that have had a MUCH larger effect on the reputation and integrity of his game than an ALLEGEDLY deflated football used in a game that the Pats won by 38 points.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve said all along, the Brady suspension is a blessing in disguise for the Pats. Tom will have an extra four games of rest, and he will come back to a bevy of talented receivers DYING to catch passes from one of the best to ever lace them up. The extra rest will be huge for Brady and the Pats come playoff time. In addition, it will give the Pats a chance to showcase Jimmy Garappolo, who is nearing the end of his rookie deal and could be used as a trade chip moving forward with a solid performance in the first four weeks.</p>
<p>So enjoy the extended vacation with your super model wife and millions and millions of dollars, Tom. We&#8217;ll be ready for you to return week five and drop a 50 burger on those poor, poor Cleveland Browns. WE STAND WITH TOM.</p>

So as of right now, Brady&#8217;s four game suspension has been reinstated for the beginning of next season. But all of us know that Brady still isn&#8217;t going down without a fight&#8230;again.</p>
<p>Tom Brady and the Patriots have two options. He can appeal his case to the United States Supreme Court, where a higher court would reexamine the lower court&#8217;s decision on the case. Or he can accept the suspension and move on&#8230;yeah that&#8217;s not going to happen. The problem is, there is a very low chance that the US Supreme Court takes his case. But hey, we&#8217;ve seen Brady work miracles in the past so who knows what&#8217;s going to happen.</p>
<p>Brady&#8217;s legal team can also apply for a stay. This means that if the stay is accepted, Brady would be allowed to play the four games while the Supreme Court makes their decision or declines to accept his case. The issue with this is if Brady is granted a stay and ends up losing the case, he would have to serve his four game suspension most likely in the middle to end of the regular season, which would be worse. So Brady and his legal team have many factors to consider when making their decision.</p>
<p>Many people believe Brady is hurting his team or being selfish for what he is doing but he is doing what he believes is right. He believes that he is innocent and he will never admit to something he hasn&#8217;t done. I mean he may take this to the Supreme Court, this is some serious stuff. If Brady was guilty, do you really think he would go through all this trouble and stress just so he isn&#8217;t suspended four games? I mean come on, this whole thing is still unbelievable to me.</p>
<p>However it&#8217;s not over yet, once again there is still hope for Tom Brady and Patriots Nation. All we can hope for is justice to be served and for Brady to finally receive his innocence. This final step in the legal system really is going to be a Hail Mary for the Patriots.</p>
<p>Free Brady</p>

Tom Brady, the GOAT, was in attendance at the meeting to help Danny Ainge in the recruitment of Durant. Also David Ortiz would have been there to help but he was busy nuking baseballs into the stands at Fenway.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Kevin Durant needs to come to Boston. The Celts just signed All-Star Al Horford to a four year 113 million dollar deal, Isaiah Thomas is our point guard, Brad Stevens is the head coach, and the team is only improving. If Durant signs with Boston, they immediately become a contender for the NBA Finals. This new big three of Thomas, Horford, and Durant would be absurd. Three legitimate elite players on the same team would do some damage next season so it only makes sense for Kevin to play for the Celtics and he has to know that.</p>
<p>One thing I hope Kevin understands is just how praised he will be in Boston. Players in the NBA know that Boston fans are different. We&#8217;re the most passionate fans out there and we are always there supporting our team through the good and the ugly. Al Horford told his Dad that part of the reason he signed with the Celtics is because of the fans. He knows that when he steps foot on the hardwood in the Garden wearing that green jersey, everyone is going to go nuts for him. If Kevin Durant does the same, he will become loved beyond belief in Boston and I know that for a fact. And hey it&#8217;s Boston&#8230;who doesn&#8217;t love it here?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what was said in Durant&#8217;s meeting with the Celtics but I do know one thing. Ainge most definitely told Durant that if he comes to Boston, he will become a Celtic legend, just like he told Isaiah. So please Kevin, make the right and best decision of your life and play for the best basketball franchise ever.</p>
