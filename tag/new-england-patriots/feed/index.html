<p>It was part of an amazing call by Boston Bruins play-by-play announcer Dave Goucher in 2011, with the B&#8217;s clinching their first Stanley Cup in 39 years. The irony then, of today&#8217;s announcement of the firing of the head coach that lead them to that championship moment, Claude Julien, is apropos of a larger institutional issue with the franchise.</p>
<p>The symbology of yet another championship parade marching through the streets of Boston, with the aforementioned Duck Boats in service, while the Bruins deciding that of all days, smack-dab in the middle of the <strong>ACTUAL PARADE</strong>Â to fire Julien, is damning.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2017/02/07/black-and-gold-bruins-turn-yellow-on-parade-day/">Black and Gold Bruins Turn Yellow On Parade Day</a> (483 words)</p>

<p>Most people may not have known that Nate Ebner was a rugby player at heart. He never played high school football and played rugby at the Ohio State University. After years of rugby and the death of his Father, he decided to try out for the football team at Ohio State in hopes of achieving his dream to play in the NFL. He made the team and also was drafted by the Patriots after college at the 197th pick in the draft. Not only has Nate achieved his dream of playing in the NFL, he also is a Super Bowl Champion with the Patriots.</p>
<p>And even though the Men&#8217;s Rugby Team is eliminated from medal contention from their loss on Wednesday, Ebner has made all of us proud. He&#8217;s a go-getter and when he puts his mind to something, you better believe he&#8217;s going to do it. He said he was going to be an Olympian, and look at him now. His late Father would be proud of him.</p>
<p>Switching gears to women&#8217;s gymnastics, I&#8217;m sure everyone is aware of who Aly Raisman is how much of an impact she has on the Olympics. Aly and her &#8220;Final Five&#8221; squad got Gold in the Women&#8217;s Team Final Tuesday afternoon. The US beat second place Russia by 8.209 points, the largest margin of victory in olympic women&#8217;s gymnastics history. Aly Raisman served as a large impact in the team&#8217;s victory as she put on an absolute clinic during the floor exercise. Her final routine left me in awe. The moves she pulls off are truly extraordinary.</p>
<p>Raisman currently has three gold medals to her name. She will try to make that four gold metals when she attempts to go back to back golds in the individual floor competition.</p>
<p>Ebner and Raisman continue to impress all of us in what they do. Thank you for representing this great country and bring home more golds!</p>

Â They have had the best offseason of any team in the AFC if not in the league. Â However with as good as they are their are a few teams that could challenge them in the AFC.</p>
<p><strong>3. Houston Texans</strong></p>
<p>The Texans have had a sneaky good offseason. Â They signed two key free agents in Brock Osweiler, and Lamar Miller, they still have JJ Watt who we all know can be very dominant. Â Deandre Hopkins is coming off of a breakout season and he should only get better with the signing of Brock Osweiler. Â I have never taken the Texans serious, but if there is a team that could surprise people it&#8217;s them.</p>
<p><strong>2.Â IndianapolisÂ Colts</strong></p>
<p>At 8-8 last season The Colts totally underperformed, but this team still has super bowl potential. Â With The Colts it&#8217;s really just a question if they can stay healthy or not. Â However, with Andrew Luck this team has a chance to make some noise in the AFC, until they play The Pats.</p>
<p><strong>1.Pittsburgh Steelers</strong></p>
<p>The Steelers are clearly the second best team in the AFC, again they need to stay healthy. Â With Ben Roethlisberger, Antonio Brown, and Le&#8217;veon Bell, this offense will be very difficult to run with. Â Luckily, The Pats have a pretty good offense themselves. Â The Pats play at Pittsburgh this season, should be one of the best games of the year.</p>

Â The Celtics, Red Sox, and The Patriots all have had a pretty busy week.</p>
<p><strong>The Red Sox</strong></p>
<p>With the all-star break behind us it&#8217;s time for The Sox to focus on the second half of the season. Â The Red Sox started on the road against their arch rival Yankees who are having a terrible year. Â Stephen Wright got the ball in game 1 of the series and was well rested since he wasn&#8217;t allowed to pitch in the all-star game, (Which is another story in itself). Â The Yankees couldn&#8217;t touch Wright until the 6th inning, but with Boston bats hitting 3 Homeruns it was to much for The Yankees to handle. Â Game 2 of the series was all about Eduardo Rodriguez, he went 7 innings while only giving up 1 earned run. Â Oh, and Sandy Leon hit a 3 run homerun, what a find he has been for this team. Â It is important The Sox get all the wins they can now, the end of their season is a gauntlet with more than half of their games on the road.</p>
<p><strong>The Celtics</strong></p>
<p>Trade rumors have been all the talk in Boston. Â Blake Griffin? Russell Westbrook? Jahlil Okafor? Â Nobody really knows if The Celtics will make a deal, and who it will be for. Â As a Celtic fan you have to be excited, there&#8217;s hope around this team right now. Â If The Celtics are to land one of these players I think they&#8217;ll be seeing Cleveland in The Eastern Conference Finals.</p>
<p><strong>The Patriots</strong></p>
<p>Jimmy Garoppolo is the starting quarterback for The Patriots for the first four games of the season. Â There has been mixed feelings around if Brady made the right decision or not. Â However, taking the suspension now is the smart play, I&#8217;d rather have Brady missing the first four then the last four. Â This suspension will also be good for this teams future, either the league sees that Garoppolo can be a starter in this league and we trade him. Â Garoppolo plays really well and Belichick keeps him around to one day take over for Brady. Or worst case scenario, Garoppolo plays terrible and The Pats start off the season with a losing record. Â All and all I think The Pats will be just fine, and that a pissed off Brady coming back is bad for the NFL.</p>

So as of right now, Brady&#8217;s four game suspension has been reinstated for the beginning of next season. But all of us know that Brady still isn&#8217;t going down without a fight&#8230;again.</p>
<p>Tom Brady and the Patriots have two options. He can appeal his case to the United States Supreme Court, where a higher court would reexamine the lower court&#8217;s decision on the case. Or he can accept the suspension and move on&#8230;yeah that&#8217;s not going to happen. The problem is, there is a very low chance that the US Supreme Court takes his case. But hey, we&#8217;ve seen Brady work miracles in the past so who knows what&#8217;s going to happen.</p>
<p>Brady&#8217;s legal team can also apply for a stay. This means that if the stay is accepted, Brady would be allowed to play the four games while the Supreme Court makes their decision or declines to accept his case. The issue with this is if Brady is granted a stay and ends up losing the case, he would have to serve his four game suspensionÂ most likely in the middle to end of the regular season, which would be worse. So Brady and his legal team have many factors to consider when making their decision.</p>
<p>Many people believe Brady is hurting his team or being selfish for what he is doing but he is doing what he believes is right. He believes that he is innocent and he will never admit to something he hasn&#8217;t done. I mean he may take this to the Supreme Court, this is some serious stuff. If Brady was guilty, do you really think he would go through all this trouble and stress just so he isn&#8217;t suspended four games? I mean come on, this whole thing is still unbelievable to me.</p>
<p>However it&#8217;s not over yet, once again there is still hope for Tom Brady and Patriots Nation. All we can hope for is justice to be served and for Brady to finally receive his innocence. This final step in the legal system really is going to be a Hail Mary for the Patriots.</p>
<p>Free Brady</p>

<p>That being said, playoffs are never a given (unless your name is Tom Brady), and with that sentiment comes the inevitable questioning of offseason decisions. Time is the only way to tell whether or not the correct decision has been made, and as New England fans, we have been told to &#8220;trust in Belichick&#8221;. This is certainly an easy thing to do, as Belichick&#8217;s successes speak for themselves.</p>
<p>Belichick&#8217;s Patriots would not be the team to beat in the NFL if it were not for the team&#8217;s unquestioning work ethic and drive. Below are three players who have the most to prove this season on offense.</p>

It is now April 2016, over one year and three months since these allegations were introduced and we are <strong>STILL</strong>Â talking about this. Well thanks to Roger Goodell, Patriots fans have more reasons to despise him.</p>
<p>It seemed like we had the world in our hands going into the 2015-2016 season as Tom Brady was fresh out of a Deflategate court win. We had our starting quarterback for game one of the season, we were playing as the defending Super Bowl champions, and Brady&#8217;s revenge tour was engaged. We felt like nobody could stop our team. TheÂ Patriots had a fantastic season before coming up just shortÂ to the Denver Broncos in the AFC championship game.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2016/04/30/its-now-roger-goodell-vs-patriots-nation/">It&#8217;s Now Roger Goodell vs Patriots Nation</a> (580 words)</p>

The press conference started with statements and stories of gratitude and greatness in regards to the legendary 18-year veteran by Broncos President and CEO Joe Ellis, followed by Vice President of Denver football operations and legend in his own right John Elway, as well as current head coach Gary Kubiak. The speeches highlighted Manning&#8217;s greatness as a player in Indianapolis and Denver but also focused on his leadership, organization and community contribution, teamwork, and personal relationships he had with everyone involved with him in Denver. In a split screen on ESPN one could see the three aforementioned speakers giving examples of his illustriousness careerÂ in all capacities mentioned above with an emotional Peyton Manning doing his best to fight back tears.</p>
<p>When it was Peyton&#8217;s turn to speak he was as he usual is during interviews and media gatherings, all class. He had difficulty containing his emotions but did get through his speech which was full of career highlights and woes, stories of his first days on the NFL gridiron, and reflections on what specific moments in time meant to him both playing the game and interacting with players past and present in those moments.</p>
<p>Manning alluded to the Patriots on more than one occasion, the following is transcript from his speech:Â &#8220;Iâm going to miss a steak dinner at St. Elmo&#8217;s in Indianapolis after a win. My battles with players named Lynch, Lewis, Thomas, Bruschi, Fletcher, Dawkins, Seau, Urlacher, Polamalu, Harrison, Woodson and Reed. And with coaches like Fisher, Ryan, Belichick, Kiffin, Phillips, Rivera, LeBeau, Crennel, Capers, Lewis, the late Jim Johnson, and so many more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Iâll miss that handshake with Tom Brady and Iâll miss the plane rides after a big win with 53 teammates standing in the aisles, laughing and celebrating during the whole flight. Iâll miss playing in front of so many great fans both at home and on the road. Iâll even miss the Patriots fans in Foxborough, and they should miss me because they sure did get a lot of wins off of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a player Peyton Manning was always someone New England fans loved to hate, but now it is time to give Peyton his due, to honor his greatness, and to respect his legacy as one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever put on the uniform.</p>
<p>Bill Belichick was quoted as saying:Â &#8220;For 18 years, we battled fiercely but regardless of each game&#8217;s outcome, I always walked off the field with the utmost appreciation for the highest level of competition in which those games were prepared for and played. Peyton&#8217;s immense contributions to the game reflect how genuinely passionate he is about it. I can honestly say that I never &#8216;enjoyed&#8217; our meetings, but the respect I have for Peyton Manning as a competitor was, and will likely remain, second to none.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Brady on the Monday Morning Quarterback Show had this to say:Â âWhat just happened, winning the Super Bowl in his last game, is a perfect way to end a career. But what heâs accomplished through all these years, what makes it so admirable, is the pressure heâs had on him his whole life. He was the highest-rated recruit in high school. He was the biggest quarterback in college football. He was the first pick in the draft. Who has lived up to the expectations year after year after year as well as Peyton? Heâs done it so gracefully, so admirably. He set the standard for how to play the quarterback position.â</p>
<p>The drama provided over the years by the Brady vs Manning match ups has been unbelievable, for so many seasons these two quarterbacks were at the top of their game and their places in history will be forever intertwined. The level of preparation and surgically precise execution as well as competitive fire and Super Bowl contending teams made the contests some of the most well-played and exciting games of the era.</p>
<p>Peyton&#8217;s successÂ can be measured with his statistics and accolades which include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>-Most all-time passing yards: 71,940</p>
<p>-Most all-time passing touchdowns: 539</p>
<p>-Most all-time career wins (regular season and post season): 200</p>
<p>-Most all-time regular season wins: 186 (Tied with Brett Farve)</p>
<p>-Most all-time game-winning drives: 56</p>
<p>-Most all-time Pro Bowl Selections: 14</p>
<p>-Most all-time 4,000+ yard seasons: 14</p>
<p>-Most single season passing yards: 5,477</p>
<p>-Most single season touchdowns: 55</p>
<p>-Most NFL MVP awards: 5-time winner</p>
<p>And the thing that one would imagine Manning is most proud of (even if Eli isn&#8217;t psyched about it) is being a 2-time Super Bowl Champion.</p>
<p>Manning has countless other statistics that are impressive if not the best all-time but what fans can appreciate about Manning is that he was a student of the game and he respected the game as much as anyone who has ever played it.</p>
<p>As much as New England fans have hated Peyton Manning over the years, there is no match up that has been looked forward to more. The conversation of &#8216;who is the better quarterback&#8217; in regards to Brady and Manning has been had in about every sports bar in New England and probably many places around the country. Wherever fans land on this is their own perspective from their own experiences but one thing is for sure both of them could make a case for the best all-time. There has rarely been a television event that is more must-see TV than Brady vs Manning, Patriots vs Colts/Broncos over the last 15 seasons.</p>
<p>Manning finished his speech with this to say:Â &#8220;When I look back on my NFL career, Iâll know without a doubt that I gave everything I had to help my teams walk away with a win. There were other players who were more talented but there was no one could out-prepare me and because of that I have no regrets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thereâs a scripture reading, 2 Timothy 4:7: I have fought the good fight and I have finished the race. I have kept the faith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Iâve fought a good fight. Iâve finished my football race and after 18 years, itâs time. God bless all of you and God bless football.&#8221;</p>
<p>The final touch on the final day of his career was one of class, grace, and respect for the players, the fans, and the game of football.

The 11-time Pro Bowler was originally signed through 2017. Brady, 39 years of age this summer, was as sharp as ever this season and perhaps even better at avoiding the rush using pocket presence more than athletic ability. Tom took his fair share of hits with a porous offensive line (particular the physical beating in Denver) however has remained on the field consistently, playing in all 112 regular season games and 16 playoff games since 2008. Whether its the workouts or the kale smoothies, whatever he is doing is working to keep him healthy.</p>
<p>This season Brady completed 402 passes at a clip of 64.4% completion rate for 4,770 yards, 36 touchdowns and 7 picks, bottom line &#8211; he&#8217;s still got it. In fact, his numbers were actually slightly better this season than the previous three seasons across the board.</p>
<p>Not all the financial details have come out about what Brady will get paid the last two years of his deal but it is likely a restructuring that will allow the Patriots to resign key talents, particularly on the defensive side of the ball, keeping New England competitive going forward. Brady has done this in the past and has an incredible trust and bond with Bob Kraft and the organization.</p>
<p>This extension keeps the dynasty alive for four more years in New EnglandÂ with a fifth Super Bowl title in their sights. If Brady can stay healthy this would be a twenty year career in New England which may go down as the greatest all-time.</p>
