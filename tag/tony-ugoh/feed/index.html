				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In the fourth edition of a week long preview of the Colts vs. Pats (deemed El Clásico after a world famous European football rivalry between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid), I’ll take a look at the offensive and defensive lines for each team.</em></p>
<p><strong>Defensive Lines</strong><br />
<em>Patriots: Ty Warren, Vince Wilfork, Richard Seymour, Jarvis Green</em>: The defensive front three for the Patriots are the anchor of the 3-4 scheme which Bill Belichick has resurrected in the past seven seasons. The three presumed starters are all former first round picks and all play their position well. Warren came into his own in 2006 and Vince Wilfork &#8211; despite dropping 25 pounds in the off-season &#8211; is still a bohemith in the middle and usually takes up two offensive linemen. Richard Seymour missed the first seven weeks with a knee injury and played in limited snaps against the Redskins last week. If he can only play a small number of snaps, Jarvis Green proved his worth in Seymour&#8217;s absence and is a very able backup &#8211; leading the defensive line with three sacks on the year. The goal for the Pats D line is simple, clog the run to stop Joseph Addai from busting through the gut and get some sort of pressure on Manning. Whether it&#8217;s Seymour on the edge or simply taking up offensive line bodies to open up Vrabel and Colvin, the D line has to win the battle in the trenches to make life uncomfortable for Peyton &#8220;Cut That Meat&#8221; Manning.</p>
<p><em>Colts: Robert Mathis, Raheem Brock, Ed Johnson, Dwight Freeney</em>: The defensive line is the most improved part of the 2007 undefeated Colts. Mathis and Freeney can be terrors on the end, accounting for 5.5 sacks this season. The key player to watch of course in Freeney, who will be matched up against Matt Light. The interior defensive line will have trouble against a good set of Patriots guards and center Dan Koppen, but if Freeney and Mathis start getting pressure on Tom Brady we might see a lot more two TE sets from the Patriots, who like to use the three wide receiver, one TE set.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Both defensive lines must get push against solid offensive lines on the other side. Unlike the Colts however, the Patriots three (and sometimes just two) down lineman don&#8217;t need sacks and tackles to have a huge impact. With a far superior set of linebackers behind them, Warren, Wilfork and Seymour/Green just need to clog the gaps and take up bodies to let Bruschi, Vrabel and Co. do their work. Rookie LT Tony Ugoh has been impressive this year, but the Colts haven&#8217;t faced a defense nearly this quick. I see Warren coming up with a big play and Wilfork having a massive (no pun intended) impact in the middle. I see both LT Matt Light and RT Nick Kazur being able to limit the damage from Freeney and Mathis. <strong>Edge: Patriots</strong><br />
