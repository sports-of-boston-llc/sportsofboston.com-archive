Wisnia charts the entire history of the Red Sox, their team owners, their fans and their ballpark. The narrative simultaneously moves at a pace brisk enough to keep the reader from ever feeling bogged down and provides enough new information that even seasoned Red Sox historians can learn something new from it.</p>
<p>Wisnia also does a top-notch job balancing text with pictures that just as effectively show the changes to the team and especially Fenway Park itself over the years.</p>
<h2>DVD Adds Nothing</h2>
<p>At $29.99, it doesn&#8217;t seem as if the DVD, &#8220;Fenway Park: the Golden Age,&#8221; adds much to the cost. Which is good, because it adds nothing to the content. Narrated by Carlton Fisk, the hour-long documentary – oddly named, since it covers the entire Boston history – is as clunky and content-light as the book is smooth and content-balanced. Hearing Fisk and former broadcaster Curt Gowdy is neat, but all of the information (and most of the photos) are available in the book. The documentary also uses black-and-white footage for every game before the 1980s and the washed-out colors and simple graphics of 1980s T.V. for all subsequent games (including the 2004 and 2007 postseasons). The result is a sense of faux-nostalgia instead of anything real.</p>
<h2>Quality Start to Book, but Wisnia Can&#8217;t Close it Out</h2>
<p>The most informative chapters of the book are at the beginning. Few Red Sox fans have much of a connection with the 1903 Red Sox team – which won the first ever World Series – beyond a few names culled from the lyrics of the Dropkick Murphys&#8217; &#8220;Tessie.&#8221; Wisnia goes in-depth into who exactly Michael &#8220;Nuf Ced&#8221; McGreevey and his Royal Rooters were. His explanation begins a pattern of starting each of the nine chapters (and the prologue) with a story about a Red Sox fan at the time. Considering how passionately Red Sox fans care about Fenway – whose origins and renovations Wisnia clearly lays out – it makes perfect sense to always start with them.</p>
