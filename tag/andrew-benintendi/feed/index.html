After a dismal road-trip, the Red Sox failed to improve on their record in a series against the Yankees, and now sit at only nine games above .500.</p>
<p>The playoff picture in the East is tight as it will ever be, with the Sox three games behind the Jays, and 2.5 behind the Orioles. At the moment, the Red Sox hold a .5 game lead over the Tigers for the second spot in the race for the second wild card berth. A poor series against a .500 team was the last thing David Ortiz and Co. needed, but regardless, it is what they got.</p>
<p>With a team as streaky as this, it&#8217;s feasible to consider the possibility that they might go on another tear, and finish the season with breathing room in any playoff race. However, sports in the Boston media remain ever-reactionary, and the flavor of the past ten games has been doom. It is always difficult to remain positive, after the stretch the Sox have most recently suffered through.</p>
<p>One of the bright spots on the team has been newcomer Andrew Benintendi. Unfortunately, the key word in the sentence prior is &#8220;newcomer&#8221;. All rookies are bound to make mistakes, or have a &#8220;welcome to the League&#8221; moment. Benintendi&#8217;s simply came during a crucial moment in the game.</p>
<p>For those watching, it was next to unbelievable. A seemingly playable, albeit sharply, hit ball by Jacoby Ellsbury quickly made it&#8217;s way into left field, prompting a quick response by Benintendi. The ball went mere centimeters over the 22 year old, and Ellsbury was safely aboard with a double, driving in two. Those two runs proved insurmountable in the eighth and the ninth for the Sox, who once again left the field with a heartbreaking loss.</p>
<p>Heartbreaking losses are acceptable in a season of 162 games, but at the rate they are coming lately to this team, one has to wonder if this is truly a team built for postseason success. All outside factors point to yes, with phenoms X, Betts, JBJ, and now Benintendi-but close games, especially during the postseason-are must-wins.</p>

The Sox acquired left handed reliever Fernando Abad from the Minnesota Twins in exchange for minor league lefty Pat Light.</p>
<p>Abad will help the Sox&#8217;s struggling bullpen as left handed hitters have only a .163 batting average off him this season. This is not a big trade but will definitely aid the Sox a little with their pitching situation. But the move that everyone was hoping for was to see another stud pitcher in the starting rotation.</p>
<p>Everyone knows Chris Sale was the talk of the deadline but it was no surprise to me that he stayed with Chicago. A dominant pitcher like him is not going to go anywhere without a very large trade being put in place. It&#8217;s a shame the Sox couldn&#8217;t snag him because he is just what we are missing.</p>
<p>However, I have to say I am very surprised Andrew Benintendi and Joan Moncada stayed with the AA Portland Sea Dogs. I expected the Sox to move at least one of them in a trade to acquire a starting pitcher. Now that they are staying in the Sox farm system, I don&#8217;t know what the Sox are going to do with their starting rotation.</p>
<p>The addition of Drew Pomeranz was viewed as a good move at first but is looking a little shaky right now. Steven Wright has had a couple bad starts lately and David Price is still yet to get into a consistent groove. The only consistent pitcher the Sox have right now is Rick Porcello who quietly has been a stud this year with a 14-2 record.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what the Sox are going to do but if they want to be serious contenders for the playoffs, their pitching has to make some adjustments. The AL East and the American League in general is very competitive right now and it&#8217;s really a toss up for which teams are going to win the division and the wild card.</p>
<p>Safe to say this trade deadline helped, but it wasn&#8217;t enough.</p>

Benintendi, a product of the Arkansas Razorback&#8217;s baseball team, was batting .341 in the Carolina League, and was a major factor in his team&#8217;s successes. One of the most intriguing stat lines this outfielder can claim includes 135 ABs-and only nine strikeouts.</p>
<p>Benintendi ranks as the number three prospect in the Red Sox&#8217;s farm system (#22 overall), and is rising quickly. The 21 year-old also led the Carolina league in several offensive categories, including hits (46), extra base hits (21), and triples (7). Benintendi strung together a 23 game hit-streak early this season, and was always a candidate to be promoted early and often. His swing is pretty to watch, and he has power despite a smaller frame (5&#8242; 10&#8243;, 170).</p>
<p>In two games so far in his new home in Portland, Benintendi has gone 2-7, and has driven in two runs. The move from Single-A to Double-A is never a simple one, and time will be the only judge of whether or not the Red Sox were too quick to advance this electrifying outfielder.</p>
