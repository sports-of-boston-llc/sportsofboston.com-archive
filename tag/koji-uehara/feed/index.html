Last night (or early this morning) the Red Sox acquired 36 year old righty Brad Ziegler from Arizona for prospects Jose Almonte and Luis Alejandro Basabe. Ziegler will immediately help to stabilize a bullpen that has been teetering on the brink of implosion for months. Koji Uehara, while certainly effective at various times throughout the year, has been something of a &#8220;choose your own adventure&#8221; on the bump this season. You never know if you&#8217;re getting the dominant Koji we remember from 2013 who helped lead the Sox to a World Series title, or if you&#8217;re getting the guy we saw last night, giving up monster yabos to a less-than-stellar Rays lineup and nearly blowing a game that the Sox seemed to have in the bag. Junichi Tazawa, who has been an extremely valuable bullpen piece for the Sox over the past several seasons, has completely fallen off the rails this year. His ERA has ballooned since a solid start to the season, and he simply can no longer be relied upon in high leverage situations. Add in the fact that Carson Smith was lost earlier this year to Tommy John, and you begin to see why this move was imminent.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Ziegler will help to spell Sox closer Craig Kimbrel, who has been dealing with some knee soreness in recent weeks. While Kimbrel certainly hasn&#8217;t been the dominant closer we all expected coming over from Atlanta in the offseason, he&#8217;s still the best relief pitcher on this staff by a wide margin. Dave Dombrowski didn&#8217;t bring Brad Ziegler in to take Craig Kimbrel&#8217;s job. The move is more of an &#8220;insurance policy&#8221; of sorts. Ziegler does an excellent job of pitching to contact, and he is a veteran reliever who is comfortable pitching in almost any situation. One of the biggest knocks on Kimbrel this year has been his inability to perform in non-save situations. Ziegler should help to remedy that issue, in addition to taking over the eighth inning role for Koji.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">What really gets me excited about the Sox recent acquisitions is the idea that Red Sox front office is gearing up for bigger, better moves as the trade deadline draws closer. Getting a guy like Aaron Hill, who has been a terrific hitter at Fenway throughout his career (.308) to play third against lefties and give Pedroia the occasional day off at second was the first of what feels like many moves on the horizon for Dave Dombrowski and the Sox. Then Ziegler today, instantly fills another void.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">In order to make the &#8220;big splashes&#8221; on the trade market, a savvy GM  first must take care of the leaks and crevices. Getting a big name pitcher the likes of Jose Fernandez of Chris Sale is of no value to the Sox if their bullpen is just going to give up the lead in the 7th or 8th. It&#8217;s now clear that the Sox are in it for the long haul, and that Dave Dombrowski has a few more tricks up his sleeve before the August 1st deadline.</p>

Rather, it really is worth asking when the Red Sox are going to finally part with John Farrell as their manager and allow Torey Lovullo to take over. It is a question of when, not if, because Farrell is clearly on his last legs as manager. In fact, the Red Sox likely would have relieved Farrell of his duties in the offseason were it not for some extenuating circumstances with his health. Lovullo had several chances to interview for managerial roles in the offseason, but he stayed as bench coach because the Red Sox convinced him that he was next in line to take over the dugout. But regardless of who the replacement is, it is time for Farrell to go; he is clearly in over his head and the Red Sox need leadership from a manager who can win.</p>
<p>It really has been stunning how Farrell&#8217;s in-game managing has fallen off of a cliff in 2016. Not that he was a very good in-game manager in the first place, but there have been multiple occasions in 2016 where Farrell has left literally everyone in the ballpark wondering what he is thinking.</p>

There is no question that Kimbrel immediately stabilized what was one of the worst relief corps in the Majors last season, but <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2015/12/redsox-trade-wade-miley-mariners.html">another trade for a reliever</a> could be just as important for the Red Sox. Sending <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8779&amp;position=P">Wade Miley</a> and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=14699&amp;position=P">Jonathan Aro</a> to Seattle for <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=13172&amp;position=P">Carson Smith</a> and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=12673&amp;position=P">Roenis Elias</a> will likely be almost as beneficial to the Red Sox bullpen as acquiring Kimbrel in an effort to shorten games.</p>
<p>It might have been easy to miss Smith’s brilliance on the West Coast last season, but he dominated from wire to wire and ended up closing games for the Mariners. He only ended up saving 13 games, but every other statistic was outstanding for Smith: strikeout rate (11.83 K/9), walk rate (2.83 BB/9), homerun rate (0.26 HR/9), average against (.192), ground ball rate (64.8%), ERA (2.31), FIP (2.12), and xFIP (2.36). All of this success occurred without a blazing fastball (90.5 average fastball, 92.5 average sinker), which lessens his reliance on the strikeout to be effective. Further, those numbers were achieved without any help in luck-based stats like BABIP allowed (.292) or strand rate (78.5%). This suggests that Smith’s outstanding performance in 2015 is repeatable, and that he can be a versatile setup ace in front of Kimbrel and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=9227&amp;position=P">Koji Uehara</a>.</p>

Boston&#8217;s latest action came in the form of a trade with the Seattle Mariners. The Sox traded lefty starter Wade Miley and Jonathan Aro for reliever Carson Smith and Roenis Elias.</p>
<p>Miley was a fiery competitor who occasionally bumped heads with Red Sox manager John Farrell last season in his first and only season in Boston. The left hander was a solid middle of the rotation starter for Boston going 11-11 with a 4.46 ERA and leading the team in innings pitched with 193 plus in 32 starts. The quality that Boston may miss most about Miley is his durability. He is able to go out and pitch every fifth day for which the same cannot be said for the injury-prone Clay Buchholz and Joe Kelly who are likely to sandwich Rick Porcello with the third and fifth starter spots to open to season. The reason for moving Miley is the need for an upgrade in the bullpen and financially his contract is very reasonable for the Mariners to manage. It is also known that Dombrowski wasn&#8217;t willing to deal the young, hard-throwing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez who pitched well for Boston in his first season in the majors going 10-6 with a 3.85 ERA. It also always seems like Red Sox fans and management alike start every season with the same sentence about Clay Buchholz, &#8220;If he can just stay healthy&#8230;&#8221; which he inevitably does not. However whether the Red Sox are unwilling to let go of the potential 1/3 of a season ace or other teams have lost interest in watching him get scratched night after night Buchholz is staying put in Boston, at least for now. As for the possibility of dealing Porcello, Boston pretty much hitched their wagon to him with a 4-year $82.5 million dollar contract last season and with the way he pitched no one is chomping at the bit there.</p>
<p>Now what did the Red Sox get in return? A 26-year old, right handed, side arm delivery reliever in Carson Smith. The young Smith is considered to have a power arm, hurling a fastball in the 93-95 MPH range with a killer, swing-and-miss slider, especially for righties, and the ability to mix in a changeup. In 70 innings pitched last season with Seattle he was able to produce 92 strikeouts, this exemplifies the kind of stuff he is bringing to the Red Sox bullpen. Smith went 2-5 with 22 holds, 13 saves and a 2.31 ERA in 2015. His roll in the much improved Boston bullpen will likely be a seventh inning set up man with Koji Uehara pitching the eighth and Craig Kimbrel now taking over as the closer. This kind of late inning fire power has been a successful model in recent years. The Royals had great success all season and will be handing out World Series rings with much thanks to their bullpen, the Yankees have also developed a one-two knockout punch in Dellin Betances and Andrew Miller coming out of the pen to finish games.</p>
<p>Sox manager John Farrell had this to say regarding the now weaponized Sox bullpen: &#8220;What&#8217;s clearly different with this group is that it&#8217;s deeper in talent, it&#8217;s deeper in performance, it&#8217;s deeper in the ability to get strikeouts in key spots. We&#8217;ve got the ability to now assign innings to individual guys where they can probably mentally prepare for that inning.&#8221;</p>
<p>An included advantage in the revamped bullpen is depth and flexibility. Smith has been a set up man and closer in the past and could be up to the task if Uehara needed a night off. Uehara has been the Sox closer for the past few seasons if rest for Kimbrel is necessary. Lets also not forget about the hard-throwing Junichi Tazawa who can rotate in for back end relief. It appears a weakness of lasts year&#8217;s Red Sox team may have been turned into a strength in just a few short months this off season.</p>
<p>Boston also acquired Cuban-born, 27-year old Roenis Elias who went 5-8 with a 4.14 ERA in 20 starts last season. The lefty also had two relief appearances. It is unclear at this time what Boston will do with him, it is thought that he could add depth to the starting rotation or compete for a spot in the bullpen. Elias&#8217; ability to get a starting spot may hinge on whether the Red Sox go hard after another starter such as veteran Cliff Lee who stated he plans to pitch in 2016.</p>
<p>Dombrowski and the Red Sox have aggressively taken care of business early and put themselves in great position to sit back and listen to possible trades and opportunities as baseball&#8217;s winter meetings continue in Nashville Tennessee.</p>

One example involves the Red Sox and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8001&amp;position=SS">Hanley Ramirez</a>. About halfway through the 2015 season it became apparent that Hanley was/is not interested in making himself better, and is generally not worth a major league roster spot. Many fans (myself included) are hoping to find a Hanley trade under the tree this holiday season, which is why it was so exciting to see the reports that Dave Bombrowski is <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2015/11/red-sox-shopping-hanley-ramirez.html">actively shopping Hanley</a> to other teams around the league.</p>
<p>Unfortunately trading Hanley is much easier said than done; his attitude and salary make it more difficult to find a willing taker. The Red Sox will likely need to decide between straight dumping Hanley for the sake of getting rid of him, and including more cash and/or players to get something decent in return. It seems like including more money to offset his salary is the smart play here, but it remains to be seen if a trade partner would be willing to give up anything of value for Hanley. The report above cites the Seattle Mariners, Baltimore Orioles, and Los Angeles Angels as speculative fits at the moment, so lets take a quick look at what a deal could look like with any of those clubs (disclaimer: Hanley is <a href="https://www.baseballprospectus.com/compensation/cots/al-east/boston-red-sox/">still owed $66 million</a> over the next three seasons, plus a vesting option for the 2019 season).</p>

Kimbrel immediately becomes the closer for the Red Sox since he has been one of the most dominant relievers in the history of the game, and provides an enormous upgrade from what the Red Sox had at the back of the bullpen in 2015. In fact, Kimbrel would be an upgrade over just about any closer in the game, so Dombrowski got good value in this trade, even though most people think he gave up too much prospect value. We don’t want to get too into that argument yet, but we can analyze how Kimbrel can improve the Red Sox bullpen aside from a flamethrower-fastball and a wipeout breaking ball. Following is our list of current Red Sox relievers who stand to gain from Kimbrel’s addition to the bullpen, and how they might benefit.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=9227&amp;position=P">Koji Uehara</a>:</p>
<p>Kimbrel’s acquisition comes with an automatic demotion for Uehara, who has been brilliant for just about his entire Red Sox career, including their World Series run in 2013. But his “demotion” only comes through the fact that Kimbrel is the best closer in the game, not by any fault of his own. Uehara maintained great strikeout (10.49 K/9) and walk (2.01 BB/9) rates into the latest stage of his career, even as his velocity has started to disappear (87.0 average fastball velocity in 2015). If he can manage to sustain his effectiveness even somewhere close to his current level, he will turn out to be an invaluable setup man for the eighth inning, and can combine with Kimbrel to shorten a game to seven innings.</p>

In fact, the lineup went above and beyond the call of duty, erasing a 7-0 deficit to tie the game at 8 in the bottom of the ninth inning. Ultimately, asking the bullpen to hold Seattle scoreless into extras proved to be too tall a task, to virtually no one’s surprise. Here are several notes and observations from Sunday’s game:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=13143&amp;position=P">Henry Owens</a> was a complete enigma on Sunday. Owens gave up 7 runs over his first three innings of work, mostly on the strength of three home runs (one from <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=3269&amp;position=2B">Robinson Cano</a>, two from <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=3255&amp;position=OF">Franklin Gutierrez</a>). However, he was able to settle into the ballgame and ended up getting through six innings, allowing ten hits with the seven earned runs. It was a good sign that Owens was resilient enough to last moderately deep into the game and save his bullpen to some extent. Owens’s peripherals were very strong against Seattle, striking out ten batters in his six innings while only walking one Mariner. Home run luck fluctuates throughout the course of a season, so if Owens can keep his K/BB rate in a similar range as it was in Sunday’s contest, he will have much more success over the rest of the season. In summary, the initial stat line looks subpar, but Owens pitched better than it seems.</li>

<p>While flexibility is a great tool for any team, opportunities exist for Boston to deal All-Star utility player Brock Holt to a contending team. Holt can fit on any roster, and with the Royals taking Ben Zobrist off the market, the only similar trade option is Martin Prado. The Sox could attempt to capitalize on this unique market by exchanging the 27-year-old for a low-level prospect, which may be a better move long term.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/07/29/small-deals-can-make-a-big-impact-on-the-red-sox/">Small Deals Can Make a Big Impact on the Red Sox</a> (450 words)</p>
