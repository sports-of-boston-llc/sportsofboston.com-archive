<p>Instead of Clay Buchholz returning from his relegation to the bullpen, John Farrell announced on Wednesday that Roenis Elias will greet the Mariners, his former team, for the opener of a three game series tonight at Fenway Park. Farrell attributed his choice of Elias, at least in part, to the potent left-handed sluggers in the Mariners lineup, most notably Robinson Cano and Kyle Seager.</p>
<p>Elias, 27, was acquired last off season in the trade that sent Wade Miley and Jonathan Aro to the Mariners in exchange for Elias and Carson Smith. At the time the deal looked like a steal for the Red Sox, but with Elias in Pawtucket and Smith having undergone Tommy John, Miley sounds pretty good as an inning eater in the back of the rotation. Instead it is time for Elias to step up.</p>
<p>Elias successfully made the harrowing voyage from Cuba to the U.S. in 2010, and in the following year began his career playing in rookie league for the Seattle Mariners before working his way up the minor league ranks to Double-A by the end of 2013. The next year Elias made the big league roster out of spring training as the Mariners fourth starter. That season he pitched to the tune of a 3.85 ERA in twenty nine starts before the Mariners shut him down in mid-September with an elbow strain. In 2015, Elias bounced between Seattle and their Triple-A affiliate, Tacoma, posting a 4.14 ERA in twenty two appearances for the big league team.</p>
<p>In a recent interview Dave Dombrowski noted that out of spring training they wanted Elias to find one consistent release point for his curveball. Instead of employing a breaking ball from three or four different arms spots, the Red Sox asked him to find the best one and throw it on a consistent basis in an attempt to refine his command.</p>
<p>This season on the east coast is a change for scenery for Elias,and he has pitched well for Pawtucket. In ten games, nine starts, he has a 3.54 ERA and 8.85 K/9, and in his last five starts he has been particularly sharp. He has focused on finding a consistent breaking ball this season with the PawSox and will need to use this pitch effectively tonight if he wants to keep the potent Mariners offense off balance.</p>
<p>Roenis Elias is presented with a great chance to prove himself tonight at Fenway and, given the state of the Red Sox rotation right now, can earn himself another start if he pitches well. The Red Sox pitching staff is club&#8217;s biggest weakness right now, and an emergence from this Cuban south paw would help the team immensely as Dombrowski tries to patch together a reliable rotation before the August 1st trade deadline.</p>

There is no question that Kimbrel immediately stabilized what was one of the worst relief corps in the Majors last season, but <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2015/12/redsox-trade-wade-miley-mariners.html">another trade for a reliever</a> could be just as important for the Red Sox. Sending <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8779&amp;position=P">Wade Miley</a> and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=14699&amp;position=P">Jonathan Aro</a> to Seattle for <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=13172&amp;position=P">Carson Smith</a> and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=12673&amp;position=P">Roenis Elias</a> will likely be almost as beneficial to the Red Sox bullpen as acquiring Kimbrel in an effort to shorten games.</p>
<p>It might have been easy to miss Smith’s brilliance on the West Coast last season, but he dominated from wire to wire and ended up closing games for the Mariners. He only ended up saving 13 games, but every other statistic was outstanding for Smith: strikeout rate (11.83 K/9), walk rate (2.83 BB/9), homerun rate (0.26 HR/9), average against (.192), ground ball rate (64.8%), ERA (2.31), FIP (2.12), and xFIP (2.36). All of this success occurred without a blazing fastball (90.5 average fastball, 92.5 average sinker), which lessens his reliance on the strikeout to be effective. Further, those numbers were achieved without any help in luck-based stats like BABIP allowed (.292) or strand rate (78.5%). This suggests that Smith’s outstanding performance in 2015 is repeatable, and that he can be a versatile setup ace in front of Kimbrel and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=9227&amp;position=P">Koji Uehara</a>.</p>

Boston&#8217;s latest action came in the form of a trade with the Seattle Mariners. The Sox traded lefty starter Wade Miley and Jonathan Aro for reliever Carson Smith and Roenis Elias.</p>
<p>Miley was a fiery competitor who occasionally bumped heads with Red Sox manager John Farrell last season in his first and only season in Boston. The left hander was a solid middle of the rotation starter for Boston going 11-11 with a 4.46 ERA and leading the team in innings pitched with 193 plus in 32 starts. The quality that Boston may miss most about Miley is his durability. He is able to go out and pitch every fifth day for which the same cannot be said for the injury-prone Clay Buchholz and Joe Kelly who are likely to sandwich Rick Porcello with the third and fifth starter spots to open to season. The reason for moving Miley is the need for an upgrade in the bullpen and financially his contract is very reasonable for the Mariners to manage. It is also known that Dombrowski wasn&#8217;t willing to deal the young, hard-throwing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez who pitched well for Boston in his first season in the majors going 10-6 with a 3.85 ERA. It also always seems like Red Sox fans and management alike start every season with the same sentence about Clay Buchholz, &#8220;If he can just stay healthy&#8230;&#8221; which he inevitably does not. However whether the Red Sox are unwilling to let go of the potential 1/3 of a season ace or other teams have lost interest in watching him get scratched night after night Buchholz is staying put in Boston, at least for now. As for the possibility of dealing Porcello, Boston pretty much hitched their wagon to him with a 4-year $82.5 million dollar contract last season and with the way he pitched no one is chomping at the bit there.</p>
<p>Now what did the Red Sox get in return? A 26-year old, right handed, side arm delivery reliever in Carson Smith. The young Smith is considered to have a power arm, hurling a fastball in the 93-95 MPH range with a killer, swing-and-miss slider, especially for righties, and the ability to mix in a changeup. In 70 innings pitched last season with Seattle he was able to produce 92 strikeouts, this exemplifies the kind of stuff he is bringing to the Red Sox bullpen. Smith went 2-5 with 22 holds, 13 saves and a 2.31 ERA in 2015. His roll in the much improved Boston bullpen will likely be a seventh inning set up man with Koji Uehara pitching the eighth and Craig Kimbrel now taking over as the closer. This kind of late inning fire power has been a successful model in recent years. The Royals had great success all season and will be handing out World Series rings with much thanks to their bullpen, the Yankees have also developed a one-two knockout punch in Dellin Betances and Andrew Miller coming out of the pen to finish games.</p>
<p>Sox manager John Farrell had this to say regarding the now weaponized Sox bullpen: &#8220;What&#8217;s clearly different with this group is that it&#8217;s deeper in talent, it&#8217;s deeper in performance, it&#8217;s deeper in the ability to get strikeouts in key spots. We&#8217;ve got the ability to now assign innings to individual guys where they can probably mentally prepare for that inning.&#8221;</p>
<p>An included advantage in the revamped bullpen is depth and flexibility. Smith has been a set up man and closer in the past and could be up to the task if Uehara needed a night off. Uehara has been the Sox closer for the past few seasons if rest for Kimbrel is necessary. Lets also not forget about the hard-throwing Junichi Tazawa who can rotate in for back end relief. It appears a weakness of lasts year&#8217;s Red Sox team may have been turned into a strength in just a few short months this off season.</p>
<p>Boston also acquired Cuban-born, 27-year old Roenis Elias who went 5-8 with a 4.14 ERA in 20 starts last season. The lefty also had two relief appearances. It is unclear at this time what Boston will do with him, it is thought that he could add depth to the starting rotation or compete for a spot in the bullpen. Elias&#8217; ability to get a starting spot may hinge on whether the Red Sox go hard after another starter such as veteran Cliff Lee who stated he plans to pitch in 2016.</p>
<p>Dombrowski and the Red Sox have aggressively taken care of business early and put themselves in great position to sit back and listen to possible trades and opportunities as baseball&#8217;s winter meetings continue in Nashville Tennessee.</p>

Red Sox hitters held up their end of that arrangement in scoring eight runs in the contest, but surprisingly <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2015_09_26_balmlb_bosmlb_1#game=2015_09_26_balmlb_bosmlb_1,game_tab=box,game_state=Wrapup">seven Red Sox relievers combined to shut out</a> the O’s for the second straight contest. Call it the shock of the century. The bullpen has been the worst part of the 2015 Red Sox, yet still managed to shut out a lineup that included <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=11493&amp;position=3B">Manny Machado</a>, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=9272&amp;position=1B">Chris Davis</a>, and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=4298&amp;position=C">Matt Wieters</a>.</p>
<p>This is a bullpen that <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=rel&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=0&amp;type=8&amp;season=2015&amp;month=0&amp;season1=2015&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0,ts&amp;rost=0&amp;age=0&amp;filter=&amp;players=0">ranks among the worst in all of baseball</a>:</p>
<p>26<sup>th</sup> in K/9: 7.76</p>
<p>16<sup>th</sup> in BB/9: 3.28</p>
<p>28<sup>th</sup> in Groundball rate: 41.6%</p>
<p>27<sup>th</sup> in Average Against: .262</p>
<p>26<sup>th</sup> in ERA: 4.35</p>
<p>30<sup>th</sup> (dead last) in FIP: 4.59</p>
<p>28<sup>th</sup> in xFIP: 4.33</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Against an offense that ranks <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=bat&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=0&amp;type=8&amp;season=2015&amp;month=0&amp;season1=2015&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0,ts&amp;rost=0&amp;age=0&amp;filter=&amp;players=0">among the most powerful in the game</a>:</p>

<p>9<sup>th</sup> in RBI: 648</p>
<p>6<sup>th</sup> in Slugging: .418</p>
<p>4<sup>th</sup> in Isolated Power: .168</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also notable that veteran <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=4363&amp;position=P">Craig Breslow</a> made his first career start after 522 career relief appearances, and also set a new career high with four Innings Pitched. <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=11632&amp;position=P">Heath Hembree</a>, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=12863&amp;position=P">Matt Barnes</a>, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=10261&amp;position=P">Alexi Ogando</a>, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=7501&amp;position=P">Tommy Layne</a>, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=12800&amp;position=P">Noe Ramirez</a>, and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=14699&amp;position=P">Jonathan Aro</a> covered the remaining five innings, allowing only three hits and three walks to Orioles sluggers. We cannot stress enough how unusual this combined performance was, considering the struggles Red Sox relievers have endured all season long. This is not to suggest that yesterday’s game stands as a huge turning point in the bullpen’s season, only that they came together when needed most and delivered as solid a performance as could be expected, all while their most effective reliever (<a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=9227&amp;position=P">Koji Uehara</a>) was completely unavailable. In a season that has been dominated by failure and underperformance, this was a fun, refreshing way to be pleasantly surprised.</p>
