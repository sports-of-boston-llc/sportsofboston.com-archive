				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Red Sox got the long 10-game road trip started with a visit to the Tigers for four games.  The series featured very good starting pitching for the Red Sox in three of the games, which was the key to the series.  As the Sox starters were able to stifle the Detroit lineup, it allowed the bullpen to stay fresh and Terry Francona to use them in their customary roles to lock down victories.  <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=28631">Daisuke Matsuzaka</a> allowed 10 baserunners, but only one run in the Game 1 start.  <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=6454">Craig Hansen</a> looked a bit shaky, but <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=6454">Hideki Okajima</a> and <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=6373">Jonathan Papelbon</a> finished it.</p>
<p>The second game featured a two-hit gem from <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=2748">Tim Wakefield</a>, wrapped up by <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=2464">Mike Timlin</a>, for the combined shutout.  The Tigers battered <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=28855">Clay Buchholz</a> and <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=2945">Julian Tavarez</a> in the third installment, but the Red Sox battled back to take a 9-8 eight inning lead, before yielding the victory on a Papelbon blown save.  <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=4242">Josh Beckett</a> demonstrated that he is the stopper and held the Tigers to a single run over seven innings, leading the Red Sox to a three to one series edge.</p>

<p>A man told the NY Daily News that he has a photo of Roger Clemens with other MLB players at Jose Canseco&#8217;s infamous party in 1998. The man, then 11, took the picture and has held on to it for more than 9 years. Who would blame him? It&#8217;s Roger Clemens.</p>
<p>If the photo exists and is real, it is extremely damaging to Clemens&#8217; testimony. Clemens and Jose Canseco, among numerous others, claimed the Rocket was not at Canseco&#8217;s house party in 1998. Brian McNamee insisted that Clemens was there, and he saw him talking to Canseco.</p>
<p>McNamee claimed that was the first time he ever heard Clemens ask him about steroids. McNamee presumed it was from his conversations with Canseco, who was a known steroid user. Part of the Mitchell Report refers to this party, based on the testimony from McNamee.</p>
<p>Said McNamee&#8217;s lawyer, Richard Emery:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We have reason to believe it&#8217;s reliable evidence. We believe there&#8217;s photographic evidence that shows Clemens was at a party he says he wasn&#8217;t at.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>More on this story as it develops&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brian McNamee&#8217;s lawyer may have overstepped his bounds when he alleged that President George W. Bush could pardon Roger Clemens should The Rocket be indicted.</p>
<p>Richard Emery, McNamee&#8217;s lawyer, said that Republicans at the Congressional hearing were more harsh on McNamee than Clemens because Clemens is a friend of the Bush family.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It would be the easiest thing in the world for George W. Bush, given the corrupt proclivities of his administration, to say Roger Clemens is an American hero, Roger Clemens helped children. It&#8217;s my belief they have some reason to believe they can get a pardon.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Rusty Hardin, Clemens&#8217; lawyer, fired back at Emery for the crazy accusation. He probably overstepped his bounds with this comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Richard Emery just has to quit smoking his own dope.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This situation is <strong>far</strong> from over.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="justify">The plan was good and it almost worked&#8230;until Roger opened his mouth. On a day where everything could have worked perfectly, Roger Clemens simply crashed and burned.</p>
<p align="justify">Let me set the record straight: after watching the whole process before the Congress, I&#8217;m convinced: Clemens is a liar. Bad, that was too bad to see one of the greatest pitchers of all the time (the greatest?) crash and burn. And the irony? Clemens asked for it. He was the first to ask for interviews and tribunes to explain himself, eager to deny every allegation that could tarnish his legacy. That legacy, was tarnished, yesterday, not by McNamee or Pettitte, but by Clemens himself. Clemens made, probably, the wrongest calculation of all time when he decided to ignore the fact that he <strong>might</strong> not be the same pitcher as he used to be.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For as long as I can remember watching Red Sox baseball, I only had room in my heart for one player.  Whenever a player leaves the Sox, I usually switch my spotlight to another. In the past, this spot has been held by former outfielder Trot Nixon and looks to be soon taken over by the man who got me a free taco, Jacoby Ellsbury. When once asked if I could meet one celebrity and why, I answered Roger Clemens because of the way he performed on the field and the way he carried himself off the field.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By denying and totally refuting anything that Brian McNamee has said, Roger Clemens is challenging the very foundation of the Mitchell Report. McNamee provided a lot of information that became public from the Mitchell Report, including testimony about Roger Clemens, Chuck Knoblauch, and Andy Pettitte.</p>
<p>If McNamee is lying then the Mitchell Report loses a lot of credibility. If the Mitchell Report loses credibility, so does Major League Baseball. I hope Roger Clemens realizes that by challenging McNamee he is shaking MLB at its foundation. If Clemens is lying, he&#8217;s doing a lot more damage than had to be done. If he came out and admitted it right away, saying that he had to compete with all the hitters taking steroids, then nothing of this magnitude would&#8217;ve come from the Mitchell Report.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brian McNamee apparently lied before in a previous criminal trial out of Florida. This case was undisclosed at Congress but should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>One of the congressmen also alluded to several inconsistencies with McNamee&#8217;s testimony and concluded that McNamee lied initially to federal investigators when he withheld evidence of Clemens&#8217; steroid use. McNamee later presented syringes and and gauze pads doused with Clemens&#8217; blood and trace amounts of HGH.</p>
<p>The congressman was furious that McNamee would claim he was very good friends with Clemens, yet hold onto evidence for five years. Then, he didn&#8217;t present the evidence he held because he didn&#8217;t want to hurt Clemens, so he kind of was going back and forth with his loyalty to Clemens or to the truth.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s another sticking point that really hurts Roger Clemens if true. Clemens alleged initially when being questioned that he never ever talked about steroids or HGH with Brian McNamee. Later in the questioning he said that his wife was injected by Brian McNamee without his discretion.</p>
<p>His wife complained of an uncomfortable pain and a circulation problem near where she was injected (in the buttocks). Clemens was furious and alleged he fished through McNamee&#8217;s luggage to look for more HGH to throw it away.</p>
<p>He then called McNamee and had a &#8220;heated exchange&#8221; specifically about HGH. That would be a conversation specifically about HGH.</p>
<p>Clemens definitely screwed up here, and should have come clean about his wife&#8217;s HGH use before. It certainly hurts his credibility.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One thing that is really different in the testimonies of Brian McNamee and Roger Clemens is whether Roger Clemens attended a 3-day house party at Jose Canseco&#8217;s house during a 3-game series (June 8-10) between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Florida Marlins in 1998.</p>
<p>McNamee swears he saw Roger, Roger&#8217;s wife, Roger&#8217;s nanny, and Roger&#8217;s children at the party during the 3 days. Jose Canseco&#8217;s ex-wife Jessica claims she knows for sure that Roger&#8217;s wife was there, but was not sure about Roger himself. Roger&#8217;s nanny swears she saw Clemens at least once during the 3-day stay, and Roger&#8217;s wife and children stayed over Jose Canseco&#8217;s house at least one night.</p>
<p>Roger Clemens swears he was not there, providing a receipt for a round of golf on June 9, 1998. Many people, including Canseco, have said that Roger was not at the party during any point of the weekend.</p>
<p>Something else emerged when the evidence was stacked against McNamee in this story. McNamee told investigators that if they interviewed Clemens&#8217; nanny, she would tell them Clemens was there. They sought the nanny&#8217;s name from Clemens&#8217; lawyers, and they did not provide the information until Monday (2 days ago). The nanny testified that Clemens invited her to his house the day before (Sunday). Congressmen were upset that Clemens would contact the nanny before submitting her name over to investigators. Clemens argued that he told her to tell the truth. Interesting&#8230;</p>
