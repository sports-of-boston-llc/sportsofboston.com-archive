<p>Joe Kennedy was a solid left-hander in the big leagues throughout his whole career. At only 28, he was sure to have many years left as a middle reliever. His last game was on Sept. 29 while with the Toronto Blue Jays.</p>
<p>In his career against the Red Sox, Kennedy was 2-2 with a 4.45 ERA in 14 games (9 starts). In 56.2 innings against the Sox, he had a career 1.55 WHIP and .311 BAA.</p>
<p>Sports of Boston extends its condolences to friends, family, or anyone else affected by the tragic death of Joe Kennedy.</p>
<p>From ESPN.com&#8217;s Jerry Crasnick:</p>
<blockquote><p>Major league pitcher Joe Kennedy died early Friday morning while at home with his family in Florida, agent Damon Lapa confirmed to ESPN.com.</p>
<p>The cause of Kennedy&#8217;s death could not immediately be determined, Lapa said. Initial indications are Kennedy may have suffered a brain aneurysm or heart attack, he said.</p>
<p>Kennedy passed out at home and was brought to a hospital, Hillsborough County sheriff&#8217;s spokeswoman Debbie Carter told the Associated Press. She had no further details.</p>
<p>Kennedy, 28, compiled a 43-61 record in seven major league seasons with the Tampa Bay Rays, Colorado Rockies, Oakland Athletics, Arizona Diamondbacks and Toronto Blue Jays.</p></blockquote>
