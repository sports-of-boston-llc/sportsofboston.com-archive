Last season, Hull City had a remarkable start to the season, beating the likes of Arsenal early on before coming back to Earth and they nearly got relegated. This season, Burnley has donned the glass slipper and is tearing apart some of the EPL&#8217;s best teams from a year ago.</p>
<p>After an opening day defeat at the hands of Stoke City, Burnley returned home to it&#8217;s fortress at Turf Moor on Wednesday and faced the task of playing the three-time defending champions, Manchester United. So what did they do? Went out and beat them, 1-0, off a Robbie Blake volley in the 19th minute. The win shocked the champions and gave Burnley it&#8217;s first top flight points in 33 years. Fast forward to Sunday when, again at Turf Moor, Burnley used a first half goal from Wade Elliot to down Everton, 1-0, sending the blues to their second EPL defeat on the bounce. Burnley has made their mark on the young season but it certainly doesn&#8217;t get any easier. After a Carling Cup clash against Hartlepool, they face back to back road trips, one to Stamford Bridge and one to Anfield. If they can secure any sort of points from either of those matchups, they could already be well on their way to staying the EPL.<br />
