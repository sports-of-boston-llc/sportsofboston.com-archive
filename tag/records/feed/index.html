				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ten catches, 107 yards, 1 touchdown. Just another day at the office for New England&#8217;s diminutive wide receiver, Wes Welker.</p>
<p>After Sunday’s drubbing of Tampa Bay in London, Welker now ranks as the No. 1 receiver in the NFL with 96.8 yards per game, No. 1 with 46 receptions, is tied for third with 4 TDs, and ranks 13<sup>th</sup> in receiving yards with 484.</p>
<p>If you didn’t notice, Welker’s posted these impressive stats in just five games – he sat out weeks two and three due to a knee injury.</p>
<p>In a word: wow. At 5’9”, 185 pounds, Welker appears out of place among the giants of the gridiron. But the sixth-year receiver has proven he not only belongs on the field, he’s earned a place among some of the NFL’s all-time greats.</p>
<p>Pause for Christopher Walken-esque dramatic effect.</p>
<p>Yes, dear readers, Wesley Carter Welker—the man no one wanted in the 2004 NFL Draft, the man who was cut by the San Diego Chargers after just one game, the man who the Miami Dolphins traded for a second round and seventh round pick—has already chiseled his name on the sacred tablet that logs the accomplishments of the NFL’s greatest receivers.</p>
<p>And Welker’s name isn’t just on the list, it’s near the top and rising.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/10/28/just-how-good-is-wes-welker/">Just How Good is Wes Welker?</a> (1,090 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That question is most certainly the one you ask when you build as big a lead as the Patriots did on that <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/10/18/patriots-beat-down-titans-59-0/">Sunday afternoon against the Titans</a>. Tom Brady was pulled just after the start of the third quarter in favor of backup quarterback Brian Hoyer. Many have questioned whether it would have been better to leave Brady in longer and see if he could break the NFL record for TD passes (7) and total points (72). Quite frankly, I believe those people are short-sighted in their critique of Bill Belichick&#8217;s decision. Tom Brady has his name next to plenty of records already, and two more would be unnecessary at best, dangerous at worst.</p>
<p>The main reason to pull a quarterback is to protect him from injury. When said quarterback already has suffered a major injury once, it makes even more sense to limit his playtime. The risk was amplified by the severe weather conditions under which the Titans-Patriots game was played. A snowy, icy field makes it hard to get one&#8217;s footing, and it would have been easy for Brady&#8217;s feet to slide out from under him or twist the wrong way along the ice. The game was out of reach, so why risk an injury to the most important member of your team? The argument that it would give Brady more time to work on his mechanics falls in the face of the injury issue. Brady&#8217;s passing mechanics may have improved marginally (and he was throwing pretty well before he left; he had a <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/10/21/cracking-the-code-brady-and-the-perfect-passer-rating/">passer rating of 152.8</a>) if he continued to play in the second half, but the risk of injury is far greater than the opportunity to get a little better.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/10/26/reaching-for-nfl-single-game-records-to-pull-or-not-to-pull/">Reaching for NFL Single Game Records: To Pull or Not to Pull?</a> (436 words)</p>
