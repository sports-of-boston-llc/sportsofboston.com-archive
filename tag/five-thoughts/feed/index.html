(Al Bello/Getty Images)" ></a><p>The Patriots <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/01/10/slow-start-dooms-new-england-to-early-playoff-exit/">took quite the beating at the hands of the Ravens on Sunday</a> to lose their first home playoff game in the Belichick-Brady era. It wasn&#8217;t pretty, but it did tell us one thing—Wes Welker would not have made a difference. The Patriots were outplayed by so much that their top offensive weapon would not have led them to victory. Think about that for a second and realize what has become of the Patriots&#8217; dynasty.</p>
<p>The only good thing about the Patriots losing to the Ravens was that they finished out of the top eight in the NFL in 2009. Why is this a good thing? Well, if 2010 is an uncapped season, the NFL has certain rules that protect the strong teams from getting stronger. Rather than repeat the actual wording of the rules, I will sum it up in one sentence: The top eight  NFL teams cannot sign an unrestricted free agent without having one of their free agents sign with another team. With the Patriots losing to the Ravens on Sunday, they finished outside of the top eight and can spend their money at will, while big-pocket teams like the Colts, Cowboys, and Jets will have restrictions. Let&#8217;s face it; this Patriots team wasn&#8217;t going to win the Super Bowl this year so this is the second-best scenario.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/01/15/where-do-the-patriots-go-from-here/">Where Do the Patriots Go From Here?</a> (850 words)</p>

<p>With these developments you can imagine the attitude of Boston&#8217;s finest radio personalities. I heard everything from &#8220;the Patriots game against the Ravens doesn&#8217;t matter because they can&#8217;t beat the Chargers&#8221; to &#8220;the Ravens will win because they should have won back in Week 4.&#8221;</p>

What they do not know is who they will host in their first playoff game. Currently there are seven teams fighting for two wild card spots, which gives us so many different playoff scenarios it hurts my head just trying to comprehend it. However, the Patriots play a crucial role in a couple team&#8217;s playoff scenarios and could have a say in who they face in the first round of the playoffs.</p>
<p>For example, if the Patriots rest their starters and allow the Texans to win, they would completely eliminate the Dolphins, who need the Patriots to win. They would also virtually eliminate the Steelers and Jaguars, both of whom only have one playoff scenario in which the Patriots lose. New England could also try to win and eliminate the Texans from the playoffs if they feel they are the stronger opponent. In any case, the Patriots do not have a final say in who does and does not make the playoffs, but they can make it difficult for a couple teams to climb that final hurdle to reach the postseason.</p>

Here are my five thoughts on the Patriots&#8217; playoff hopes this season:</p>
<h2>Patriots lack a signature win</h2>
<p>The Patriots just won their first legitimate road game and it was against the lowly Bills. The Patriots best wins have come against the Falcons, Ravens and Dolphins, who are all 8-6 or worse. The Patriots had their chances against the Broncos, Colts and Saints, but weren&#8217;t able to close out the opponent. Their struggles on the road are a huge concern because they will have to play two road games to make the Super Bowl. By comparison, Oakland has beat Denver, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and Philadelphia. Anytime you can draw comparisons to the Oakland Raiders and they come out on top, it&#8217;s not a good thing.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/12/25/who-are-these-patriots/">Who Are These Patriots?</a> (450 words)</p>

The Patriots struggled in all facets of the game and it showed with a 38-17 blowout. With the loss to the Saints, the Patriots now fall to 7-4 on the season and 1-4 on the road. As  teams get ready for the stretch run, the Patriots stand in fourth place in the AFC and have yet to validate their season with a signature win. They are going to need some help from both San Diego and Cincinnati if they want any chance to attain that elusive playoff bye week. Many people are saying that this is the end of a dynasty, but I think that&#8217;s a bit of an overreaction considering that our defense is in a transition period.</p>
<p>Anyways, after Monday night&#8217;s beating the question must be raised: Has this Patriots defense been a mirage? Before this week the defense was doing very well by my standards, but with all the mistakes and missed tackles it leads us to wonder which defense we are going to see going forward. My five thoughts:<br />

<p>In addition to the much needed win, the Patriots also got extremely lucky with the Steelers and Bengals both losing to inferior opponents in the Chiefs and Raiders so now the Patriots find themselves back into the mix for the No. 2 seed (and second playoff bye) and have a tough challenge ahead of them as they travel to New Orleans to face the undefeated Saints on Monday night. My five thoughts:</p>
<h2>Wes Welker is the difference maker</h2>
<p>In Week 2, the Patriots dropped a game to the Jets because of their inefficiency to put the ball in the end zone. I have <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/10/27/what-happened-to-parity-in-the-nfl/">talked about</a> how much of a difference Welker makes in the red zone and it is obvious that his presence on the field makes Brady more comfortable in the pocket. Welker finished Sunday&#8217;s game with career highs in receptions (15) and yards (192) and while he didn&#8217;t find the end zone, it was clear that Brady was focused on him the entire game while Randy Moss and Darrelle Revis were battling on their own island.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/11/26/is-wes-welker-a-top-five-wr/">Is Wes Welker a Top-Five WR?</a> (737 words)</p>

Sound familiar? First week of the season when the Buffalo Bills outplayed the Patriots for 55 minutes before Tom Brady connected for two touchdowns to give the Patriots the <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/09/15/brady-pats-find-stride-late-beat-bills-25-24/">25-24 win</a>. Buffalo gave the Patriots a gift by fumbling the kickoff return and the Patriots gave the Colts a gift by failing to convert on fourth down. Well, maybe the referees gave the Colts the gift because if you have a different officiating crew on the field Sunday night you could have a different result.</p>
<p>That’s what sucks the most about the loss because you could watch that play 100 times and still not know for sure whether it was a first down or not. I happen to think Kevin Faulk got the first down, but that’s just one guy’s opinion. I fully expect these two teams to meet again in the AFC Championship game and add another chapter in what is becoming one of the greatest rivalries the NFL has ever seen. My five thoughts:</p>

Instead they got a sunny, 65-degree day, which is what you would expect from a Miami home game. Despite the wacky weather, the Patriots still managed to put together a <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/11/08/patriots-sink-dolphins-27-17/">27-17</a> victory over the Dolphins.</p>
<p>Whether it was Stephen Gostkowski taking Tedd Ginn, Jr. out of the game by kicking balls out of the end zone on kickoffs or Randy Moss giving Vontae Davis a nice hand to the face, the Patriots put forth a full team effort and furthered themselves from the rest of the AFC East.</p>
<h2>Porter comes up empty after running his mouth</h2>
<p>Zero tackles and zero sacks. Maybe next time Joey Porter will think twice before mouthing off about how the Patriots get favorable treatment because not only does it provide extra motivation for a team that is already better, but it also puts a target on your back. If you talk trash, you need to back it up plain and simple. As someone once told me: you can’t have your cake and eat it too.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/11/11/vollmer-patriots-silence-joey-porter/">Vollmer, Patriots Silence Joey Porter</a> (796 words)</p>

Since when did the bad teams in the NFL get so bad? (AP Photo/Stephan Savoia)" ></a><p>Another week, another blowout. The Patriots didn’t need much to beat the winless Bucs, but the offense had another great game in the <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/10/25/pats-cross-the-pond-and-bombard-the-bucs/">35-7 blowout</a>. Tom Brady threw for another three touchdowns, giving him 15 on the season (were we actually <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/10/21/patriots-first-in-afc-east-brady-is-back-or-is-he/">worried about this guy?</a>), and the defense continued to play well with Meriweather’s two interceptions (one for a touchdown). We saw the returns of Junior Seau and Tully Banta-Cain (it’s like he never left) while Sam Aiken scored his first career offensive touchdown. Overall, it was a very solid game for everyone on the Patriots, minus the running game (read below) and the Patriots showed that no matter where the NFL makes them play football, they will beat up on inferior opponents. Next stop, Mars!</p>
<p>Honestly, when the team is rolling like this and playing inferior competition, there isn’t much to talk about. If I had to write this column in 2007 I would be pulling my hair out trying to think of things to write (there are only so many “Wow! Brady is so awesome!” articles one man can write). Do not fear, however, because I did manage to think of four other talking points that tie-in with the Patriots. Well, <em>one</em> may be a stretch, but regardless here are my thoughts.</p>
<h2>The NFL&#8217;s Sudden Disparity</h2>
<p>The fact that the Patriots have played two consecutive winless teams made me think about how bad the NFL is this year. The competition in the NFL has gotten relatively weak and it was on showcase this Sunday as the average margin of victory in the 12 games was 21.2 points.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/10/27/what-happened-to-parity-in-the-nfl/">What Happened to Parity in the NFL?</a> (757 words)</p>
