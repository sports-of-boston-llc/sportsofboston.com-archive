Lauck / The Advocate) " ></a><p>This summer has been like no other for the Bayou Bengals, but with its big showdown against Oregon just one week away the Tigers must attempt to put all the negatives of a long offseason behind them.</p>
<p>In July, the NCAA slapped LSU with a one-year <a href="http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/6784149/ncaa-hits-lsu-one-year-probation-recruiting-restrictions" target="_blank">probation</a> stemming from improper benefits to former Tiger defensive lineman Akiem Hicks in 2009. That same week LSU was linked with Houston-based Will Lyles of Complete Scouting Services. LSU paid Lyles $6,000 for video on junior college recruits, amongst other things. An ESPN Outside the Lines <a href="http://aol.sportingnews.com/ncaa-football/story/2011-07-21/lsu-didnt-get-much-for-6k-paid-to-lyles" target="_blank">report</a> cited that the video quality was poor and contained players that were already with collegiate programs.</p>
<p>LSU hasn&#8217;t been charged with anything from the NCAA, but it was an attempt from ESPN to shine a blacklight on Lyles as the NCAA was investigating the Lache Seastrunk-Oregon &#8220;fiasco.&#8221;</p>
<p>A month earlier, defensive end Sam Montgomery and quarterback Zach Mettenberger had a <a href="http://theadvocate.com/home/674692-79/charges-to-be-filed-involving.html" target="_blank">gun pulled</a> on them in a parking lot on LSU&#8217;s campus. The players weren&#8217;t hurt and no charges for Montgomery and Mettenberger should surface. The two had to identify the man with a gun, later after he was arrested by police.</p>
<p>Matters worsened in Baton Rouge.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2011/08/27/whats-next-for-lsu-after-arrests-of-jordan-jefferson-josh-johns/">What&#8217;s Next For LSU After Arrests of Jordan Jefferson, Josh Johns?</a> (512 words)</p>
