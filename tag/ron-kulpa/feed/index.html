<p><span style="line-height: 1.5">Top of the ninth, bases loaded, one out, down by one run, Big Papi is up. Nobody else you&#8217;d rather have at bat in this situation. Ortiz had a great chance to capitalize late in the game and put the Sox in the lead but had his chances stolen from him by not one, but two very questionable strikes called by home plate umpire Ron Kulpa.</span></p>
<p>One of the best closers in baseball, Andrew Miller, found himself in a jam as the Red Sox had bases loaded as Big Papi came to the plate. Ortiz worked a 3-1 count. Miller delivered a low and outside slider for a called strike making it a 3-2 count. Ortiz immediately turned to Kulpa with his arms spread wide and yelling &#8220;NO!&#8221; as he did not agree with the call. John Farrell rushed to Ortiz to restrain him because the at bat was not over and they still needed him to hit. Farrell backed up Ortiz and continued to deliver some pretty heated words towards Kulpa as he ejected the Sox manager from the game.</p>
<p>Still visually upset, Ortiz still had a job to do at the plate. The next pitch was again delivered low and outside but was even lower than the previous pitch. Ortiz watched it for strike three as Kulpa rung him up. Ortiz put his head down and walked back to the bench. But when he got to the dugout, he snapped and ran out to Kulpa screaming his head off. John Farrell and other members of the team had to restrain Ortiz from ripping Kulpa&#8217;s head off for the two bad calls against him.</p>
<p>The game should have been tied with 1 out and Hanley Ramirez at the plate but that wasn&#8217;t the case. Those two picthes were balls, I don&#8217;t care what anybody says. According to the &#8220;K-Zone,&#8221; Kulpa <strong>missed 31 calls </strong>in last night&#8217;s game. The 3-2 strike called on Ortiz was reported to be five and half inches below the strike zone. That&#8217;s a pretty big screw up in a tight game like that, especially between the Sox and Yanks.</p>
<p>Everyone knows those were bad calls. The umpire missed the first one but missing the second one too is a big no no, you just can&#8217;t do that. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen Ortiz that mad before. We&#8217;ve all seen him mad but last night was something else. If I saw Papi sprinting at me like that, I don&#8217;t even know what I would do with myself. He was down right scary last night.</p>
