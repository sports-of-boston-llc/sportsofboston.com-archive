In the beginning of the season, Blake Swihart was the starting catcher. Not too long after that he started to lose time to Ryan Hanigan and Christian Vazquez. Soon after Vazquez was thrown into the mix, Swihart was not seen again at the catching position and was dropped down to the AAA Pawtucket Red Sox.</p>
<p>For the majority of the season, Vazquez has been the everyday catcher with Hanigan catching a game or two here and there. But on June 5th Hanigan suffered a neck strain and was put on the 15 day DL. So most recently we have seen Vazquez sharing time at catcher with Sandy Leon, who is batting 10 for 16 (.625) on the season. Vazquez has seen significantly more time than any other catcher the Sox have had this year, but I question this. Christian is batting only .221 this year but is a pretty good defensive catcher with a strong arm. I just question why with a guy like Leon who has been hitting very well when he gets in, doesn&#8217;t see a little more playing time. I understand he&#8217;s only had 16 at bats, but when a guy is that hot coming into his first at bats of the season, you usually keep him in and see what he can do.</p>
<p>The biggest question the Sox face is who is going to be their left fielder. I feel like every time I watch them there&#8217;s someone different in left. The Sox started the season with Brock Holt as their starting left fielder. He played pretty much every day in left and performing at an average rate. But when he suffered a concussion on May 20th, he was put on the DL and hasn&#8217;t returned since. Holt is recovering from a concussion slower than normally but concussions are taken much more seriously now a days since we know so much more about the dangers of them. Holt is currently rehabbing with the Paw Sox and he is batting 3 for 6, with two doubles in two games. His return date to the Red Sox is uncertain but I can imagine when he get&#8217;s back he will be thrown right back into the lineup to see how he performs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when Holt was gone, left field saw action from mainly two different players; Chris Young and Blake Swihart. When Swihart was sent down to the minors, he decided that his best chance at playing for the Red Sox would be to switch to outfield and compete for the left field spot. Being the athletic and quick player he is, he transformed himself into a surprisingly well outfielder. Him and Chris Young would split time with each other in left. But Swihart was placed n the 15 day DL when he severely sprained his ankle running into a wall. So this leaves Chris Young alone, who has been playing left almost every day for the Sox and performing fairly well. He is batting .282 on the season and has had some big hits for the Sox this season. He has turned himself into a guy that we could see as an everyday player in the outfield.</p>
<p>But the thing is, when Holt finally comes back the Sox are going to put him back in left to compete with Young. Which is fair because he lost his starting spot due to injury. However it is not a given that Brock will just get his starting spot back because he was only batting .239 at the time of his injury, so it&#8217;s going to be a battle between the two. And when Swihart returns from his injury, who knows what&#8217;s going to happen because he was also hitting and playing fairly well in left.</p>
<p>Now the problem I have with all of this is that many teams don&#8217;t play well when there&#8217;s constant changes to the starting lineup. Most teams have the same guys at the same positions for the majority of the games. The Red Sox seem to have a different lineup every night. Whether its the catcher, the left fielder, the second baseman, or Ortiz has a day off; its always different. Having too many changes to a lineup too often can screw up the flow or momentum of a team. I blame a good amount of losses to this problem. John Farrell has made many Sox fans angry this year with his questionable choices in just about any decision he makes. As the season goes on, Farrell needs to make up his mind of who his every day players are because playing musical chairs with these guys all year just isn&#8217;t going to work.</p>

Young was only in left field because Blake Swihart &#8220;severely sprained&#8221; his right ankle in a game against the Blue Jays, and Swihart was only in left because Brock Holt is on the disabled list with a concussion.</p>
<p>All three players are more than capable in the outfield. Swihart has exceptional speed for a utility man, Holt was an All-Star last year, and Young was a reliable starter for the Diamondbacks from 2006-2012 (Young enjoyed short stints playing for the A&#8217;s, Mets and Yankees from 2013-2015). With three viable options, who will emerge as the starting left fielder for the Red Sox?</p>
<p>Holt was originally the man during both spring training and the beginning of the season, but was not hitting as well as he was last year. Swihart was recalled from Triple-A Pawtucket when Holt went down with a concussion. Swihart provided added speed, hitting three triples in 19 games, and batting at .258. The Red Sox seemed to show faith in Swihart, and questions arose as to whether the Red Sox would be looking at Swihart for a long term option in left, or a trade chip in a potential deal.</p>

It assumes a 16 team mixed-league <strong>keeper</strong> format with a standard 5&#215;5 scoring system and a 22 man roster with the following positional requirements: C (1), 1B (1), 2B (1), 3B (1), SS (1), CI (1), MI (1), OF (3), UT (3), SP (5), RP (4). </span><span style="font-weight: 400">All statistical information is referenced from FanGraphs.com. </span>As the title of the post suggests, today we will start by focusing on the catchers.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Buster Posey (SF)</strong></p>
<p>This guy is the cream of the crop and has been for years now. He has lifetime batting average above .300 against both right handed (RHP) and left handed pitching (LHP), and makes consistent hard contact at the plate. Posey is the heart and soul of the San Francisco Giants and, given his durability and ability to play first-base, is a lock for 500+ at-bats per year. His profile stands alone in the catcher rankings once again this season.</p>
<p><strong>Kyle Schwarber (CHC), Brian McCann (NYY)</strong></p>
<p>Schwarber is a lock for keeper leagues. He may lose his catcher eligibility after this season, but no matter where he plays and whether he learns how to hit for a higher average, he has elite power.</p>
<p>Then there is McCann who has caught more MLB games than Schwarber has played in total. I put him in the category because he is a proven asset. Another plus: his average fly ball ratio over the past three seasons lends itself to some juicy slugging potential at Yankee Stadium. Schwarber will go much earlier in the draft because of his keeper prospects and a bullish market, so McCann may offer the better value pick of the two.</p>
<p><strong>Travis D&#8217;Arnaud (NYM), Jonathan Lucroy (MIL)</strong></p>
<p>These two are high risk, high reward players. They both have concerning injury histories (D&#8217;Arnaud more so than Lucroy) and the latter has openly stated his desire to leave Milwaukee. Neither of these are promising developments for fantasy owners. D&#8217;Arnaud has a higher ceiling of the two if you&#8217;re willing to take the chance, but neither are comfortable picks.</p>
<p><strong>Salvador Perez (KC), Russell Martin (TOR), J.T. Realmuto (MIA)</strong></p>
<p>Perez plays nearly every inning for the Royals and although his walk rate somehow fell to just 2% last, his consistent contact rate (86%) and line drive tendency (21%) over the past three seasons show the potential to continue to succeed.</p>
<p>Russell Martin took his talents to Canada in 2015 and once again produced solid numbers. While is high home-run to fly-ball ratio last season (21%) suggests some power regression and he struggled against right-handed pitching last year, Martin is the workhorse for Toronto whose offensive output will get help from that potent lineup.</p>
<p>This last player in this tier is Realmuto. He may not sound familiar but remember the name. Only 24 years old, he has been a line drive hitter in his two seasons in MLB (27%) and makes consistent contact (82%). On top of the intriguing bat tool, he runs very well for a catcher and a 10+ SB season is conceivable.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Vogt (OAK),  Nick Hundley (COL), Welington Castillo (AZ)</strong></p>
<p>Vogt stands out statistically among these three but his struggles against left-handed pitching last season (.631 OPS) could land him in a platoon role for the Athletics this year.</p>
<p>Rockies&#8217; starting catcher Nick Hundley had the best season of his career in 2015 with a .300 batting average and 10 HR. He has historically been a better hitter against RHP in his career, but in the second half of last season exploded for a .915 OPS against LHP after managing a mere .575 OPS in the first half. Don&#8217;t expect a full repeat of 2015, but if he can carry this success against RHP in to this season Hundley will have a productive season at Coors Field.</p>
<p>Finally, Castillo. He didn&#8217;t show the ability to make consistent contact last year (73%) but the 2015 ISO of .216 demonstrates his raw power. He has the potential to hit 15-20 HR, especially at Chase Field.</p>
<p><strong>Miguel Montero (CHC), Yasmani Grandal (LAD), Blake Swihart (BOS), Yadier Molina (STL)</strong></p>
<p>Montero and Grandal are both mid-level power options that won&#8217;t hit for much of an average. Montero simultaneously had his contact rate drop to 70% and line drive rate rise to 26% last season, which led to a substantial power increase.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at 27 years old, Grandal has had trouble making contact over the past three season (73%) and hits for a low batting average. He is the starting&#8217; catcher for the Dodgers, but A.J Ellis is sure to take some at bats. Swihart is in this tier because of his keeper value. He is a blossoming hitter and has above average speed for a catcher. The problem in the short term is Red Sox&#8217;s catching depth, as he and Vasquez will likely to split the bulk of the time this season.</p>
<p>Then there is Yadier Molina. Long gone are the days of Molina&#8217;s fantasy prominence. He has proven himself a line drive hitter that makes consistent contact, but he is no longer going to provide double digit home runs. Will play every day if he avoids injury, but don&#8217;t expect the Yadi of the past.</p>
<p><strong>Derek Norris (SD), Francisco Cervelli (PIT), Yan Gomes (CLE)</strong></p>
<p>Yan Gomes has injury history that is worrisome, and while he has hit a lot of line drives in the last two seasons (25%), his low contact (71%) and walk (3%) rates do not show me a comfortable hitter at the plate.</p>
<p>Cervelli will catch everyday for the Pirates IF he can stay healthy, but that is a big if. His high contact (78%) and line drive rates (25%) produce a high average but the problem is he is a one category contributor.</p>
<p>Norris, conversely, had trouble making contact last season (75%) and exhibited a troubling platoon split (810 OPS vL, 678 OPS  vR), neither of which inspire optimism. Austin Hedges and Christian Bethancourt are knocking on the door for his duties and a platoon in San Diego is the likely conclusion this season.</p>
<p><strong>Devin Mesoraco (CIN), Wilson Ramos (WAS)</strong></p>
<p>Devin Mesoraco, like Yan Gomes, is another risky player. I&#8217;m staying away him because of his low line drive (13.9%) and hard-hit ball rates (19.4%) in limited time at the end of last season. He is also coming off of hip surgery. He offers potential but has a lot to prove.</p>
<p>Wilson Ramos seems to be on the decline as well. His contact rate has plummeted in each of the past two seasons and his average ground ball rate over the past three seasons (56%) does not suggest a power rebirth. What keeps owners interested in both of these catchers is the potential power output, but it does not look promising.</p>
<hr />
<p>Get a top tier catcher or you&#8217;ll be fighting for the best of the worst. A common theme among the is consistency vs high risk, high reward. I tend to favor consistency at the catcher position, but it all depends on your strategy as an owner. My player to target from this list is J.T. Realmuto. He will handle the primary catching responsibilities for the Marlins this year and is potential keeper who could produce 15 HR and 10 SB for years to come.</p>
<p><strong>Fishing for Prospects:</strong></p>
<p>Before concluding each week, there will be a prospect you should keep an eye on throughout this season as a potential keeper for your team down the road. Depending on how many keepers your league allows this portion may or may not offer relevance. Fair warning on looking for keepers at the catcher position &#8211; they&#8217;re very rarely a good investment.</p>
<p><strong>Reese McGuire (PIT)</strong></p>
<p>The Pirates selected McGuire out of Kentwood Senior High School in Washington with 14th overall in the first round of the 2013 MLB draft. Now just age 20, McGuire has progressed smoothly in his two seasons of professional baseball and played last season in the Advanced Class-A Florida State League. The Pirates developmental philosophy for catchers stresses defense over offense, which McGuire as bought in to. This may hinder his progression as a hitter but puts him on a faster track to make his debut at PNC Park. McGuire&#8217;s naturally advanced, high contact approach from the left-hand batters box offers promise as a hitter, and with more time to develop he could become a strong catcher in MLB. Don&#8217;t expect him on the Pirates roster this year, but down the road McGuire is a name to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>We will move on to first-basemen next week.</p>

Since there is always a give/take, ying/yang, etc. we will cover both ends of the emotional spectrum, but for now let’s start on a positive note and take a look at three areas of organizational strength that can be built upon going forward.</p>
<h2>The Lineup</h2>
<p>It’s no secret that the Red Sox need a good amount of pitching improvements if they want to contend in 2016 and beyond. The everyday lineup, however, appears to be in very good shape as currently constituted. Five Red Sox posted an OPS right at or near .800: <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=745&amp;position=DH">David Ortiz</a> (.913), <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8370&amp;position=2B">Dustin Pedroia</a> (.797), <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=13611&amp;position=OF">Mookie Betts</a> (.820), <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=12984&amp;position=OF">Jackie Bradley Jr.</a> (.832), and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=11982&amp;position=1B">Travis Shaw</a> (.822). Additionally, the Red Sox as a team <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=bat&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=0&amp;type=8&amp;season=2015&amp;month=0&amp;season1=&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0,ts&amp;players=0">finished among the Major League leaders</a> in several offensive categories including:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6<sup>th</sup> in Batting Average &#8211; .265</p>
<p>5<sup>th</sup> in OBP &#8211; .325</p>
<p>7<sup>th</sup> in Slugging &#8211; .415</p>
<p>4<sup>th</sup> in Runs Scored – 748</p>
<p>4<sup>th</sup> in RBI &#8211; 706</p>
<p>6<sup>th</sup> in wOBA &#8211; .321</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pretty impressive. Keep in mind that all of this was accomplished despite two of the lineup’s alleged staples – <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8001&amp;position=SS">Hanley Ramirez</a> and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=5409&amp;position=3B">Pablo Sandoval</a> – were worse than replacement level and a complete drain on the offense. The Red Sox had a top-6 offense in the baseball in 2015, with potential to be top-3 in 2016.</p>

The main point of this article is that the Red Sox <em>can</em> trade for <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=12768&amp;position=P">Sonny Gray</a>. The Red Sox have had the ability to trade for the ace that they so desperately need for quite some time; they just have not felt comfortable making that move. Now that the team has come to the point where they really need an ace to contend for the postseason, they should be aiming as high as possible in their search for a star starting pitcher.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the options are not as plentiful as the Red Sox would like. Despite some rumors that the White Sox <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/rosenblog/ct-white-sox-trade-market-sale-rosenbloom-20150630-column.html">should shop Chris Sale</a> at the deadline, the team has <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2015/06/cafardo-on-sale-ramirez-uehara-papelbon.html">flat-out denied that strategy</a>. The Red Sox have been trying to trade for <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=4772&amp;position=P">Felix Hernandez</a> for years, to no avail, and the Phillies seem to have an <a href="http://m.phillies.mlb.com/news/article/121356552/philadelphia-phillies-in-no-hurry-to-trade-cole-hamels-or-jonathan-papelbon">unreasonable price tag</a> on <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=4972&amp;position=P">Cole Hamels</a>. There have also been reports that the Red Sox are not interested in any of the “rental” arms on this year’s trade market, such as <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=6893&amp;position=P">Johnny Cueto</a>, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=3184&amp;position=P">David Price</a>, or <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=3254&amp;position=P">Jeff Samardzija</a>. This seems to leave Oakland’s Sonny Gray as the most logical trade target for the Red Sox’ rotation.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Sox fans (and Ben Cherington), the Clay Buchholz we all hope will pitch came to the ballpark last Tuesday to open up the home stand against the Twins. Buchholz was brilliant, throwing 8.0 innings, giving up just three hits, and no earned runs, while striking out eight.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/06/08/red-sox-stand-tall-take-five-out-of-seven-at-fenway/">Red Sox Stand Tall, Take Five Out of Seven at Fenway</a> (724 words)</p>
