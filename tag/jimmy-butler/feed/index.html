There have been rumors of many teams that Durant may have interest in joining including the Celtics, Warriors, Heat, Lakers, Magic, Trail Blazers, Spurs, Mavericks, and possibly returning to the Thunder.</p>
<p>There have also been rumors of Durant&#8217;s agent sending a list to the Celtics of players that Kevin wants if he&#8217;s going to come to Boston. We don&#8217;t know if this is true but I wouldn&#8217;t doubt it. Durant has come so close to the NBA Finals too many times. If he wants to leave the Thunder he needs to know that the players on his new team are legit and will give him a chance to win a championship. We do know that Durant wants a &#8220;Big 3&#8221; type deal with a new team if he decides to leave the Thunder. If he came to Boston he would already have point guard Isaiah Thomas who is starting to look like a superstar in this league. If the Celtics want their chance at landing Durant in Boston they need to acquire another dominant player.</p>
<h2>Other Possible Players for the Celtics</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Al Horford</strong>
<ul>
<li>Dominant big man who can space the floor</li>
<li>Can do a little bit of everything</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Jimmy Butler</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gifted athletically</li>
<li>Very good scorer to the basket</li>
<li>Outstanding defensive player</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Hassan Whiteside</strong>
<ul>
<li>One of the best defensive centers in the NBA</li>
<li>Very good rebounder (averaged 11.8 REB per game last season)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Buddy Hield</strong>
<ul>
<li>Good three point shooter</li>
<li>Hasn&#8217;t established himself yet but could be threat right away in the NBA</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The list goes on.</p>
<p>Who knows what&#8217;s going to happen but from what we&#8217;re hearing, the Celtics seem like they are completely serious about landing some big name players. However many people don&#8217;t see it as a realistic possibility for Durant to come play for Boston. I also bet many people never thought Pierce, Garnett, and Allen would be a thing but look what happened. The trade deadline is about as month away so there could be some big news for Boston this month.</p>
<p>Also I don&#8217;t know how many people saw this but on May 31st at 1:15 AM, Isaiah Thomas tweeted a number 35 with a four leaf clover emoji next to it, but he shortly deleted the tweet after. You can take it however you want but this only made me more confident that Isaiah is luring Durant to come play for Boston.</p>

Trade this pick for an established superstar?  Draft ANOTHER young player who won&#8217;t pan out for the next 3-5 years?  It must be tough to be Danny Ainge this time of year.</p>
<p>Danny Ainge has a reputation around the league of getting the best of trades.  I challenge anyone to give me a trade that Danny has lost.  Every blockbuster trade that has involved The Celtics the last few years have been in their favor, and it&#8217;s not even close.  The Kevin Garnett trade, the Ray Allen trade, the Brooklyn trade, the Rondo trade, even the Jeff Green trade.  All trades that have benefited The Celtics and hurt their trade partner.  If Danny is going to make a big splash this offseason, he&#8217;s going to have to talk someone else into giving up a superstar caliber player.</p>
<p>With Ben Simmons and Brandon Ingram likely being off the board when the Celtics select.  Danny&#8217;s first action should be looking for a trade.  Guys like, Jimmy Butler, Paul George, and Demarcus Cousins have been all the talk around Boston.  All of these guys will take a king&#8217;s ransom to acquire, but for the right deal they could all be in green next season.  What should Danny be willing to give up?  With all these players and picks he has acquired through the years it&#8217;s time to cash in, in other words if Indiana wants this year&#8217;s pick, next year&#8217;s Brooklyn&#8217;s pick and Jae Crowder then you do it.  It&#8217;s time for this &#8220;Fireworks&#8221; statement to be true.</p>
<p>If there is no trade to be made before or on draft night and Ainge is forced to take a player, he has to take someone who can help this team sooner rather than later.  Jamal Murray from Kentucky would be my pick at number 3.  Murray who is 19 years old could be a star in the league someday, standing at 6&#8217;5 he could be a 2 guard and a small wing player.  Murray seems like the guy who wants to take the big shot, who wants the ball in crunch time.  Last season he averaged 20 points, 5 rebounds, and just about 3 assists on the season.  His best basketball moment came on the international stage.  In the 2015 Pan Am games Murray was playing for team Canada.  In a game against the USA, Murray was scoreless through the first 3 quarters, but then exploded in the fourth.  Scoring 22 points while dishing out 6 assists in the fourth quarter he led Canada to a 111-108 win over the USA.  This is the type of player the Celtics need.  Murray can take over a game and would be a great compliment to Isaiah Thomas.  If you&#8217;re not going to trade the pick than Murray is the guy to go after.</p>
<p>The NBA draft is June 23rd.</p>

The only loss in their last five games was a close one when Boston travelled to San Antonio and fell 108-105 to the Spurs (18-5). Boston has also notched four straight home court wins and is averaging 108.0 points per game in their last five games, this will be important if they want to have a chance against the high octane Golden State Warriors.</p>
<p>The C&#8217;s are coming off an impressive team performance against the Bulls in which eight players scored in double figures without a single one playing over 40 minutes. Isaiah Thomas again led the scoring charge with 20 points, 5 assists and 5 rebounds. Jared Sullinger continued to clean the glass with 16 rebounds to go with his 10 points and Kelly Olynyk once again provided a spark off the bench pouring in 15 points in just 20 minutes of action. Ex-Warriors big man David Lee got back in the flow last night after missing time with a bruised heel to score 12 points and snatch six rebounds. Chicago, who now sit at 11-8, third in the central division behind Cleveland and Indiana put up a fight until the final bell. Jimmy Butler dropped 36 points and nabbed seven boards while Gasol was good for a double-double in points and rebounds with 16 and 15, respectively. A face mask-wearing Derek Rose had 12 points and six assists in the loss.</p>
<p>Boston is coming into this game flying high. Success on the road plus a good win in a tight game at home has the guys in green as ready as ever for the matchup with the champs. However, there is no doubt the undefeated Warriors come into the game, despite key injuries to Harrison Barnes and Klay Thompson, with ultimate confidence. Why shouldn&#8217;t they be confident? They have stepped on the court 23 times this season and won all 23 games, it seems like everyday they are breaking or about to break another consecutive win record.</p>
<p>The matchup is interesting for many reasons, statistically the Warriors rank 1st in the NBA in offensive efficiency, 1st in 3-point FG points per game and rarely turn the ball over ranking 24th in the league in that regard. On the flip side the Celtics rank 3rd in the NBA in defensive efficiency, 4th in 3-point FG points per game and are 1st in defensive turnovers. Putting the stats on the back burner for a minute, someone that watches the Celtics can see they pass the eye test as well. This team is deep, they keep fresh legs on the floor, they have young athletes that can get up and down with Golden State to contest and try to keep them from scoring easy transition buckets, and they have the ability to defend the three point shot, at least as good as anyone can against a Warriors team with a plethora of shooters.</p>
<p>As far as offensive and defensive personnel for both teams, Steph Curry may be the best offensive player in basketball right now but the Celtics have one of the better defenders at the guard position in Avery Bradley. An interesting play may also be to try the longer Evan Turner on Curry in efforts to disrupt his hair-trigger release and to mix in different looks defensively.</p>
<p>A major advantage that Golden State has over most teams is their ability to go to the smaller line up and have success. They have so many skill players with Draymond Green perhaps being the best example. Green is someone that can bang down low and guard on the perimeter then turn around and knock down threes or drive to the basket on offense. The Celtics also have a lot of skill players and bigs that can stretch the floor making the Warriors work on defense just as they force opponents to night in and night out. Trying to keep pace in a run and gun style with the Warriors would surely be a mistake however the option to play with a smaller line up may help the Celtics manage the tempo without giving up blow-by layups and penetration on the defensive end.</p>
<p>Offensively the Celtics can help themselves by playing disciplined basketball, getting up good shots, continuing the balanced attack, and making the Warriors play defense for the majority of the shot clock. Another key will be taking care of the basketball. Carelessness will lead to layups and transitions threes and no one puts up points faster than Golden State.</p>
<p>For the Warriors, who will be going for the NBA record for most consecutive road wins, they have a big question mark named Klay Thompson. At this point he is listed as a game-time decision after tweaking his ankle in a 131-123 win over the Pacers Tuesday in which he lit them up for 39 points and went 10-16 from behind the arc. If Thompson doesn&#8217;t play and Barnes continues to sit as planned, the Celtics can focus more efforts on Curry, perhaps trying to trap him, double him, aggressively hedge screens and do anything else in their power to make him give up the basketball. This season the reigning MVP, averaging 32.2 points per game, has shown he is not just a shooter, he&#8217;s a pure scorer, a passer, and a playmaker with other worldly handles. Steph Curry and the team basketball culture this Golden State team brings out each night is truly a spectacle and a treat for all basketball fans. Most of the time Curry has the ball on a string and during this win streak seems to be making all the right decisions with the rock. However with increased pressure from a barrage of Celtics defenders and his one and two wing options in suit coats he will have to be special to create for himself and make plays for teammates. If Thompson does play the task will be a tall one for Boston but with the spirit of this young, hungry Celtics team its unlikely they would want it any other way.</p>
<p>If the Warriors are able to get by the Celtics they play their next four games against teams with records of .500 or worse before the Christmas Day NBA Finals rematch against Lebron James and the Cavaliers at Oracle Arena in Oakland. The Warriors have remained humble and hungry on this record setting season which will serve them well as Brad Stevens will have the Celtics geared up and locked in for what is sure to be a raucous TD Garden on Friday night in Boston. Tip-off is set for 7:30 as the C&#8217;s try to dethrone the undefeated and undisputed heavyweight champs of the NBA.</p>

Boston came into the game sitting at 10-8 going 2-3 in there last 5 games and in second place in the Atlantic Division behind Toronto. The C&#8217;s put one in the win column taking it to the Kings 114-97 with four Celtics scoring twenty or more points.</p>
<p>Isaiah Thomas, who continues in the starting line up, and Kelly Olynyk, a spark off the bench, each put up 21 points in the victory while Avery Bradley and Jae Crowder both notched 20-point games as well. The Celtics continued their balanced attack and seemed to play everyone with 12 players scoring in the game. Thomas maintained his average as coming into the game he was scoring 20.8 points per game and Avery Bradley knocking in 16.1 per contest. Other key players moving forward include Jared Sullinger and Jae Crowder both averaging double figures and Evan Turner who is close averaging 9.0 points per game adding solid defense and play-making on offense.</p>
<p>Sacramento hasn&#8217;t exactly gotten off to a blistering pace with their 7-13 record however they have been hampered by injury in the form of a back strain for Demarcus Cousins and are now 6-6 in games that he has played in. Cousins, a player much sought after by Danny Ainge and the Celtics this off season, was averaging 28.2 points per game in the contests in which he has been able to play coming into the game against the Celtics. Former Celtics point guard Rajon Rondo was averaging a shade under 13 points and 10.7 assists per game and hoping he and Cousins can get this Kings team out of the basement of Pacific division (Also known as the Golden State division), and at least compete for an eight seed in the wild western conference.</p>
<p>The Celtics were able to hold Cousins to just 16 points and seven rebounds in twenty four minutes of action. Rondo scored five points and dished out eight assists in the loss. Rudy Gay appeared to be the only Kings player to really shine scoring 18 points and ripping down seven boards. Heading into the game most were excited about the match up between the always difficult to handle Rondo and a great defender in Avery Bradley, as well as the rotation of Celtics bigs in the trenches against a powerful low post presence in Cousins. Boston was able to get the best of that match up to get a victory south of the border. The Kings also lost rookie center Willie Cauley-Stein during the game with a dislocated finger, he will be out 4-6 weeks by initial reports.</p>
<p>The Celtics will continue to be without Marcus Smart for the road trip who is missing time due to, to steal a phrase from hockey, a &#8220;lower leg injury&#8221; which in medical terms is a subluxation of the proxmial tibfib joint. Ainge recently said on the Boston SportsHub 98.5 that he will likely be out a few more weeks but is working hard on getting back.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Boston they are a deep team with twelve players averaging over ten minutes per game so the rotation can pick up some slack however Smart&#8217;s spark, athleticism, defense and intensity are hard to match, the Celtics have gone 4-3 in his absence.</p>
<p>The Celtics got a much needed win in Mexico City as the next stretch of games are not any easier. They go on the road to play the new Twin Towers in LaMarcus Aldridge and Tim Duncan in San Antonio and then travel to New Orleans to do battle against Anthony Davis and the Pelicans. After that they will host Jimmy Butler and the Chicago Bulls before the reigning NBA Champion Golden State Warriors, led by MVP Stephen Curry, bring their currently undefeated, high tempo show to Boston next Friday night.</p>
<p>The Celtics will try to continue to grind through this difficult road trip while Sacramento is falling quickly out of contention in the breakneck paced race for the western conference playoffs.</p>
