He did it all without his number one wideout in Kelvin Benjamin, who will be ready to go for the 2016 campaign. Many think that Cam will regress back to the mean this year, as he won&#8217;t be forced to run as often with an improved offensive line and the return of some key contributors in the passing game. That being said, I&#8217;m of the belief that Cam is poised for another monster year in 2016. He made tremendous strides in term of accuracy and pocket presence last season, and at the ripe young age of 27, he still has room to grow in all aspects of his game. If Cam can continue to develop as a passer, use his legs when the opportunity presents itself, and avoid the kind of injuries that have thwarted his fantasy potential over the years, he should be an absolute stud once again in 2016.</p>
<p>2.) <strong>Aaron Rodgers</strong>&#8211; The longtime &#8220;King of Fantasy QB&#8217;s&#8221; was finally dethroned this past season, but that doesn&#8217;t mean he isn&#8217;t poised for another big year in 2016. Last year, Rodgers finished a disappointing 7th in QB rankings, (ESPN scoring) so conventional wisdom might suggest that he&#8217;s not the fantasy superstar we&#8217;ve grown accustomed to over the years. Well in the words of my guy Lee Corso &#8220;Not so fast my friends!&#8221;. Rodgers less-than-stellar numbers can be attributed to a number of factors, the least of which have to do with his play or ability. First off, his receiving corps were held together by glue and popsicle sticks, with Jordy Nelson out for the entire year and Randall Cobb battling a bevy of injuries over the course of the season. Secondly, Rodgers once stud RB1 Eddie Lacy took one too many trips to PF Chang&#8217;s last offseason and quickly became one big, fat punchline. Eddie Lacy wasn&#8217;t just football fat, he was &#8220;Jonah Hill pre-21 Jump Street fat&#8221;. Luckily for Rodgers, Nelson appears as though he&#8217;ll be ready to start the year and Lacy has popped in the &#8220;Kanye West get right for the summer workout tape&#8221; and has slimmed down considerably. Given those developments and the fact that Rodgers is still the most gifted thrower in the league, he should once again return to fantasy dominance in 2016.</p>
<p>3.) <strong>Tom Brady + Replacement Level QB-</strong> Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know that Tom is suspended for the first four games of the year for the horrendous acts he committed against humanity. I know that most quarterbacks would be at a tremendous disadvantage having missed the first four games of the season, and I know that it might take Tom and the boys a few weeks to truly get firing on all cylinders.  What I also know is that Tom Brady put together a stellar 2015 campaign that saw him finish 2nd among QB&#8217;s in points (ESPN scoring) and throw for the most touchdowns (36) and the least interceptions (7) among starting quarterbacks. He did all of this while missing his number one wide receiver in Julian Edelman for a majority of the season, as well as emerging pass-catching threat Dion Lewis. Consider these factors along with the common knowledge that Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all-time, and you can begin to see why I am so high on him despite his four game suspension. Brady will also benefit from the return of left tackle Nate Solder as well as offensive line coach Dante Scarnecchia, who should help to remedy the Patriots porous offensive line that allowed Brady to be sacked 38 times in 2015. When Brady does finally take the field, he will be more motivated than ever to prove that Deflategate was one giant hoax from the start, and that he and the Patriots are still the big, bad bullies on the block. Drafting a QB in the later rounds with a favorable schedule weeks 1-4 (something I will get into in my draft strategy column)  along with Brady could result in the highest scoring QB for you and your team in 2016. A pissed off Tom Brady offense will be running up the score every chance they get, and that will be sure to render big time fantasy numbers this coming season.</p>

<p>That being said, playoffs are never a given (unless your name is Tom Brady), and with that sentiment comes the inevitable questioning of offseason decisions. Time is the only way to tell whether or not the correct decision has been made, and as New England fans, we have been told to &#8220;trust in Belichick&#8221;. This is certainly an easy thing to do, as Belichick&#8217;s successes speak for themselves.</p>
<p>Belichick&#8217;s Patriots would not be the team to beat in the NFL if it were not for the team&#8217;s unquestioning work ethic and drive. Below are three players who have the most to prove this season on offense.</p>

With Dion Lewis and LaGarrette Blount out with season ending injuries the once dynamic combo of speed and power has been replaced by special team players and practice squad promotions. Jackson will add depth, experience, power running, ball security, and, for the Patriots, will hopefully transition to the offensive system quickly having played under offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels in 2011 in St. Louis.</p>
<p>With all the injuries the Pats have suffered Brandon Bolden, a key player in the special teams game who has always taken limited snaps at running back, has become the featured back in the New England offensive. He has been accompanied by the speedy James White who is able to play a vital role in the passing game. However with only two backs on the active roster New England was forced to promote a practice squad player for Sunday&#8217;s game against the Titans. Joey Iosefa, a 247-pound fullback who had been cut by Tampa Bay and later picked up by New England, made an impact with 51 yards on 14 carries and one big run in which he bulldozed Tennessee cornerback Coty Sensabaugh.</p>
<p>With New England so thin in the backfield, and with the playoffs and cold weather ahead, signing a veteran back like Steven Jackson looks like a solid move, although Jackson hasn&#8217;t played since being released by Atlanta in February. When in a Falcons uniform last season he averaged 3.7 yards per carry in 15 games. The three time Pro Bowler has churned out 11,388 yards over the course of 11 seasons in the NFL playing for Atlanta and St. Louis before that. Now at 32 years old the Patriots hope he has a little left in the tank to propel their running game forward. At 12-2 New England has secured a first round bye and has a great shot at the number one overall seed in the AFC. Over the next few weeks McDaniels and running back coaches will have the opportunity to work with Jackson and integrate him into the current carousel of backs.</p>
<p>If Jackson is able to get on the field quickly this would mean Bolden could get back to his special teams duties with limited touches at running back if needed. It would seem that the apparently explosive James White isn&#8217;t going anywhere as he has become a integral part of the Patriots offensive attack, particularly on passing downs. His combination of pass catching and ability to make plays when getting the ball in space gives back a little of the Dion Lewis dimension to the offensive.</p>
<p>The Patriots also recently signed running back Montee Ball to the practice squad, the Denver Broncos 2013 second round draft pick. Ball was productive in his rookie season with 120 carries for 559 yards and four touchdowns. In 2014 a groin injury sidelined him for much of the season before he was ultimately released.</p>
<p>If Jackson can get on the field this Sunday he will face a defense that is second in the NFL against the run for a better-than-expected Jets team currently fighting for a wild card spot.</p>

Since Bill Belichick has been the coach of the team they&#8217;ve only lost two games in a row 11 times, including Sunday&#8217;s game. It&#8217;s a luxury most teams in the NFL have not been afforded. When it happens in New England it&#8217;s easy to expect doom and gloom from all the talk shows because something must be wrong, right? The good news about Sunday&#8217;s game is that it can easily be chalked up to an anomaly.</p>
<p>&#8211; Let&#8217;s start off with that absolutely stupid fake, drop kick that they made Nate Ebner attempt. I definitely understand trying to practice these trick plays in real game scenarios which is why I was 100% in agreement with the onside kick against the Redskins. Obviously it&#8217;s easy to look at the onside kick against Washington with positive eyes since the play worked. Even if that play failed they were firing with a loaded gun on offense with Julian Edelman, Danny Amendola, Rob Gronkowski, and Dion Lewis all healthy and playing. If the onside kick fails and the Redskins score, the Patriots still had their full offense to gain the points back. On Sunday they were playing without Lewis, Edelman, Gronk, and Amendola has been hobbled with a bum knee. What is the point to trying that play in that situation? The only thing it did was anger the Eagles for &#8220;disrespecting&#8221; them and it gave life to a team that was down 14-0, on the road, and has already shown a track record for giving up in the middle of games. (...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/12/09/notes-and-observations-week-13-patriots-embarrass-themselves-at-home-lose-to-eagles-35-28/">Notes and Observations Week 13: Patriots Embarrass Themselves at Home, Lose to Eagles 35-28</a> (1,026 words)</p>

(AP Photo/Joe Mahoney)" ></a><p>Now that we&#8217;ve all had a full 24 hours to digest the frustrating monstrosity that was Sunday Night Football, we can rationally examine the remains. While it was fun to imagine this team really sticking it to the whole league and going 16-0 everyone knew just how hard that task would be. Every team in the league has to deal with injuries and atrocious officiating every single week, but Sunday night was the culmination of a season of that frustration for the previously undefeated Patriots. After losing key offensive weapons three consecutive weeks in Dion Lewis, Julian Edelman, and Danny Amendola, they narrowly escaped another major knee injury to Rob Gronkowski. The NFL referees have been astonishingly awful all season for every team but they really showed up to play for prime time. Unfortunately they were playing for the Broncos.</p>
<p>&#8211; It&#8217;s easy to write me off as biased and a homer for claiming the refs weren&#8217;t doing the Patriots any favors. However all it takes is a small semblance of a brain to realize the penalties called late in the game were a huge reason Sunday went the way it did. With just under 12 minutes to go in the third quarter and the Patriots up 21-14 Brady hit KeShawn Martin with a 51-yard bomb that was called back for holding on Tre Jackson. With just under five minutes to go in the game Brady hit Gronk on 3rd-and-5 for a 10-yard completion which was of course called back on Gronk&#8217;s fifth offensive pass interference call of the season. The holding on Jackson was borderline and the defender initiated the contact with Gronk, who never even extended his arm. (...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/12/01/notes-and-observations-week-12-patriots-lose-1st-game-in-frustrating-fashion-broncos-win-in-ot-30-24/">Notes and Observations Week 12: Patriots Lose 1st Game in Frustrating Fashion; Broncos Win in OT 30-24</a> (1,139 words)</p>

However Buffalo is reinvigorated with new head coach Rex Ryan, a rival to the establishment that is the Patriots in the AFC. The Bills have won their last two games against AFC East opponents and find themselves in the playoff hunt.</p>
<p>They come to New England on a chilly night with the forecast predicting temperatures dropping into the 20&#8217;s as the game gets underway. The cold weather is something the Bills have overcome in the past, being a cold weather team like New England, but one thing they have had trouble with is winning on Monday Night Football where they haven&#8217;t recorded a victory since 1999, Tom Brady&#8217;s senior year at Michigan.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/11/23/patriots-and-bills-set-to-do-battle-on-monday-night-football/">Patriots and Bills Set To Do Battle on Monday Night Football</a> (529 words)</p>

The Patriots ultimately defeated the Giants 27-26 on a last second, 54-yard field goal off the foot of Stephen Gostkowski. Tom Brady led the Pats into range by completing a 4th and 10 pass on their way down the field to victory.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Pats lost wide receiver Julian Edelman in the first half when it appeared he was rolled up on by Giants Linebacker Jasper Brinkley. Edelman limped off under his own power but tossed his helmet down when getting to the sidelines indicating that the injury may be more than just a tweaked ankle. He did not return to the game and afterwards was diagnosed with a broken foot, specifically a fracture of the fifth metatarsal bone in the mid-foot commonly known as the Jones fracture.</p>
<p>Fans may remember earlier this year when Dez Bryant suffered a similar injury, it does require surgery which Edelman underwent on Monday. Bryant was able to come back five weeks after going under the knife. Another Pro Bowl receiver, Julio Jones had the same injury and it took him a bit longer to recover. Like most foot problems if not given the proper time to heal they can lead to continued pain and possibly even recurrent fracture, but if anyone is likely to press getting back on the field it would be Julian Edelman. Not only is Edelman as tough as a bag of hammers, repeatedly taking big shots going over the middle and as a return man, but he is also a fierce competitor who wears his emotions on his sleeve.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/11/16/julian-edelman-breaks-foot-return-this-season-questionable/">Julian Edelman Breaks Foot, Return This Season Questionable</a> (394 words)</p>

This week was another prime example of just how good we have it here. The Patriots handled the Redskins all game and the win was never in doubt. Tom Brady finished just one yard shy of 300 for the day and threw for two more touchdowns. The defense played as good as they have been the past few weeks. Even with all that it was a bad game by Patriots&#8217; standards.</p>
<p>&#8211; Tom Brady put up another solid performance with 299 yards, going 26-39 with two touchdowns. He had a very uncharacteristic interception that made me do a double take to make sure it was Brady throwing the ball. It was a rare instance where he didn&#8217;t read the defense correctly and just never saw linebacker Keenan Robinson playing zone. Credit to Robinson for reading the play and making the interception, but that was a bad pass by Brady. Again, that&#8217;s how great it is to be a Patriots fan. These awful plays are so few and far between that it&#8217;s actually shocking when it happens.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/11/11/notes-and-observations-week-9-patriots-beat-redskins-27-10-to-go-8-0-for-2nd-time-in-team-history/">Notes and Observations, Week 9: Patriots Beat Redskins 27-10 to go 8-0 for 2nd Time in Team History</a> (929 words)</p>

Lewis, who had been a major contributor out of the backfield for the Patriots, will undergo surgery with the goal of being ready for the start of next season.</p>
<p>Throughout the Bill Belichick/ Tom Brady run in New England, the Patriots have always had a shifty pass catching running back who can make key plays in the passing game. First it was Kevin Faulk and then Shane Vereen. With Vereen&#8217;s departure this past offseason, the team looked to fill that hole and had Lewis competing with James White for reps. Lewis won the competition and quickly established himself as an important component of New England&#8217;s offense. His ability to break tackles and maneuver through crowded areas made him very difficult to match-up with. On several occasions, Brady would target Lewis over Rob Gronkowski or Julian Edelman based on favorable match-ups.</p>
<p>This is not to say that losing Lewis is on the same level as losing Gronkowksi or Edelman, but he proved to be much more than just a safety valve out of the backfield and he will be missed. James White and Brandon Bolden will need to step up in order to shoulder the load left by Lewis. Bolden filled in admirably against Washington, but he does not have the speed or shiftiness of Lewis and White has had trouble cracking the lineup in recent weeks.</p>
<p>With Lewis out, the Patriots will need to hope either Bolden or White can fill his role. It can&#8217;t be expected for either one of them to play at Lewis&#8217; level, but they will need to produce. If they cannot, the Patriots offense will have more difficulty moving the ball.</p>

(AP Photo/Michael Dwyer)" ></a><p>One of the best things about being a Patriots fan is having this luxury of knowing you&#8217;re going to the playoffs every year. Even more than that, you&#8217;re probably going to watch your team in the AFC Championship just like the past four years. In only week eight, the Patriots have basically wrapped up the AFC East. After emasculating the Dolphins on Thursday night they now have wins against each of their AFC East opponents. What&#8217;s more impressive is that score could have been a lot worse. The offense left a lot of first half points on the field as the defense was shutting the Dolphins down. That&#8217;s really nitpicking though as 36 points is nothing to bat an eye at.</p>
<p>&#8211; I genuinely hope everyone watching is really appreciating what Tom Brady is doing this season. What he&#8217;s doing at 38 years old is nothing short of amazing. On Thursday he went 26-38 for 356 yards, with four touchdowns and no interceptions. That brings his totals on the year to 2,410 yards with 20 touchdowns and only one interception that came off a bobbled pass from Julian Edelman. He&#8217;s on pace to throw over 5,500 yards, about 47 touchdowns, and maybe have three interceptions. He&#8217;s more focused than he&#8217;s ever been and it was never more apparent than on one play in the fourth quarter. With the game already in hand with a score of 29-7, Brady took a sack after missing a read. He then slammed the ball and his fist in frustration. Even though the game was already over Brady wasn&#8217;t satisfied. He wants to leave no points on the field. Tom Brady wants to win this season more than he wants anything in the world and I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anyone out there who can slow him down. (...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/11/02/notes-and-observations-week-8-patriots-virtually-clinch-afc-east-in-36-7-win-over-dolphins/">Notes and Observations, Week 8: Patriots Virtually Clinch AFC East in 36-7 Win Over Dolphins</a> (1,046 words)</p>
