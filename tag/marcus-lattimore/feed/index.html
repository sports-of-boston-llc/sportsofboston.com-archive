(Associated Press)" ></a><p>Were now through four weeks of college football and this is about the time we start to see players solidify their position as a Heisman candidate. Once again I have reshuffled my Heisman standings, this time due to a loss. Remember it&#8217;s not just about individual statistics, but how your team performs during the year.</p>
<p>With that said here is our week four Heisman standings.</p>
<p><strong>1. Marcus Lattimore, RB, South Carolina</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Stat Line</span>: 20 carries, 150 total yards, 2 total TD<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Season</span>: 107 carries, 611 yards, 8 TD</p>
<p>Lattimore did not have his best day rushing, but nonetheless he was still able to total 150 yards and two touchdowns. Lattimore struggled to find running room all day against Vanderbilt, averaging 3.9 yards-per-carry. Where Lattimore was able to hurt the Commodores was in the receiving game. Lattimore caught three balls for 73 yards and a touchdown.</p>
<p>One of those receptions was a 52-yard catch that put South Carolina up 14-3 &#8212; putting the game out of reach. Lattimore is now second in the country in rushing, but due to the fact that he gets so many carries he is a good bet to finish the season leading the nation in rushing.</p>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Season</span>: 50 carries, 288 yards, 4 TD&#8217;s</p>
<p>I had Lattimore ranked fifth last week after he had three rushing touchdowns against East Carolina. The only reason I had him ranked is because I believe he is the best running back in the country. This week Lattimore solidified his place on this list by single handily carrying the Gamecocks to a victory against a desperate Georgia team. Lattimore averaged 6.5 yards-per-carry on his way to rushing for 176 yards and South Carolina would need every yard. Stephen Garica really struggled throwing for just 142 yards and two interceptions. Lattimore put South Carolina up 38-35 late in the fourth a lead they would not give back. South Carolina plays Navy next.</p>

With all that said it is time to take a look at our Heisman rankings after week one of the college football season.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Landry Jones, QB Oklahoma</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Stat Line</span>: 35-47, 375 yards, 1 TD</p>
<p>Landry Jones connected on 74.5 percent of his passes as the Sooners cruised by Tulsa 47-14. Jones came into the season as my preseason pick to win the Heisman. This is his third season under center and last season Jones passed for 4,718 yards and 38 touchdowns. After week one all signs point to Jones putting up similar if not better numbers than last year. Up next for Jones is a trip to Florida State on Sept. 17.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Kellen Moore, QB Boise State</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Stat Line</span>: 28-34, 261 yards, 3 TDs</p>
<p>Kellen Moore once again shined in a big game. He picked apart Georgia&#8217;s defense to the tune of 261 yards and three touchdowns. A lot of questions were surrounding how Moore would play now that Titus Young and Austin Pettis moved on to the NFL. Moore put all those questions to rest as he connected with nine different receivers. You have to believe that Moore has a very good chance of winning the Heisman now that Boise beat Georgia. The Broncos will likely run the table setting Moore up for a return trip to New York City. Next game at Toledo.</p>
