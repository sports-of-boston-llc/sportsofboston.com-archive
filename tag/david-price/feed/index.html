Andrew Miller was a huge factor coming out of the bullpen this series, most of the time leaving The Sox batters swinging at air.  Ben Cherington is the vice president of baseball operations in Toronto.  So basically, Francona and Miller are playing against Cherington, winner plays Theo Epstein and Jon Lester in the World Series.  Jeesh, imagine having all these guys in the same organization.  Oh wait they were, and the ownership screwed it up.</p>
<p>Dave Dombrowski doesn&#8217;t get a pass on this season either.  Aaron Hill, Fernando Abad, Brad Ziegler, and Drew Pomeranz were Dombrowski&#8217;s moves at the deadline.  These guys were a non factor, except for Pomeranz who gave up a 2 run BOMB to Coco Crisp, essentially losing the game.  How about David Price&#8217;s deal?  He got a 7 year, $217 million dollar deal from Dombroski, a deal that will ultimately end up being a failure, if it&#8217;s not already.  For a guy that was supposed to come in and turn things around, Dombrowski has been a letdown as president of baseball operations thus far.</p>
<p>Winning the series at Fenway last night meant a lot to Terry Francona, you could tell by the way he was reacting on the field.  He knows when he was fired that ownership was stirring up rumors about him, and last night he left with the last laugh.  I&#8217;m sure Jon Lester was laughing somewhere too, remember that horrible offer The Sox gave him?  4 years for $70 million?  Then they turn around and give Price 7 years for $217 million, what a joke.  You know what you had in Lester, he could handle the Boston spotlight and he could win in the playoffs.  Two things that David Price can not do.</p>
<p>This team needs a shake up and ownership has to provide it, and as of now it seems like it&#8217;s not going to happen.  Dombrowski just announced Farrell will be back next season.</p>
<p>Ortiz retired and Farrell coming back.  Just doesn&#8217;t seem right.</p>

<p>The Red Sox should have won this series pretty easily, but now?  The Yankees are only 3 games back of The Sox in the standings.  The Yankees are not a good team.  They unloaded at the trade deadline by trading, Andrew Miller, Aroldis Chapman, and Carlos Beltran.  New York pretty much waved the white flag at the deadline, and now they have hope.  I&#8217;m not saying The Yankees are a threat in the division or the wild card.  The point is these are the games you have to win when you&#8217;re fighting for a playoff spot.</p>
<p>The Red Sox had a lead going into the 7th inning in all 3 games of the series.  They lost two of those games.  The one game they did win, they walked the bases loaded in the ninth.  This Red Sox bullpen is putrid.  It seems like they can&#8217;t get anyone out, especially when there are guys on base.  It seems like this pitching staff has no guts.  They can&#8217;t get the big strikeout when the pressures on, it seems like they get tight and timid.</p>
<p>This series wasn&#8217;t all the pitching staffs fault.  What happen to the offense?  Just about a month ago they were crushing the baseball.  Now?  They have 2 hits in their last 29 attempts with the bases loaded.  This offense is much to talented to go into slumps like this.  Speaking of slumps, why does it seem the whole team goes in one giant slump at the same time?  It seems like this team is lacking confidence right now.  They could really use a benches clearing brawl to wake them up, or you know they could fire the manager.</p>
<p>They start a 3 game series with Arizona tonight, it&#8217;s safe to say sweeping The Diamondbacks is a must.  Especially with the tough road games on the horizon.</p>

The Sox acquired left handed reliever Fernando Abad from the Minnesota Twins in exchange for minor league lefty Pat Light.</p>
<p>Abad will help the Sox&#8217;s struggling bullpen as left handed hitters have only a .163 batting average off him this season. This is not a big trade but will definitely aid the Sox a little with their pitching situation. But the move that everyone was hoping for was to see another stud pitcher in the starting rotation.</p>
<p>Everyone knows Chris Sale was the talk of the deadline but it was no surprise to me that he stayed with Chicago. A dominant pitcher like him is not going to go anywhere without a very large trade being put in place. It&#8217;s a shame the Sox couldn&#8217;t snag him because he is just what we are missing.</p>
<p>However, I have to say I am very surprised Andrew Benintendi and Joan Moncada stayed with the AA Portland Sea Dogs. I expected the Sox to move at least one of them in a trade to acquire a starting pitcher. Now that they are staying in the Sox farm system, I don&#8217;t know what the Sox are going to do with their starting rotation.</p>
<p>The addition of Drew Pomeranz was viewed as a good move at first but is looking a little shaky right now. Steven Wright has had a couple bad starts lately and David Price is still yet to get into a consistent groove. The only consistent pitcher the Sox have right now is Rick Porcello who quietly has been a stud this year with a 14-2 record.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what the Sox are going to do but if they want to be serious contenders for the playoffs, their pitching has to make some adjustments. The AL East and the American League in general is very competitive right now and it&#8217;s really a toss up for which teams are going to win the division and the wild card.</p>
<p>Safe to say this trade deadline helped, but it wasn&#8217;t enough.</p>

<p>I truly don&#8217;t understand why people are hesitant to give up young prospects like, Moncada, or Benintendi, for a STUD like Sale.  Especially with this being Ortiz last season, I feel like you have to go all in and try to win now.  With Betts, Bradley, and Bogaerts there&#8217;s already a young nucleus in place, and it&#8217;s not like The Sox are an old team.  The way David Price has been pitching this season might also push Dombrowski to make a move for Sale.  Price hasn&#8217;t exactly pitched like an ace this season, so the opportunity to get one at the trade deadline could put The Sox over the top.</p>
<p>When The Sox included Hanley Ramirez in the deal for Mike Lowell, and Josh Beckett people in Boston were not happy.  Hanley went on to be one of the best players in the league for a stretch of time.  How did The Red Sox do after that?  They won a world series, and Hanley was long forgotten.  The point is if you have a chance to win A World Series you do it.  Their will always be another 18 year old prospect, their will never be another David Ortiz, do right by him and go all in for Sale.</p>

Coming out of the break, Sox fans (including myself) were hopeful that David Price had figured out the source of his struggles throughout the first half of the year. Unfortunately, it was much of the same for Price and the Sox last night in the Bronx.</p>
<p>Like so many times this season, the big lefty looked sharp in the opening frames. His velocity was excellent, painting the black with a fastball touching 96 mph early and often. That, combined with his ability to mix in his breaking ball saw Price making quick work of the Yankees 19th ranked lineup through the first three innings. But, much like it has SO many times this season, one big inning ultimately did in the Red Sox &#8220;ace&#8221;.</p>
<p>So often this year, Price&#8217;s nemesis has been the long ball. While he didn&#8217;t allow a yabo last night, (a small miracle) he did surrender five hits in the fourth inning that resulted in three Yankee runs. Combine that with an excellent performance from Tanaka and the great Yankee bullpen, and that was all she wrote for the Sox and their six game winning streak.</p>
<p>Watching a pitcher with Price&#8217;s track record and ability struggle so mightily this season has been nothing short of perplexing. Mowing down lineups for years with the Rays, Jays, and Tigers, no one could have envisioned him sitting on an ERA of 4.36 twenty starts into his Red Sox career. Here&#8217;s hoping he can right the ship before the Sox and their playoff hopes disappear in the heat of the summer.</p>

<p>You can make the case that Porcello has been the Red Sox best pitcher so far this season.  He has a record of 11-2, his ERA is 3.66, and he has a WHIP of only 1.17.  These are stats that are much improved from his horrible campaign from last season, to make it worse he signed that 4 year contract worth 82.5 million dollars.  Last season it seemed like Porcello really couldn&#8217;t get a grip of the season, and really couldn&#8217;t figure out Boston.  Maybe that big contract got to his head?  If I had to guess I&#8217;d say yes it did.</p>
<p>This season tho he has been the most consistent pitcher The Sox have.  He has been able to get the tough outs when needed, and has pitched in some really big games this season.  Porcello shows no signs of slowing down, I totally expect him to continue his dominance post all-star break.  Porcello seems like he has more &#8216;guts&#8217; than the other guys on the staff.  With that being said, if the season comes down to one game it should be Porcello on the mound, not David Price.</p>

<p>If the Red Sox are going to make a legit run this season there is a few things they have to do.  First is firing the manager.  This recent bad play isn&#8217;t all Farrell&#8217;s fault you can also blame the players, but yet you can&#8217;t just fire the players.  David Price has a 10.38 era in his last 2 starts, and is having the worst season of his career.  Stephen Wright has also been less than stellar in his last 2 starts, posting an era of 6.52.  The players aren&#8217;t performing the way they should be and it&#8217;s time to give this team a wake up call.  I&#8217;d hate to see someone lose their job over other people&#8217;s performance, however it&#8217;s the only way to save this season.</p>

During that span, the Orioles have opened a 5.5 game lead over the once first place Boston Red Sox, and the Blue Jays have suddenly found an identity (and are currently tied with the Sox for second place). Obviously, this does not bode well for Boston, and the excitement at the beginning of the season is now slowly being replaced with a feeling of dread.</p>
<p>One bit of good news for the Red Sox is that they are tied for first place in the AL Wild Card race. The Royals and Astros are both only a half game behind, however.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to July, the Sox will kick off the month by taking on the Angels in Boston for a three game set, followed by a four game series against the Rangers. The Red Sox will look to build momentum against a sinking Los Angeles team before doing battle against Texas.</p>
<p>At the moment, the LA Angels sit at 32-47, and are in last place in the AL West. This is a series the Red Sox will be looking to sweep, and hopefully gain some ground on both the Wild Card race and the AL East race.</p>
<p>To finish out the month, the Red Sox will play Tampa Bay (at home, 3 games), the Yankees (away, 3 games), San Francisco (home, 2 games), Minnesota (home, 4 games), Detroit (home, 3 games) and the Angels again (away, 4 games).</p>
<p>The Red Sox will willingly accept a seemingly easier month, as they play four teams that currently sit at .500 or below.</p>
<p>Dave Dombrowski is expected to be active at the trade deadline, and will hopefully acquire starting pitching that will propel the Red Sox to the postseason, one way or another. Price, who has had nothing short of a roller-coaster of a season thus far, has stated to the media that he knows he can play at a higher level, and most expect him to rebound in a good way in the second half of the season.</p>
<p>If the Red Sox can figure out starting pitching, and can come away with a good record in the month of July, they should once again find themselves near the top of their division. Keep in mind that the Red Sox still lead the majors in runs scored (434), batting average (.286), and on-base percentage (.354). They also have several players who are leading in All-Star polling at their respective positions (Ortiz, Bogaerts, JBJ, and Betts). This team can rebound, and quickly. It is not yet time to panic in Boston, but it is a good time to remember how long the Major League Baseball season is.</p>

It might be easy to say that it&#8217;s not surprising that Buchholz struggled against a Rangers team with the best record in the American League, especially with how Buchholz&#8217;s season has gone this year. But John Farrell used his faith in Buchholz to justify not bringing up a reliever from Pawtucket a night after <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8185&amp;position=P">Steven Wright</a> did not make it out of the fifth inning, and two nights after <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=3184&amp;position=P">David Price</a> didn&#8217;t make it out of the third. Most Red Sox fans already knew that faith was misguided, and were not surprised when Buchholz allowed the first six batters he faced to reach base, putting giving the Rangers an immediate lead they would not give up. Buchholz also walked more batters (5) than he struck out (3), further illustrating why he was demoted to the bullpen earlier in the season. Sadly the Red Sox find themselves thin on options as far as starting pitching is concerned, but there really is no reason to send Buchholz back out for another start. He has had more than his fair share of chances in Boston, and he has proven that the only thing he can be counted on to do is under-perform.</p>
<p>A few more notes from Sunday&#8217;s game:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=10607&amp;position=OF">Bryce Brentz</a> went 2-for-3 with a solo homer, the first of his Major League career. It will be interesting to see if the Red Sox try to get Brentz some playing time in Left Field going forward, as his bat could be starting to heat up. His main competition in Left, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=10700&amp;position=OF">Ryan LaMarre</a>, has done absolutely nothing with the bat since coming up from Pawtucket, so there should be plenty of playing time available for whoever is performing at the moment.</li>

The heralded ace David Price has been good this season with a 7-3 record and 91 strikeouts, but his 4.63 ERA leaves plenty of room for improvement. Then there is Steven Wright, who has unexpectedly taken over the second spot in the rotation through his stellar consistency. The knuckle ball profile fits more in the middle to back end of a pitching staff, but Wright&#8217;s impressive performance and lack of a viable alternative have propelled him to the front in the rotation.</p>
<p>Rick Porcello follows Wright in the rotation. The twenty-seven year old had an exciting start to the season but has since seen his ERA creep over four in June, which lends itself to some concerns. The return of Eduardo Rodriguez is a welcome addition and can help boost the rotation if he performs, but doubts about the overall quality and depth of the pitching staff are imminent.</p>
<p>After Price there are some critical questions that need to be addressed, and it begins with Steven Wright. Is he really a top two starter for a potential division winner? There is no doubt he has been outstanding this year, the most consistent pitcher on the team, but the unreliable nature of the knuckleball is a tad concerning. It would behoove the Red Sox to see an emergence from either Porcello or Rodriguez as consistent performance from one of these two traditional pitchers would help stabilize the top of the rotation and ease any excessive expectations of Steven Wright.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with the rotation is the vacancy left by disastrous seasons from both Clay Buchholz and Joe Kelly. Buchholz has the potential to rebound from his demotion to the bullpen if he can find his command, but Kelly on the other hand is a lost cause. Even worse, in his last start with Pawtucket Kelly left the game after four and two thirds innings with an apparent groin injury.</p>
<p>Thanks to the friendly nature of the Red Sox schedule until mid June, John Farrell announced that he will employ a four man rotation until June 18th. At that point he wants someone to grab the role of fifth starter and demand that spot through their performance. This offers an opportunity not only to the incumbents Buchholz and Kelly, but also Henry Owens and Roenis Elias whom have both spent most of the season in Pawtucket.</p>
<p>If these problems with the pitching staff are not addressed from within the organization the front office will have to make a trade. This is potentially problematic because the market for quality pitching at this season&#8217;s trade deadline appears minimal. The two top options are Sonny Gray of the Oakland Athletics and the Atlanta Braves&#8217; Julio Teheran, both of whom will demand a healthy package of top prospects in return.</p>
<p>In an ideal world the team will find a resolution from within the organization, but earlier this week Dave Dombrowski announced he is looking for both starting and relief pitching help before the August 1st deadline. It remains to be seen how the situation will unfold, but pitching is a key element of success for any baseball team and Red Sox could use some help both in rotation and the bullpen as they prepare for a pennant race and playoff run.</p>
