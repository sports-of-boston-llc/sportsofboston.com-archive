(Kyle Terada/US Presswire)" ></a><p>Already equipped with one of the NFL&#8217;s best offenses, Bill Belichick and co. may look to add even more fire power at wide receiver.</p>
<p>According to Aaron Wilson, of Scout.com, Mark Clayton will be in town Friday for a work out. Clayton, 29, was the 22nd pick in the 2005 NFL Draft, and it was widely considered at the time that New England was interested in the Oklahoma wide out then.</p>
<p>In five season with the Ravens, Clayton caught 234 passes for 3,116 yards and 12 touchdowns before being traded to the St. Louis Rams for a late-round draft choice last September. Clayton played in just five games (23 rec., 306 yds., 2 TDs) until he tore his patella tendon in his right knee.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Patriots also worked out Clayton&#8217;s former teammate T.J. Houshmandzadeh. This could be nothing more than the Patriots exhausting the possibilities of a veteran wide receiver. With Chad Ochocinco, Deion Branch and Wes Welker providing the leadership experience at receiver, Julian Edelman and Taylor Price could round out the depth chart &#8212; leaving the oft-injured Brandon Tate standing on the outside.</p>
<p>Either Houshmandzadeh or Clayton would provide yet another option for No. 12.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With Week 1 of the NFL in the books, you and your fantasy team are in one of two situations. Situation #1: you won your first week’s match-up and you’ve got visions of fantasy football glory running through your head, all the way to your league’s championship. Situation #2: you’ve got Kevin Kolb and Ryan Grant, and you’re already swapping players for draft picks for next season, giving up all hope on a lost fantasy season.</p>
<p>Well relax all of you, whether you’re riding high or you’re down in the dumps. Fantasy football championships aren’t won or lost in the first week of the season. It’s how you follow it up in the next few weeks that can make or break your team and your chances. So Joe Fantasy, who spent all week weeping in misery because he lost Ryan Grant, his top RB, to injury and didn’t win the waiver claim for Brandon Jackson, cheer up pal. Turn over a new leaf, it’s Week 2, and hope springs eternal.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/09/17/fantasy-fast-forward-nfl-week-2/">Fantasy Fast Forward: NFL Week 2</a> (2,768 words)</p>

<p>If you told me Tom Brady had 42 attempts in a game, I&#8217;d tell you he easily threw for over 300 yards. And if you then told me he threw for 200 yards, I&#8217;d be surprised.  But 154 yards? On 42 attempts? You&#8217;re kidding, right? No, unfortunately not. This is what happened on Sunday in Foxboro, and even those fans freezing their tails off at Gillette Stadium couldn&#8217;t believe their eyes.</p>
<p>For those of you still reading, I must warn you, it gets worse. Not only did Tom Brady manage only 154 yards on 42 attempts in Sunday&#8217;s Wildcard playoff game, he threw three interceptions! One interception can usually be overcome, two interceptions hurt, but three interceptions are almost always fatal for a football team.</p>
<p>Brady finished the day 23/42 and threw two touchdowns to go along with his three picks. His quarterback rating was 49.1.</p>
<p>In his defense, Brady was allegedly playing with a broken finger and three broken ribs, and without his favorite target Wes Welker. He was clearly not 100 percent against the Ravens, and the beating he took against the Texans a week earlier probably contributed to his skittish play on Sunday. The Patriots All-Pro quarterback wasn&#8217;t putting enough zip on his passes, and his accuracy was very poor.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen Brady throw so many wounded-duck passes. Any questions surrounding the effect of Brady&#8217;s injuries on his play can be answered by the fact that he didn&#8217;t throw deep to Randy Moss once. His inability to throw deep also contributed to his 3.7 yards per completion average.</p>
<p>The Raven&#8217;s defense also deserves a lot of credit for Brady&#8217;s poor performance. They didn&#8217;t try to confuse Brady like so many defenses have failed to do in the past. Instead they blitzed him into oblivion. Dwan Edwards, Ray Lewis, and Terrell Suggs all managed to sack Brady, but Suggs&#8217; first quarter strip sack was the most damaging. It set up Le&#8217;Ron McClain&#8217;s one yard touchdown run putting the Ravens up 14-0.</p>
<p>With his team trailing 24-7 at halftime, the wounded Brady was forced to try to throw his team to a comeback victory. The Raven&#8217;s defense, knowing the Patriots would abandon the run, blanketed the Patriot&#8217;s wide receivers picking off Brady three times. It was just too tall of an order for an injured Brady, without his favorite target, to lead his team back from such a large deficit. Even still, Brady managed to throw two touchdowns to Julian Edelman, keeping the Patriots on life support into the fourth quarter.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>They worked all season to get to this point. Now, the New England Patriots will have to best a perennial defensive power house in the Baltimore Ravens. It is one of the four rematches from the regular season being played this weekend. The Patriots will hope for a repeat of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/10/04/patriots-outlast-ravens-27-21/">the 27-21 win during Week 4</a>.  Since then, the Ravens have been playing stellar football and hope to spoil New England&#8217;s future playoff plans.</p>
<h2>HOW THEY GOT HERE:</h2>
<p>New England has had a roller coaster season. Half of New England&#8217;s games this season have been decided by a touchdown, including five of their losses. However, they persevered and outlasted the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets to capture the AFC East. Last season, they were 11-5 and missed the playoffs. This season, 10-6 was enough to win the division and earn a home playoff game. The Patriots now welcome the Ravens to Foxboro, a team they are 5-0 against all time.</p>
<p>Baltimore surprised the world last season when they went all the way to the AFC Championship, led by a rookie coach (John Harbaugh) and quarterback (Joe Flacco). They wasted little time this year, starting 3-0 until they ran into the Patriots. Their schedule was a mix of top teams (Colts and Vikings) and bottom dwellers (Browns and Lions), and they finished with a 9-7 record, second in their division to the Bengals. As a wild card team last season, they had no struggles on the road and they are looking to repeat in the new decade.</p>
<h2>WHY NEW ENGLAND WILL WIN:</h2>
<p>There are certain teams that New England does not lose to and one of them is the Ravens. Since the Browns became the Ravens in 1996, the Patriots have gone 5-0 against the birds. However, this will be a first-time matchup in the playoffs. Still, how much of a difference will this game be from the Week 4 tilt? In that matchup, Mark Clayton dropped a would-be first down pass that would have kept a potential game-winning drive alive for the Ravens. It was a game New England should have lost, (their top receiver was Ben Watson with 51 yards and they had no rusher over 25 yards), but in the end, they prevailed. In the end, it&#8217;s not how you win, but that you win.</p>
<p>So, the simple fact that New England has Tom Brady at the helm should be enough. Even <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/01/09/the-playoffs-without-wes-welker/">with Wes Welker down</a>, Brady&#8217;s weapons of Randy Moss, Ben Watson, Julian Edelman, and Kevin Faulk will allow him to spread the ball around and keep New England rolling.</p>
<p>This game also sees the return of Vince Wilfork. The big man on defense will eliminate any holes for Baltimore&#8217;s Ray Rice or Willis McGahee. The Ravens runners are north-to-south guys who run right down the middle and by shutting them down, New England will ruin Baltimore&#8217;s offense. With a quarterback who can control the clock and a defense that can make the other team continue to punt, there is no doubt that the Patriots will win the game.</p>
<h2>WHY BALTIMORE WILL WIN:</h2>
<p>New England might have been team of the decade, but Baltimore was the defense of the decade. They have had the most feared linebacker in recent memory, Ray Lewis. Their secondary is manned by Ed Reed, a man who has a better nose for the ball than most receivers. So, there is a reason why they should be angry. The only talk about defense is how the New York Jets have the best in the league, by far. If that isn&#8217;t enough to get a team fired up, then nothing is. The Ravens have six guys who have two or more interceptions on the season. Ray Lewis is fifth in the league in tackles and leads a pass rush that has collected 32 sacks on the season.</p>
<p>On the other side of the ball, the Ravens have a duel run threat with Ray Rice and Willis McGahee and a quarterback that doesn&#8217;t make many mistakes. No experts out of Baltimore are picking the Ravens to win, which does create an &#8220;us against the world&#8221; mentality. This game will be a statement game for the Ravens, proving they still have a great defense and that last season&#8217;s AFC Championship appearance was no fluke.</p>
<h2>THE X-FACTOR:</h2>
<p>Who will win the wide receiver battle? Derrick Mason was the Ravens leader in receiving yards with 1,028, but Ray Rice was first in receptions with 78 and the team&#8217;s second leading receiver. Todd Heap, Mark Clayton and Kelley Washington have not been the models of perfection. They also are not sure things for Joe Flacco. If New England shuts the running game down, every member of the Ravens receiving corp will have to step up their game, or they will have an early exit from the playoffs.</p>
<p>When you talk about receivers in New England, all talk goes to the loss of Wes Welker. He is done for a while and Randy Moss appears to be injured as well. That leaves Ben Watson as the teams next leading receiver with 404 yards. Moss will be active for the team and hopefully his injury is one of Bill Belichick&#8217;s mind tricks. Edelman and Sam Aiken will see a lot of playing time and Kevin Faulk will see many passes going his way when he&#8217;s in the game.</p>
<p>Not-So-Fun-Fact: Super Bowl XLII hero David Tyree, yes the &#8220;helmet catch guy,&#8221; now plays for the Ravens and is fourth on their depth chart. Do not be surprised if he makes an appearance, if only to be used as a distraction.</p>
<h2>PREDICTION:</h2>
<p>This could be the closest game played during Wild Card Weekend. If New England can not control the Ravens run game, there is no chance they will win. The last time around, the Patriots did not allow a rushing touchdown. If they can repeat that success, then New England advancing in the playoffs is a sure thing. The loss of Wes Welker will be felt this week, but if there was one person who could over come that obstacle, it&#8217;s Tom Brady. The Ravens will throw everything, including the kitchen sink, at the Patriots, but trust in Belichick. He lives for these games. <strong>Patriots 27 &#8211; Ravens 20</strong>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Baltimore Ravens (3-0) at New England Patriots (2-1)</h2>
<p><strong>Time</strong>: 1:00 p.m.<br />
<strong>Where</strong>: Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Massachusetts<br />
<strong>TV</strong>: CBS<br />
<strong>Radio</strong>: 98.5 FM:  The Sports Hub</p>
<p>The New England Patriots are entering Week 4 with a respectable 2-1 record and are gearing up to play one of the most potent offenses in the NFL&#8230;wait&#8230;the Baltimore Ravens?</p>
<p>No longer just a defensive team, the Ravens have finally added an offense that makes them a serious Super Bowl contender.  They have maturity on both sides of the ball and are 11-1 in their last 12 games, including the preseason.  Since becoming the Ravens (remember they were once the original Cleveland Browns), the franchise is winless against the Patriots and has scored a combined six points at games in New England.  To quote the Ravens, they hope this happens &#8220;Never More.&#8221;(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/10/04/patriots-meet-new-and-improved-ravens-offense/">Patriots Meet New And Improved Ravens Offense</a> (1,479 words)</p>
