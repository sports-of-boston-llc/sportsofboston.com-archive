(boston.com)" ></a><p>Sophomore RB Josh Haden and Redshirt Freshman QB Justin Tuggle have both decided to transfer from Boston College today. Both have seen less and less playing time as the year has gone on.</p>
<h3>Justin Tuggle lost the starting QB job and apparently fell to at least third on the depth chart</h3>
<p>Although never said it out loud, the Tuggle transfer seemed imminent with him sitting third on the depth chart recently after starting the first three games. Tuggle’s athleticism was his greatest asset at QB, but he was never accurate and had a tendency to heave down field jump balls even when no one was open. In his first two games against Kent State and Northeastern, he threw for 206 yards and three touchdowns, but against Clemson he fell apart on a dismal 4-20 outing with three interceptions. When true Freshman Mike Marscovetra came in to replace a struggling Dave Shinskie against Virginia Tech instead of Tuggle, it looked like Tuggle’s window of opportunity at BC shut. Even after a rough performance by Shinskie against a weak Notre Dame defense, Tuggle was no longer confident in his chances to succeed at Boston College. Highly touted incoming QB Chase Rettig would have put Tuggle in an even further hole next year if he stayed.</p>
<h3>Montel Harris&#8217; stellar play earning him most of the touches</h3>
<p>What caused more of a stir was the move of Haden from Chestnut Hill. After coming in as the key recruit of the Jeff Jagodzinski era (spurning offers from Florida, Michigan, and Ohio State), Jagodzinski handed Haden the starting spot as a true freshman. Jags believed Haden fit the mold of a fast pass catching tailback perfectly, which fit into then offensive coordinator Steve Logan’s spread offense. Lightly recruited and ex-Duke commit Montel Harris quickly earned a spot in the rotation and ended up gaining 421 more yards on 59 more carries. He had more receiving yards. The duo ended up second in the nation for freshman running back tandem and carried that chemistry into this year with Montel Harris changing his number from 42 to 2 to literally become a 1-2 tandem with Haden.</p>
<p>Harris ran wild this season (with the exception of the Wake Forest game) and, after dominating the Florida State game, never looked back. Haden is currently averaging 1.4 yards less per carry than Haden and 1.1 yards less than promising true freshman Rolandan Finch. His tendency to dance in the backfield and inability to break tackles has greatly hampered his play. Josh Haden’s brother Joe currently plays on the Florida Gators and is one of the top corners in the nation.</p>
<p>Head Coach Frank Spaziani wished both players well.</p>

(AP Photo/Mary Schwalm)" ></a><p>Welcome to another installment of my observations of the BC Eagles football team this past weekend.</p>
<h3>The Eagles running attack looked weak</h3>
<p>RBs Montel Harris and Josh Haden combined for twenty-seven carries and ninety-eight yards. The offensive line never got a push of the line of scrimmage even though RT Rich Lapham came back from a neck injury that kept him out of the Northeastern game. I understand that Kent State DTs Aaron Hull and Sam Frist are some of the better MAC players, but this is unacceptable for one of the better offensive lines in the ACC. If Boston College has any chance against an impressive Clemson team, it needs the running game to set up the passing game in a hostile Death Valley.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/09/15/five-eagle-thoughts-for-week-2/">Five Eagle Thoughts for Week 2</a> (381 words)</p>
