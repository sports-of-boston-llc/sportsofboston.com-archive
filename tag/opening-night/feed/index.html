Most of it has revolved around <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/04/05/video-5-year-old-kid-gives-miracle-speech-at-fenway-park/">five-year-old Joshua Sacco and his recitation of Herb Brooks&#8217; speech from the movie &#8220;Miracle.&#8221;</a> More specifically, the part where Brooks says &#8220;I&#8217;m so sick of hearing about what a great [hockey, replaced with baseball] team the [Russians, replaced with Yankees] have. Screw em!&#8221; But a far more meaningful moment came via the ceremonial first pitch. From behind an American flag, and walking on to the song &#8220;In the Air Tonight&#8221; by Phil Collins, emerged former Red Sox superstar <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=2717">Pedro Martinez</a>. He walked to the mound slowly and jovially, drinking in the moment. He then tossed a not particularly aggressive pitch to his former teammate, catcher <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=3760">Jason Varitek</a>. The signature drum bit of &#8220;In the Air Tonight&#8221; blasted, and the moment was complete.</p>
<p>Pedro Martinez last played at Fenway Park on June 28, 2006, during his tenure with the New York Mets. He was summarily defeated, giving up seven hits and six earned runs in just three innings of work. After the game, he reflected that while he enjoyed the experience of returning to Fenway, he would&#8217;ve preferred not to have played the game in the first place. It was a mediocre epilogue to what was a brilliant career with the Red Sox, one that included Cy Young awards, an All-Star Game MVP, and a World Series ring. Bringing Pedro back to Fenway one last time was a nice way of reminding us how good a pitcher Pedro Martinez was, and what a quintessential Red Sox member he was as well.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/04/16/regarding-opening-night-pedros-future/">Regarding Opening Night: Pedro&#8217;s Future</a> (314 words)</p>

<p>98 years of Opening DAY at Fenway Park tradition ends tonight, because ESPN wants it to. It’s not just ESPN though; Tuesday and Wednesday’s games will also be played at night, to increase TV ratings. Because when it’s Yanks/Sox Rivalry ™, it’s got to be played in Prime Time! And end around midnight.</p>
<p>At least the weather gods have bailed out the people attending the game, as it&#8217;s about 40 degrees warmer than normal right now (balmy and in the 70&#8217;s as this intro is being typed at about 6 PM, with the sun still up.)</p>
<p>Okay, we accept that money runs everything and that all Yankee/Red Sox Rivalry (TM) games must be played at night. But then why start the season with these games, and play them at the time when they have the least possible impact on the pennant race? Isn’t Opening Day at Fenway Park big enough, without forcing the Rivalry ™ into it? I guess not this year, because there won’t be an Opening Day at Fenway Park.</p>
<p>Thus endeth the first rant of the new season.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/04/04/live-blog-yankees-at-red-sox-opening-night-april-4-2010/">Live Blog: Yankees at Red Sox, Opening Night. April 4, 2010</a> (3,959 words)</p>
