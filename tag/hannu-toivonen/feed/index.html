				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="justify">After a punishing skating session, Bruins fans were enthusiastic about the matchup between their team and the long hated Habs. Despite their best efforts, the Bruins fell short; thanks to a brutal performance of Tim Thomas between the pipes.</p>
<p align="justify">I must say that I was very frustrated by the result since the team worked very hard to get back in that game being down 2-0 (the second goal was a gift by Thomas) after one period. We can&#8217;t stress this issue enough: it starts with goaltending. The Bruins were good in the first half of the season because of Thomas&#8217;s performance. Now, the team has a tough time building a long winning streak because of Thomas&#8217;s inconsistency. Peter Chiarelli acquired Manny Fernandez because Tim Thomas was not good enough and because their were questions about his consistency. In his last 10 games, Thomas had, at least, 4 bad games where he was a factor in the team losses. Of course, it&#8217;s not his fault entirely. One player can&#8217;t make a team win, but in hockey, you need strong goaltending to achieve a high level of performance. With Fernandez on the self, the Bruins are in the same situation as last year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="justify">I thought that Christmas would be calm and sweet for the Bruins, but a <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/hockey/bruins/articles/2007/12/25/bruins_must_shop_before_they_drop/">column</a>, written by Kevin Paul Dupont, suggesting that Phil Kessel could be on the trade market, fired up boards and forums. I think it&#8217;s time for me to weigh in.</p>
<p align="justify">What can I say? A young, promising player, on the block, because his offensive production declines (a bit) while he&#8217;s learning to play on both sides of the rink? What&#8217;s the problem here? Well &#8230; there&#8217;s no problem. However, it illustrates how short-sighted Kevin Paul Dupont is. This is not the first time that KDP has written a column about trading young players. He wrote the same thing about Brad Boyes, Hannu Toivonen and Milan Jurcina. These three players were qualified as &#8220;strugglers&#8221; by Dupont, but became very decent NHL&#8217;ers elsewhere.</p>
<p align="justify">Phil Kessel had 29 points in 70 games in his first season (where he successfully recovered from a cancer) while Joe Thornton had 5 points in 55 games in his first season. Of course, through the years, KPD was all over Thornton and criticized him on many occasions. When Thornton was traded, Dupont was the <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/hockey/bruins/articles/2005/12/01/hell_have_to_his_find_way_in_san_jose/">first to applaud</a>, but the final result was disastrous, at the very best, for the Bruins. Of course, KDP blamed Mike O&#8217;Connell for not getting a good &#8220;return,&#8221; but the fact of the matter is that Dupont was dead wrong in his evaluation of Thornton.</p>
<p align="justify">There&#8217;s a general rule in every sport that says that &#8220;developing young kids takes time.&#8221; The Bruins hit rock-bottom for years because of their unwillingness to be patient with their young players. They adopted an ill-conceived strategy where a long-term building process is replaced by some free agent signings. Sadly for the Bruins, it didn&#8217;t work, but this result is not surprising since the New York Rangers adopted this same strategy for years, yielding pathetic results. Once again, it raise this hard and, yet simple, question: Does this organization ever learn?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="justify">After trailing 4-0, the B&#8217;s worked hard to get back in the game and successfully grabbed one point by losing in OT.</p>
<p align="justify">This game was a wild one and the goal-tending (Thomas, Coklin) was horrible from both sides. Crosby and Malkin had a good game (as expected) while Marco Sturm finally woke up from his hibernation. Marc Savard and Glen Murray had an awful game with a differential of -3 for the night. On a positive note, the Bruins worked hard to get back in this game and they never quit. Talk about character!!!</p>
<p align="justify">The Bruins will play Saturday against the St-Louis Blues, and it will be a very interesting game to watch since Brad Boyes and Hannu Toivonen could make their debut at the garden with their new team&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="justify">I must admit, as a long time fan, that this Bruins team is very surprising. I looked last night at clips of the past season and wonder how this team could be so bad in their own end. Their 3rd period collapses were so predictable that it becomes a running gag among the fans.</p>
<p align="justify">So far, the Bruins are 4th in the conference with 39 points. If you consider that they finished with 76 points last season, it gives you the amplitude of the improvement. On the defensive side, the Bruins only gave up 81 goals so far to the opponents and there&#8217;s <strong>only <a href="http://bruins.nhl.com/team/app?page=TeamStandings&amp;service=page&amp;type=CON">5 teams</a> who allowed less goals</strong> the Bruins. That&#8217;s an incredible and very positive change if you consider that the team allowed a whopping <strong><a href="http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/teamseasons.php?tid=32">289 goals against</a></strong>, last year.</p>
<p align="justify">The Bruins have a similar roster from last year (Fernandez, Thornton and Schaefer doesn&#8217;t have a lot of impact, so far) so, what&#8217;s the difference this year? Coaching! The Bruins found a coach who has leadership and finally convinced the players to buy into his system. Not an exciting one (I concede), but a system which prevent the team from killing itself with bad turnovers and stupid mistakes. Slowly but surely, this Bruins team is starting to do the little things right.</p>
<p align="justify">Looking back, fans were probably too hard on the players last season. It&#8217;s clear now that Dave Lewis was the problem and his uncanny ability to do nothing has cost the team one year (results wise) and a couple of good young players (Boyes, Jurcina and Toivonen were all traded mostly because of Lewis inability to help them). The Bruins were and are better then we thought. Of course, we will have to wait and see how they will react through the rest of the season, but words like respect, character, passion and work ethic are now on the &#8220;menu du jour.&#8221; Only for that, the Bruins are a better team.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Quick Notes:</strong> Bergy feels well and start a very light workout, yesterday. Andrew Alberts is suffering from a post concussion syndrome and should be out for a couple of games. Bobby Allen filled the void but don&#8217;t be surprised to see the Bruins recall Matt Lashoff who played great hockey in Providence. The B&#8217;s play tonight against the Pens and that&#8217;s your chance to see two of the most exciting players of the NHL: Crosby and Malkin&#8230;</p>
