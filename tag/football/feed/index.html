This is the first time the pigskin flies through the air in Kenmore Square since 1968.</p>
<p>Professional football has a rich history in Boston. Believe it, or not, three professional franchises called Fenway Park home: the Redskins in the 1930s, the Boston Yanks, and the Boston Patriots. The Redskins shipped <i>out</i> of Boston in 1936 for Washington, D.C. The Boston Yanks played four seasons at America’s most beloved ballpark from 1944-1948. After this franchise folded, the final team to play on the outfield grass was the Boston Patriots. The last game played in 1968 was against the Cincinnati Bengals. The Pats would move to Foxboro in 1969.</p>

<p>Although this is a preseason game, the match offers fans and bettors with the chance to see Miami’s recent acquisitions, including former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Mike Wallace, who signed a five-year contract for an estimated $60 million. Other free agents stated to make their debut with Miami are former Baltimore Ravens linebacker Dannell Ellerbe, former Oakland Raiders linebacker Philip Wheeler, former New York Jets tight end Dustin Keller and former St. Louis Rams wide receiver Brandon Gibson. In addition, 2013 draftees Dion Jordan (defensive End), Jamar Taylor (Cornerback), Dallas Thomas (Tackle/Guard), Will Davis (cornerback), Jelani Jenkins (Linebacker) and Dion Sims (tight end) are also stated to make their professional during the preseason.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2013/08/02/2013-nfl-preseason-ready-for-some-action/">2013 NFL Preseason: Ready for Some Action?</a> (195 words)</p>

<p>In the NFL unsportsmanlike conduct penalties have generally been obvious calls: receivers like Terrell Owens and Chad Ochocinco (back when he actually scored touchdowns) using the ball as a prop after scoring a touchdown.</p>
<p>However, two plays in the non-professional levels of football have brought the nature and definition of unsportsmanlike conduct penalties into question.</p>

<p>When I mentioned this to friends, they jokingly responded, “What, to get the top draft pick?” While this vestige of pro sports fandom probably had more of an effect on rooting against my team than I imagine, more than anything I wanted to drive home just how bad this team is.</p>
<p>Frank Spaziani is not an FBS head coach, and the more horrendous a season he had, the more change would be enacted. I fully expect him to be fired after this season, although with a presumably 3-9 finish, there is unlikely to be a complete overhaul of the program.</p>
<p>There should be though. Why would anyone want to watch Boston College play at this point? Chase Rettig is probably more suited to be a Chaser than a quarterback, and that’s a position in a sport that doesn’t exist. Luke Kuechly is the only decent player on the team, and he is forced to do everything for every other member of the defense.</p>

With close losses to smarty-pants institutions Northwestern and Duke sandwiched around an evisceration at Central Florida, it is already time to write the season off.</p>
<p>This is a bad team, and there’s little reason for hope.</p>
<p>To start, the team’s two best offensive players, Ifeanyi Momah and Montel Harris, are injured. During a fantastic season opener in which he had eight catches for 171 yards, Momah tore the ACL in his left knee, knocking him out for the season. Harris, the ACC Preseason Player of The Year, has yet to play this season after having arthroscopic knee surgery in the offseason.</p>
<p>While there is a chance he may make his debut in the next few weeks, head coach Frank Spaziani had made comments alluding to the possibility that Harris may miss the entire season.</p>

What they do not know is who they will host in their first playoff game. Currently there are seven teams fighting for two wild card spots, which gives us so many different playoff scenarios it hurts my head just trying to comprehend it. However, the Patriots play a crucial role in a couple team&#8217;s playoff scenarios and could have a say in who they face in the first round of the playoffs.</p>
<p>For example, if the Patriots rest their starters and allow the Texans to win, they would completely eliminate the Dolphins, who need the Patriots to win. They would also virtually eliminate the Steelers and Jaguars, both of whom only have one playoff scenario in which the Patriots lose. New England could also try to win and eliminate the Texans from the playoffs if they feel they are the stronger opponent. In any case, the Patriots do not have a final say in who does and does not make the playoffs, but they can make it difficult for a couple teams to climb that final hurdle to reach the postseason.</p>
