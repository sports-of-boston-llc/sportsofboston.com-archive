<p>The surprising American team has forced Russia vs Canada to be a quarterfinals match instead of the Gold Medal Game. In doing so, they&#8217;ve captured the top spots in the Olympic standings and our power ranking. The middle of the rankings are a little jumbled (thanks to Canada moving up our power ranking) when compared to the Olympic standings. #9 Belarus, #10 Norway, #11 Germany, and #12 Latvia all were booted out in the qualifying round, but they were surprisingly all by one, save for Germany&#8217;s 8-2 loss to Canada; Belarus lost in a shootout, Latvia lost in overtime, and Norway lost in regulation.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/02/24/sob-2010-olympic-ice-hockey-power-rankings-mens-quarterfinals/">SoB 2010 Olympic Ice Hockey Power Rankings: Men&#8217;s Quarterfinals</a> (527 words)</p>

(Chris O'Meara, Associated Press)" ></a><p>The men&#8217;s round-robin hockey play has seen some huge surprises in 2010, like the U.S. knocking off Canada for the first time in 50 years, and what about Slovakia beating the Russians? The Russia/Canada match everyone thought would be the gold medal game is instead a potential quarterfinal contest. The defending champion Sweden is #2 behind the also unbeaten United States. Latvia emerged as the worst team, just barely behind fellow point-less country, Germany. So much is going on, and it&#8217;s still anyone&#8217;s medal, so take a look at what the brackets look like following the completion of the preliminary rounds:</p>
<h2>#1 United States</h2>
<p>With <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/02/21/americans-top-mighty-canadians-5-3/">a surprising upset over Canada</a>, the U.S. claimed the top spot heading into the quarterfinal round. It&#8217;s been all Ryan Miller so far, and he has impressed. He has made key stops when needed, especially when Canada took a total of 45 shots against him. The offense has scored 14 goals over three games, tied for the most with Canada. Their #1 seed ensures that the United States will face either Switzerland or Belarus, then likely either Finland or the Czechs. From there, it would likely be Sweden, Russia, or Canada in the finals. The U.S. has what it takes to win, but they&#8217;ll need to give it their all. Surprise losses by Canada and Russia greatly help their chances of another miracle on ice.</p>
<h2>#2 Sweden</h2>
<p>The defending gold medalists finished unbeaten with a 3-0 defeat of Finland, the #4 seed. That defeat showed Sweden is able to hold their own against the top teams in the bracket, but the most goals they scored in a game was four against Belarus. Many games have seen the winners surpass that mark, which means Sweden&#8217;s offense will need to heat up if they hope to appear on the podium. Sweden awaits the winner of Slovakia/Norway, which shouldn&#8217;t be too difficult. Heavy hitters Russia and Canada, whichever one beats the other, will give Sweden a true test as to whether or not they belong with the elite teams.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/02/23/2010-olympic-mens-hockey-playoff-bracket/">2010 Olympic Men&#8217;s Hockey: Playoff Bracket</a> (611 words)</p>

The women also have classification games to complete the rankings and decide who is the Detroit Lions of women&#8217;s hockey. A quadruple header is set for Monday, leading off with the U.S. facing Sweden, in a battle of beauties vs blondes. So without further ado, check out how the tournament will shake up below:</p>
<h2>7th/8th Place Game: China vs Slovakia</h2>
<p>This game determines the bottom of the barrel, who will return to their country shamed and win-less. Knowing how China behaves with dissidents, it had better be Slovakia for the Chinese girls&#8217; sakes. And even though the Chinese have scored one less goal throughout the tournament, they&#8217;ve given up 13 less. Even considering their blowout against Canada, the Slovakians have given up too many goals for comfort against Sweden and Switzerland. China only gave up two goals each against Finland and Russia, following their thrashing against the Americans. Expect to see China win with an insurance goal or two to spare.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/02/22/2010-olympic-womens-hockey-playoff-bracket/">2010 Olympic Women&#8217;s Hockey: Playoff Bracket</a> (371 words)</p>

Which of the 15 events will Americans love to watch most? Which of them will have the most intriguing storylines? How well will America perform in each event? Only time will tell for certain, but that never stops any media speculation in the least.</p>
<p>Here at Sports of Boston, we’re thinking the same thoughts as everyone else. For one Olympic angle, please enjoy a view of what could very will be the most exciting events to watch, at least from an American point of view. And no, <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/videos/index.jhtml?videoId=72002&amp;title=ice-skating" target="_new">figure skating</a> isn’t one of them.</p>
<h2>Bronze Medal: Snowboarding</h2>
<p>Snowboarding is an event where athletes make huge jumps on thin pieces of wood, fiber glass, carbon fiber, and what have you. They bounce off banks, moguls, and turns and reach heights where huge falls and corresponding injuries are possible. If it’s crazy enough for the X-Games, chances are Americans will be crazy enough to succeed.
