After a thrilling 64 matches, Spain has emerged victorious, handing the still-championship-less Netherlands their third loss in the last game. Spain won 1-0 (again) behind defense and almost literally last-minute heroics. There were a total of 14 yellow cards given: nine went to the Netherlands, and two of them went to Heitinga, booting him out in the 109th minute.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, the winner of the SoB 2010 FIFA Pick &#8216;Em is &#8230; Dan! It might not be that surprising, given his lead. Despite missing out on the consolation game, Brian still took 2nd, thanks to his buffer hold on the position. The Netherlands hurt Robert and Teddy, though Robert&#8217;s damage was mitigated by getting two points from the goal timing for the Bronze.</p>
<p>So there you have it. The Pick &#8216;Em is now complete, and you can view the entire results, as brought to you by Paul the Octopus, below.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/07/11/2010-fifa-world-cup-expert-picks-finals-results/">2010 FIFA World Cup Expert Picks: Finals Results</a> (894 words)</p>

He has agreed with our staff, picking the Germans to take 3rd place and the Spanish to win it all. While Germany is a unanimous pick, the Netherlands were favored by two of the seven experts to win, perhaps because we (in general) think the Finals will be decided deeper than the German game.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a rough month for many of the teams so far, and I think the North Korean squad was sent to live on a farm upstate by now, but six of us have stuck with you throughout all of it. Check below to see how we all think the final round will turn out. And be aware that not only are we all picking the MVP of the tournament, but <strong>all point values are doubled!!!</strong> That means that picking the game winner and the minute of the winning goal to within five is worth <strong>four points,</strong> and picking the MVP and the minute of the winning goal to within fifteen is worth <strong>two points.</strong></p>
<p>And just in case a tiebreaker is needed, we&#8217;ve also picked the minute in the Spain vs Netherlands match-up in which the first yellow card is given. Whoever gets closest will break the tie, or if no yellow card is given, whoever guessed the latest time will do so.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/07/10/2010-fifa-world-cup-expert-picks-finals/">2010 FIFA World Cup Expert Picks: Finals</a> (840 words)</p>

<p>In this Semifinals, Spain&#8217;s performance did well by Brian and Teddy, and surprisingly enough, everyone scored at least a point on that game&#8217;s timing of the goal. Dan is still leading comfortably, with Brian trailing right behind. But the top three spots on the podium have yet to be definitively decided, so it&#8217;s still up for grabs. The Netherlands upset Brazil and Spain halted Germany&#8217;s offense, thanks to a very knowledgeable octopus, so there&#8217;s plenty to think of.

Uruguay is representing all of South America now, but the Dutch will look to build on their upset of Brazil. The Germans have been on an absolute tear, and have some beef with Spain over the European Championships. But of course, anything can happen, so be sure to keep watching.</p>
<p>According to our staff, the Netherlands will definitely move through, and relatively quickly at that. The Germans should also win, but later in the game and not without a challenge from Spain. And if your name is towards the beginning or end of the alphabet, you&#8217;re more likely to disagree with the others. Interesting trend, eh?</p>
<p>As usual, picking a game winner and time of the winning goal (to within five minutes) is worth <strong>two points.</strong> Picking the timing of the winning goal to within fifteen minutes is worth <strong>one point</strong> instead.

Uruguay defeated Ghana in penalty kicks while the Netherlands beat top-ranked Brazil, both from behind. Germany dissected Argentina, and Spain overcame a bevy of penalty kicks to beat Paraguay in regulation 1-nil. It was a tough round for many teams, but a blessing for others, just as it was for our staff.</p>
<p>Robert was the only one to guess all four winners correctly, and even guessed the timing of the Netherlands&#8217; victory well enough to help vault him from worst to third. Teddy, KC, and myself had a rough time of it, but are still in the running, and all are legitimately in the running to finish in the top half of our draw.</p>
<p>Next up is the Semifinals. It&#8217;s coming down to the wire, so there&#8217;s bound to be even rougher play and even more terrible pretend injuries, so stay tuned. You know our staff of experts will be tuning in, in an ever-increasingly harsh war to get more points.

They were the only SoB favored team to not win, and yours truly was the only one with the foresight to see that coming. I&#8217;d like to thank Ghana for helping to vault me into 3rd place. Arch-rivals England were booted out in a much more humiliating fashion, after scoring a goal that bounced about my entire height behind the goal line, but the refs gave a giant middle finger to England by not counting the goal. Now, FIFA will CONSIDER using replay technology, but ONLY for goal line reviews. Jim Joyce anyone?</p>
<p>Japan pushed Paraguay to penalty kicks before finally losing out. Tough. But at least they held Dan&#8217;s lead down, 43 points to 36. Robert&#8217;s backing everyone up at 31, but is still very much in it, with 16 points on the line in the next round. Portugal, the world&#8217;s #3, tried to help, but Ricardo Costa was red carded straight up when his counterpart on Spain took a dive. Oh, those referees.</p>
<p>At any rate, there&#8217;s still plenty of action left to go, with the world&#8217;s top two teams en route to a possible meeting in the Finals. Stay tuned until Friday, when the next round of predictions will be revealed, and check below to see how everyone did.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/06/29/2010-fifa-world-cup-expert-picks-round-of-16-results/">2010 FIFA World Cup Expert Picks: Round of 16 Results</a> (552 words)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got good news and bad news for you, U.S. soccer fans. The bad news is that, despite Landon Donovan&#8217;s last-minute heroics in the Algeria game to send us into the knockout stages, despite the heart-stopping draw (that was really an American win) against Slovenia, the 2010 World Cup is not going to be looked back upon as the watershed moment that catapulted soccer firmly into the American mainstream. Jim Rome and his moronic ilk are still going to scoff, and you&#8217;re still going to get funny looks at parties when you wear your Arsenal jersey.<br />

There&#8217;s plenty of action between now and Tuesday, so turn on your TiVos (TiVoes?) and catch all of the action. I hear the North Korean squad&#8217;s execution will be broadcast live on ESPN2. With the Group Stages over, the SoB staff (the remaining seven of us anyway) are hear to give you their choices for the next round. Was Japan able to garner some votes? Can the U.S. move through? Spain and Portugal (#2 and #3) are set to face off, so who will win? Can England, after their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEeuEURCKco" target="_new">embarrassing GOAL!!!!!!!!</a> against the Americans, pull through against WWII rivals Germany? These questions will be answered &#8230; right now.</p>
<p>Brazil and the Netherlands were picked unanimously to win, which would set up a huge quarterfinal contest. Uruguay, Argentina, and the United States were all all but unanimously picked, while Spain should defeat Portugal, Paraguay should beat Japan and Germany should beat England, but at 5-2, those games could produce upsets easily, at least easier than the other games. The United States and Ghana is looking to be the game that will go the furthest to the wire, assuming you think America will win. Perhaps not so surprisingly, Brazil looks to have the easiest time.</p>
<p>A correct pick for the winner of each game in the first sudden-death round is worth <strong>two points</strong>. In addition, experts will also be picking the minute of the game in which they think the winning goal will be made. (If, for example, someone thinks the U.S. will win 3-1, they&#8217;ll be guessing the minute in which they think the U.S. will score their second goal.) A correct pick to within fifteen minutes earns <strong>one point</strong>, and a correct pick to within five minutes earns <strong>two points</strong> instead. There&#8217;s a lot of points (32) up for grabs, so check below to see how everyone is thinking the Round of 16 will go.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/06/26/2010-fifa-world-cup-expert-picks-round-of-16/">2010 FIFA World Cup Expert Picks: Round of 16</a> (534 words)</p>

There were plenty of surprises, with Japan making a surprise entry into the second round to face Paraguay, in what should be a fun match to watch. There were significantly more surprises that were negative for the teams involved, most notably last time&#8217;s winner (Italy) and runner-up (France) both getting booted out, and finishing at the bottom of their groups at that. Of the six African teams, only Ghana advanced. South Africa beat up a broken France, and Cote d&#8217;Ivoire beat up North Korea, so we can&#8217;t count those games as success.</p>
<p>Argentina and the Netherlands are on pace to meet in the Finals, having been the only two to score a perfect nine points. Cameroon and North Korea were the only ones to finish without any points. I can&#8217;t imagine Kim Jong Il will be happy. If I were a North Korean soccer player, I would just refuse to go back to North Korea, and maybe get a job as a FIFA referee, and work a U.S. game. Those refs can obviously do whatever they want without consequences. Congratulations to the U.S. for winning their group with seven points, on a related note.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/06/25/2010-fifa-world-cup-expert-picks-group-stage-results/">2010 FIFA World Cup Expert Picks: Group Stage Results</a> (539 words)</p>
