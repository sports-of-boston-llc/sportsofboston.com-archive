He did it all without his number one wideout in Kelvin Benjamin, who will be ready to go for the 2016 campaign. Many think that Cam will regress back to the mean this year, as he won&#8217;t be forced to run as often with an improved offensive line and the return of some key contributors in the passing game. That being said, I&#8217;m of the belief that Cam is poised for another monster year in 2016. He made tremendous strides in term of accuracy and pocket presence last season, and at the ripe young age of 27, he still has room to grow in all aspects of his game. If Cam can continue to develop as a passer, use his legs when the opportunity presents itself, and avoid the kind of injuries that have thwarted his fantasy potential over the years, he should be an absolute stud once again in 2016.</p>
<p>2.) <strong>Aaron Rodgers</strong>&#8211; The longtime &#8220;King of Fantasy QB&#8217;s&#8221; was finally dethroned this past season, but that doesn&#8217;t mean he isn&#8217;t poised for another big year in 2016. Last year, Rodgers finished a disappointing 7th in QB rankings, (ESPN scoring) so conventional wisdom might suggest that he&#8217;s not the fantasy superstar we&#8217;ve grown accustomed to over the years. Well in the words of my guy Lee Corso &#8220;Not so fast my friends!&#8221;. Rodgers less-than-stellar numbers can be attributed to a number of factors, the least of which have to do with his play or ability. First off, his receiving corps were held together by glue and popsicle sticks, with Jordy Nelson out for the entire year and Randall Cobb battling a bevy of injuries over the course of the season. Secondly, Rodgers once stud RB1 Eddie Lacy took one too many trips to PF Chang&#8217;s last offseason and quickly became one big, fat punchline. Eddie Lacy wasn&#8217;t just football fat, he was &#8220;Jonah Hill pre-21 Jump Street fat&#8221;. Luckily for Rodgers, Nelson appears as though he&#8217;ll be ready to start the year and Lacy has popped in the &#8220;Kanye West get right for the summer workout tape&#8221; and has slimmed down considerably. Given those developments and the fact that Rodgers is still the most gifted thrower in the league, he should once again return to fantasy dominance in 2016.</p>
<p>3.) <strong>Tom Brady + Replacement Level QB-</strong> Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know that Tom is suspended for the first four games of the year for the horrendous acts he committed against humanity. I know that most quarterbacks would be at a tremendous disadvantage having missed the first four games of the season, and I know that it might take Tom and the boys a few weeks to truly get firing on all cylinders.  What I also know is that Tom Brady put together a stellar 2015 campaign that saw him finish 2nd among QB&#8217;s in points (ESPN scoring) and throw for the most touchdowns (36) and the least interceptions (7) among starting quarterbacks. He did all of this while missing his number one wide receiver in Julian Edelman for a majority of the season, as well as emerging pass-catching threat Dion Lewis. Consider these factors along with the common knowledge that Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all-time, and you can begin to see why I am so high on him despite his four game suspension. Brady will also benefit from the return of left tackle Nate Solder as well as offensive line coach Dante Scarnecchia, who should help to remedy the Patriots porous offensive line that allowed Brady to be sacked 38 times in 2015. When Brady does finally take the field, he will be more motivated than ever to prove that Deflategate was one giant hoax from the start, and that he and the Patriots are still the big, bad bullies on the block. Drafting a QB in the later rounds with a favorable schedule weeks 1-4 (something I will get into in my draft strategy column)  along with Brady could result in the highest scoring QB for you and your team in 2016. A pissed off Tom Brady offense will be running up the score every chance they get, and that will be sure to render big time fantasy numbers this coming season.</p>

Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski, to be specific. The pair has combined for 65 touchdowns throughout the seven years Gronkowski has been in the league, titanic numbers for two players that were not drafted in the first round. Compare those 65 touchdowns to Joe Montana and Jerry Rice, who scored 67 times together (over nine years).</p>
<p>Are Gronk and Brady the best QB-TE duo of all time? Yes. Are they the best QB-receiver duo of all time? Most likely not (this year), but if the production stays at a high level, expect Brady and Gronk to finish with around 90 total touchdown connections.</p>
<p>These stats and more contribute to the reasoning behind NFL players voting for the QB in the two spot, and the tight end in the nine spot. Both are well-deserved, and some Patriots fans expressed distaste that Gronk was not higher, above players such as Julio Jones and Aaron Rodgers.</p>
<p>Also making the list was Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman, coming off a season hindered by a broken foot. Edelman, once described as the toughest cover in the NFL, is the type of blue collar worker that New Englanders love. Number eleven takes hits across the middle, has a nose for the end zone, and always places the team first. His true return this year, as opposed to his return in the postseason against KC, should bring about another 7 touchdowns for himself and Brady, once Brady returns in week 5 against Cleveland. Edelman cracked the list at number 87.</p>

The Patriots and Broncos have provided fans with some great games over the past few seasons. The championship game brings not just the top two seeded teams in the AFC together but also the top two quarterbacks of this era of football to face each other once again in what is likely the last Brady vs Manning post season match up. With the high stakes of a Super Bowl appearance on the line, the hype of a Brady vs Manning contest, and the pairing of Gronk, Edelman, and Amendola vs the Denver secondary led by Harris Jr, Talib, and the physically dangerous T.J. Ward has also led to some entertaining banter between the teams.</p>
<p>In a SportsCenter interview Tuesday Chris Harris Jr. was asked about stopping Rob Gronkowski, his response was the following: &#8220;You gotta hit him low, man. Hit him in his knees. That&#8217;s the best chance you got of hitting him.&#8221; As many know Gronkowski has had his share of injuries, particularly to his knee dating back to the 2013 ACL and MCL tear precipitated by T.J. Ward&#8217;s untimely contact to the knee at the exact moment Gronk planted his foot in the ground. The hit jarred open the debate of low hits being clean hits as Gronk was sidelined with the season ending injury. Another scare for the big tight end happened on a snowy night this November in the lost to Denver where a shoulder to knee appeared much worse than it actually was and had Gronk and all of New England holding their breath. To be fair to Chris Harris Jr tackling Gronkowski low may be the only way to drag him to the ground. He is too big and strong for most defensive backs to pull down alone and, with speed to out run linebackers if able to get loose, is one of the best yards after contact receivers in the league. Whether Gronkowski actually took offense to the comment about hitting him low or just sounded off in anticipation of the biggest game of the season Gronk responded in a very Gronk way with this double entendre via twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/PaetyWinant">https://twitter.com/PaetyWinant</a>. Without diving into the implied meaning of the duel-edged comment it is clear to see Gronkowski fans and followers will likely have a laugh at the expense of an unappreciative Broncos squad, as tensions between the teams continue to rise heading into Sunday.</p>
<p>With the history of these two post-season giants, a quarterback rivalry dating back over a decade, Gronkowski&#8217;s history and Ward&#8217;s presence the comments made by Harris and response from Gronk have gained a lot of traction in the build up to Sunday&#8217;s game. Ultimately this is probably the least serious thing that will be discussed this week leading up to the game but it is entertaining to see the two sides go at each other and for those following along to have a laugh as the Broncos now have some great white board material. After all it is going to almost necessary as the week rolls on to talk about something other than Brady vs Manning statistics and which analyst picks who as the best quarterback of the era. At this point both signal callers know that success is measured in rings and both will be playing for a chance to get their teams to another Super Bowl and solidify an already established greatness.</p>

The Chiefs were dominant on defense and forced a shaky Houston offense into a borderline embarrassing performance. Kansas City was able to get after Houston quarterback Brian Hoyer forcing a fumble and four interceptions. Despite the pressure put on by the Chiefs defensive line Hoyer was also his own worst enemy making terrible decisions, particularly in the red zone. Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith and the KC offense was efficient against a tough Houston defensive that held them to just six points in the first half however they led 13-0 at the break thanks to a 106-yard kickoff returned for a touchdown by Knile Davis to start the game. In the second half the Chiefs were able to open up the lead as Hoyer and the Texans continued to shoot themselves in the foot. Kansas City, playing on the road, was not phased by the 71,000 screaming  fans or defensive stud J.J. Watt who they avoided with quick hitting pass plays, screens, sweeps and extra manpower. Alex Smith finished the day 17 of 22 for 190 yards with a touchdown and a rare interception, coach Andy Reid&#8217;s experience and game plan worked perfectly. Kansas City is now riding an 11-game win streak coming into Foxborough for next week&#8217;s divisional round playoff match up and should be as confident as ever.</p>
<p>One key problem for the Chiefs is the status of star receiver Jeremy Macklin who has been a go to guy for Alex Smith all season. Macklin suffered and injury to his ACL late in the second half of the win in Houston and did not return. He is due to have an MRI today to assess the extent of the damage, KC fans will be crossing their fingers in hopes that Macklin does not have a tear in that right knee. Maclin caught 87 passes for 1,088 yards and eight touchdowns during the regular season. Also banged up coming into the game against the Patriots will be Tamba Hali with a thumb and knee injury who had limited action against the Texans but is a key figure in the pass rush for KC that will be essential to getting pressure on Tom Brady, the formula for disrupting the flow of the Patriots offense. Linebacker Justin Houston also seemed to tweak his knee which has been a lingering injury for him this season causing him to miss five games.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2016/01/10/pats-draw-streaking-chiefs-for-divisional-round-playoff/">Pats Draw Streaking Chiefs For Divisional Round Playoff</a> (519 words)</p>

Curran of CSNNE tweet that the chances of Julian Edelman returning to action on Sunday are &#8220;real long.&#8221; Edelman has been out since he broke a bone in his foot during the first half of the Patriots win over the Giants in November.  The timetable for Edelman&#8217;s recovery could open the possibility for him to play this week and he has been practicing over the last several weeks. However, the Patriots can likely defeat the Dolphins and lock up the number one seed without him and the team has had little injury luck this season.</p>
<p>Prior to his injury, Edelman had amassed 61 catches for 692 yards and seven touchdowns in just under eight and a half games. He was also a major reason why the Patriots&#8217; poor offensive line play did not show up as he was able to get open quickly and allow Tom Brady to throw faster than pass rushers could get to him.</p>
<p>This is an important function of Edelman, as well as Danny Amendola, and they will be counted on when they return. Because the team already has a first round bye, sitting Edelman out this weekend would give him an additional two weeks of rest before returning to action.</p>
<p>It likely won&#8217;t be clear until tomorrow or Saturday if Edelman is playing, but it would not be surprising for the team to hold him and out and play things on the safe side.</p>

Adding Jackson to the 53-man roster put the Patriots at a total of 75 different players making up the 53-man roster over the course of this season. The injuries have been noticeable and if this were any other team they would have been crippled. Instead Bill Belichick and Tom Brady have steered the ship to another first round playoff bye and with another win can lock up home field advantage throughout the playoffs. Injuries are part of the game but it&#8217;s obvious that no one handles them better than the New England Patriots.</p>
<p>&#8211; Joey Iosefa is the exact reason Patriots fans only wonder one thing every year which is &#8220;are they going to have the first or second seed?&#8221; LeGarrette Blount was finally getting the late season production that he has been so good at. Just as he&#8217;s getting the carries he goes down for the year with a hip injury. The expectation was James White and Brandon Bolden would see an increased role, which they both did. In classic Belichick fashion he promoted Iosefa from he practice squad on Saturday night. Iosefa then carried the ball 14 times for 51 hard earned yards, while also blocking as a full back. Sure it wasn&#8217;t a Jonas Gray 200-yard game but Belichick once again found production where you&#8217;d least expect it. The addition of Steven Jackson adds depth and experience, not to mention he has fresh legs. For how the Patriots use the running game they definitely have the pieces in place for a postseason push.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/12/21/notes-and-observations-week-15-patriots-clinch-1st-round-bye-handling-the-titans-33-16/">Notes and Observations Week 15: Patriots Clinch 1st Round Bye Handling the Titans 33-16</a> (1,430 words)</p>
