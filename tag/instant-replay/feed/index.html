While that same rule still applies today, the 2014 season will likely welcome new uses of instant replay for base running, plays at home plate, fan interference all over the ballpark, and whether or not a batter may have been hit by a pitch.</p>
<p>The expansion of replay has been seen as increasingly necessary, given the use of replay in the other three major North American sports and the exceptional high definition quality of televisions for fans at home. So while MLB certainly wants to get every call correct, the question is where to draw the line on replay, and how to maximize on correct calls while still minimizing game lengths, which have consistently increased over the last few decades.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2013/07/14/major-league-baseballs-instant-replay-problem/">Major League Baseball&#8217;s Instant Replay Problem</a> (603 words)</p>

<p>Talk shows and newspapers were immediately flush with commentary on instant replay and even the possibility of Bud Selig ruling a reversal of the call. The commissioner did in fact meet to discuss both matters the following day. After the meeting, <a href="http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/37479309/ns/sports-baseball/">Selig announced</a> that expanded instant replay will be discussed more in depth in the future, and the missed call was to remain a hit leaving Galarraga with only a great story and perhaps the best perfect game in the history of baseball – if you consider that he used 28 outs, rather than 27.</p>

I&#8217;m a fan of instant replay in baseball and am happy that MLB decided to bring it&#8217;s decision making into the 20th century.
