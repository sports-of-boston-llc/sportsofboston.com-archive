New England seemed unstoppable on both ends of the ball. Edelman, Brady, and the unknown Dion Lewis were producing at a level that was other worldly. Malcolm Butler led a defense that seemed to suffer no immediate backlash from losing two of their best players, and all was well. However, a torrent of injuries was soon to follow, with Lewis going down in Week 9 against Washington, Edelman breaking his foot in New York, and Gronkowski memorably going down hard in Denver (only to miss a short period of time). </span>(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2016/05/04/the-5-most-intriguing-games-the-patriots-will-play-this-year/">The 5 Most Intriguing Games the Patriots Will Play This Year</a> (703 words)</p>

The press conference started with statements and stories of gratitude and greatness in regards to the legendary 18-year veteran by Broncos President and CEO Joe Ellis, followed by Vice President of Denver football operations and legend in his own right John Elway, as well as current head coach Gary Kubiak. The speeches highlighted Manning&#8217;s greatness as a player in Indianapolis and Denver but also focused on his leadership, organization and community contribution, teamwork, and personal relationships he had with everyone involved with him in Denver. In a split screen on ESPN one could see the three aforementioned speakers giving examples of his illustriousness career in all capacities mentioned above with an emotional Peyton Manning doing his best to fight back tears.</p>
<p>When it was Peyton&#8217;s turn to speak he was as he usual is during interviews and media gatherings, all class. He had difficulty containing his emotions but did get through his speech which was full of career highlights and woes, stories of his first days on the NFL gridiron, and reflections on what specific moments in time meant to him both playing the game and interacting with players past and present in those moments.</p>
<p>Manning alluded to the Patriots on more than one occasion, the following is transcript from his speech: &#8220;I’m going to miss a steak dinner at St. Elmo&#8217;s in Indianapolis after a win. My battles with players named Lynch, Lewis, Thomas, Bruschi, Fletcher, Dawkins, Seau, Urlacher, Polamalu, Harrison, Woodson and Reed. And with coaches like Fisher, Ryan, Belichick, Kiffin, Phillips, Rivera, LeBeau, Crennel, Capers, Lewis, the late Jim Johnson, and so many more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ll miss that handshake with Tom Brady and I’ll miss the plane rides after a big win with 53 teammates standing in the aisles, laughing and celebrating during the whole flight. I’ll miss playing in front of so many great fans both at home and on the road. I’ll even miss the Patriots fans in Foxborough, and they should miss me because they sure did get a lot of wins off of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a player Peyton Manning was always someone New England fans loved to hate, but now it is time to give Peyton his due, to honor his greatness, and to respect his legacy as one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever put on the uniform.</p>
<p>Bill Belichick was quoted as saying: &#8220;For 18 years, we battled fiercely but regardless of each game&#8217;s outcome, I always walked off the field with the utmost appreciation for the highest level of competition in which those games were prepared for and played. Peyton&#8217;s immense contributions to the game reflect how genuinely passionate he is about it. I can honestly say that I never &#8216;enjoyed&#8217; our meetings, but the respect I have for Peyton Manning as a competitor was, and will likely remain, second to none.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Brady on the Monday Morning Quarterback Show had this to say: “What just happened, winning the Super Bowl in his last game, is a perfect way to end a career. But what he’s accomplished through all these years, what makes it so admirable, is the pressure he’s had on him his whole life. He was the highest-rated recruit in high school. He was the biggest quarterback in college football. He was the first pick in the draft. Who has lived up to the expectations year after year after year as well as Peyton? He’s done it so gracefully, so admirably. He set the standard for how to play the quarterback position.”</p>
<p>The drama provided over the years by the Brady vs Manning match ups has been unbelievable, for so many seasons these two quarterbacks were at the top of their game and their places in history will be forever intertwined. The level of preparation and surgically precise execution as well as competitive fire and Super Bowl contending teams made the contests some of the most well-played and exciting games of the era.</p>
<p>Peyton&#8217;s success can be measured with his statistics and accolades which include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>-Most all-time passing yards: 71,940</p>
<p>-Most all-time passing touchdowns: 539</p>
<p>-Most all-time career wins (regular season and post season): 200</p>
<p>-Most all-time regular season wins: 186 (Tied with Brett Farve)</p>
<p>-Most all-time game-winning drives: 56</p>
<p>-Most all-time Pro Bowl Selections: 14</p>
<p>-Most all-time 4,000+ yard seasons: 14</p>
<p>-Most single season passing yards: 5,477</p>
<p>-Most single season touchdowns: 55</p>
<p>-Most NFL MVP awards: 5-time winner</p>
<p>And the thing that one would imagine Manning is most proud of (even if Eli isn&#8217;t psyched about it) is being a 2-time Super Bowl Champion.</p>
<p>Manning has countless other statistics that are impressive if not the best all-time but what fans can appreciate about Manning is that he was a student of the game and he respected the game as much as anyone who has ever played it.</p>
<p>As much as New England fans have hated Peyton Manning over the years, there is no match up that has been looked forward to more. The conversation of &#8216;who is the better quarterback&#8217; in regards to Brady and Manning has been had in about every sports bar in New England and probably many places around the country. Wherever fans land on this is their own perspective from their own experiences but one thing is for sure both of them could make a case for the best all-time. There has rarely been a television event that is more must-see TV than Brady vs Manning, Patriots vs Colts/Broncos over the last 15 seasons.</p>
<p>Manning finished his speech with this to say: &#8220;When I look back on my NFL career, I’ll know without a doubt that I gave everything I had to help my teams walk away with a win. There were other players who were more talented but there was no one could out-prepare me and because of that I have no regrets.</p>
<p>&#8220;There’s a scripture reading, 2 Timothy 4:7: I have fought the good fight and I have finished the race. I have kept the faith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I’ve fought a good fight. I’ve finished my football race and after 18 years, it’s time. God bless all of you and God bless football.&#8221;</p>
<p>The final touch on the final day of his career was one of class, grace, and respect for the players, the fans, and the game of football.

Blame the O-Line, blame the kicker, blame the play calling from McDaniels, even blame Tom Brady and the ducks he threw up for grabs resulting in two picks. For me, personally, I blame Bill Belichick and Josh McDaniel&#8217;s arrogant play calling in Miami earning the Patriots a week 17 loss and sending them to Denver for the AFC Championship rather than hosting it. The Patriots ran the ball 27 times for 70 yards, averaging 2.6 yards per carry. With multiple 3rd and long plays the coaching staff elected to run the ball and then punt. Only when it was too late did they allow Brady to throw and then the whole plan to protect Brady and establish a run game was out the window with the Dolphins getting pressure on every pass play, running through the Pats porous offensive line and leaving Brady tits up in the backfield for a good portion of the second half. Whoa, now that I got that out, I think I can move on.</p>
<p>The season is over and the grieving process has begun. As part of this process Tom Brady issued a handwritten letter to fans via Facebook. In the letter Brady thanks the fans for all the support over the season and states his pride in calling New England his home. A nice touch from Brady in a tough time for the team and New England fans. The AFC Championship was difficult to watch, with an un-Patriot-like performance allowing for mistakes, turnovers, and lack of execution. Outside of the defense from New England, this will not be a game with many positive things to look back on. Brady and the Pats never gave up, with big conversions down the field and then ultimately in the endzone to Gronkowski there was a glimmer of hope at the end but fell a 2-point conversion short.</p>
<p>Hopefully next season New England fans will once again see the well-oiled machine known as the Patriots offense with a better protection plan for TB12. One thing is for certain, New England will have a new offensive line coach, and, most would imagine, a differently looking offensive line to start next season.</p>
<p>On the upside for Patriot Nation, Tom Brady will return next year with a top notch core of receiving weapons, again be the favorite in the AFC East and a threat to go to Super Bowl 51. That cannot be said for Denver, this may be the last run for Ol&#8217; Peyton Manning. So enjoy the Super Bowl Pat&#8217;s fans, no need to yell at the TV, or holler at whoever is reaching for nachos, blocking the game on a key third down, just enjoy the beer and truck commercials and watch the game like a casual sports fan, you know, like people from outside of New England.</p>

It doesn’t surprise me we’re here again, and it won’t when we get there next year, too (you heard it here first).  And I’m not even worried a smidge about the game being in Denver. Who cares?</p>
<p>People try to compare this thing to the 2014 AFC Championship game. I’m sorry, what? The two are literally incomparable. That game, we had no Gronk or Wilfork, and Welker took out Talib during the game. It was as close as Manning could get to playing against a Junior High School defense. But that’s all in the past. I don’t care anymore. We all know what happened to the lowly Broncos anyways; they got spanked on national television by the Seahawks.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2016/01/23/the-brady-bowl-and-why-peyton-may-be-in-trouble/">The Brady Bowl, and Why Peyton May be in Trouble</a> (293 words)</p>

The Patriots and Broncos have provided fans with some great games over the past few seasons. The championship game brings not just the top two seeded teams in the AFC together but also the top two quarterbacks of this era of football to face each other once again in what is likely the last Brady vs Manning post season match up. With the high stakes of a Super Bowl appearance on the line, the hype of a Brady vs Manning contest, and the pairing of Gronk, Edelman, and Amendola vs the Denver secondary led by Harris Jr, Talib, and the physically dangerous T.J. Ward has also led to some entertaining banter between the teams.</p>
<p>In a SportsCenter interview Tuesday Chris Harris Jr. was asked about stopping Rob Gronkowski, his response was the following: &#8220;You gotta hit him low, man. Hit him in his knees. That&#8217;s the best chance you got of hitting him.&#8221; As many know Gronkowski has had his share of injuries, particularly to his knee dating back to the 2013 ACL and MCL tear precipitated by T.J. Ward&#8217;s untimely contact to the knee at the exact moment Gronk planted his foot in the ground. The hit jarred open the debate of low hits being clean hits as Gronk was sidelined with the season ending injury. Another scare for the big tight end happened on a snowy night this November in the lost to Denver where a shoulder to knee appeared much worse than it actually was and had Gronk and all of New England holding their breath. To be fair to Chris Harris Jr tackling Gronkowski low may be the only way to drag him to the ground. He is too big and strong for most defensive backs to pull down alone and, with speed to out run linebackers if able to get loose, is one of the best yards after contact receivers in the league. Whether Gronkowski actually took offense to the comment about hitting him low or just sounded off in anticipation of the biggest game of the season Gronk responded in a very Gronk way with this double entendre via twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/PaetyWinant">https://twitter.com/PaetyWinant</a>. Without diving into the implied meaning of the duel-edged comment it is clear to see Gronkowski fans and followers will likely have a laugh at the expense of an unappreciative Broncos squad, as tensions between the teams continue to rise heading into Sunday.</p>
<p>With the history of these two post-season giants, a quarterback rivalry dating back over a decade, Gronkowski&#8217;s history and Ward&#8217;s presence the comments made by Harris and response from Gronk have gained a lot of traction in the build up to Sunday&#8217;s game. Ultimately this is probably the least serious thing that will be discussed this week leading up to the game but it is entertaining to see the two sides go at each other and for those following along to have a laugh as the Broncos now have some great white board material. After all it is going to almost necessary as the week rolls on to talk about something other than Brady vs Manning statistics and which analyst picks who as the best quarterback of the era. At this point both signal callers know that success is measured in rings and both will be playing for a chance to get their teams to another Super Bowl and solidify an already established greatness.</p>
