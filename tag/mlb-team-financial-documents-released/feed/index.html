Across MLB, numbers are down ranging from butts in the seats to viewership at home. Boston is a perfect microcosm for the nationwide epidemic. Not even five years removed from their last World Series championship and, seemingly, no one in gives a crap. If you read the papers or listen to any semblance of sports radio you know attendance is down at Fenway plus NESN’s rating are in a tailspin. The pink hats got bored with the actual game and went home. Why?</p>
<p>Well, the laundry lists of reasons why baseball is waning is another conversation. And it’s a lengthy one. Hell, there was an <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2010/08/17/losses_piling_up_lately_for_areas_scalpers_at_fenway_park/" target="_blank">article in the Globe last week about a scalper</a> that’s complaining that he used to make six figures selling Sox tickets now he’s struggling to make $20,000. I almost threw up when I read that article. But really, the scalping system has gotten so bloated in Boston, it&#8217;s strangling the life out of the city’s once vibrant baseball fan base (and that vivid effervescence had nothing to do with the pink hats). Now this guy has the audacity to complain? Please. He’s a victim of his own doing.</p>
<h2>The System is Broken</h2>
<p>In my opinion all this controversy about the recently leaked financial documents brings to light three issues. Number one, this is proof positive that the system is broken. Obviously. Don’t get me wrong: I like no salary cap. It’s quintessential American. If you’ve got the money, spend it. You work your ass off, put out a quality product that people like to see, manage your business and make a boatload. Go for it, spend that dough. I even like revenue sharing. If done right it does even the playing field. But, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to realize that there should be benchmarks set in terms of how much of the revenue sharing money teams need to sink back into the organization. How can that not be obvious? This leads me to my next point.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/08/27/leak-of-mlb-team-financial-reports-just-another-epitaph-on-baseballs-tombstone/">Leak of MLB Team Financial Reports Just Another Epitaph on Baseball&#8217;s Tombstone</a> (324 words)</p>
