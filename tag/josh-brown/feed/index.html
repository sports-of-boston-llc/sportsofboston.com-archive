For the 2-0 New England Patriots: <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?playerId=2330">Tom Brady</a>, entering his eleventh season, holder of records, winner of MVPs and Super Bowls alike. For the 1-1 St. Louis Rams: <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?playerId=13197">Sam Bradford</a>, the #1 draft pick from 2010, primed to start his rookie season. Traditionally, the third preseason game of the NFL is the game that best depicts how a team will play in the regular season. If that&#8217;s the case, then many of the questions fans had coming into the game remained unanswered at its conclusion.</p>
<h2>First Quarter</h2>
<p>The game could not have began better for the Patriots. The Rams kicked off to the New England 3-yard line, where it was caught by wide receiver <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?playerId=12597">Brandon Tate</a>. Some good blocking up front, and Tate was off to the races. Tate wound up going 97 yards to the opposing end-zone, easily beating the kicker. A successful point-after-touchdown, and the Patriots were up 7-0 just 12 seconds into the game.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Patriots&#8217; defense did not respond. They gave up two first downs on the run, then a 32-yard Bradford pass to the New England 18. After short runs and passes moved the ball to the Patriots&#8217; 7-yard line, Bradford completed a 5-yard touchdown pass to <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?playerId=13387">Michael Hoomanawanui</a>. The point-after was good, and the game was tied. The defense looked out-of-sync against both the run and the pass.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/08/27/brown-kicks-game-winning-field-goal-as-rams-win-in-foxboro/">Brown Kicks Game-Winning Field Goal as Rams win in Foxboro</a> (1,444 words)</p>
