<p>The Patriots have announced the signing of tight end <a href="http://www.patriots.com/team/index.cfm?ac=playerbio&amp;bio=32585">Brian Jones</a>, formally of the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Pats also have released tight end Matt Kranchick.</p>
<p>Allen, 25, has played two NFL seasons and signed an undisclosed deal on Sunday. With tight ends <a href="http://www.patriots.com/team/index.cfm?ac=playerbio&amp;bio=28448">Ben Watson</a> and <a href="http://www.patriots.com/team/index.cfm?ac=playerbio&amp;bio=26719">Kyle Brady</a> both nursing injuries, New England needed to bolster its tight end corps for the pre-season. The 6&#8217;3&#8243;, 258 lb Allen is the fifth tight end in camp now and is perceived as a long shot to make the final roster. He has nine career catches for 146 yards and a touchdown.</p>
<p>The Pats held a light walk through practice Sunday at Gillette without pads. A few noticeable attendees were injured wideout <a href="http://www.patriots.com/team/index.cfm?ac=playerbio&amp;bio=6243">Randy Moss</a>, and tight ends Watson and Brady. The only non-injured player absent was cornerback <a href="http://www.patriots.com/team/index.cfm?ac=playerbio&amp;bio=23745">Asante Samuel</a>. No other word has been leaked as to the status of contract negotiations between the Patriots and Samuel.</p>
