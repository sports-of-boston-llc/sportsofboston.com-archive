If you&#8217;re a girl, you like &#8217;em older, wealthier, and more powerful. If you&#8217;re Mark Sanchez, the 24-year-old bachelor quarterback of the New York Jets, you definitely like &#8217;em young. Early on during the &#8220;Hard Knocks&#8221; days, 39-year-old backup quarterback Mark Brunell saw the signs.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a daughter that&#8217;s only five years younger than him (Sanchez was 23 at the time), so that&#8217;s really weird,&#8221; Brunell said, according to the Washington Post. &#8220;No, that won&#8217;t happen. He&#8217;s not meeting my daughter. She already thinks he&#8217;s cute. She saw a picture of him, but that&#8217;s not happening at all. I like the kid, but I don&#8217;t like him that much.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>A superstar quarterback (in terms of stature and popularity, NOT in terms of talent) would never even think of going after a teenager, right? They go after hot twenty-somethings they find at the bars and clubs, known to baseball players as &#8220;<a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/fisherwy/SHOr4s5nf8I/AAAAAAAAPU0/QA130Tx44tg/Picture%20of%20Candice%20Houlihan%20Alex%20Rodriguez%20Sex%20Affair%20Stripper1[3].jpg" target="_blank">slump busters</a>.&#8221; Brunell&#8217;s kid, though, was just 18 (judging by his math), and while he may have been joking, he&#8217;s also a father so he meant it when he said he didn&#8217;t want Sanchez near her. He was right.</p>
