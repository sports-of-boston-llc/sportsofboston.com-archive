The fans have always loved him; he needs just seven wins to break the team&#8217;s career wins record; and figuring out what to do next – every professional athlete&#8217;s most-hated task – gets put off one more year.</p>
<p>But when the Red Sox didn&#8217;t come calling, Wakefield&#8217;s actions spun off into the nonsensical. ESPN.com writer Jerry Crasnick tweeted Wednesday that, at least according to Barry Meister, Wakefield&#8217;s agent, <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/jcrasnick/status/136925446540509184">Wakefield is considering signing with a National League team</a>.</p>
<p>If the tweet is accurate and not just a hypothetical, it makes no sense. Why in God&#8217;s name would Wakefield want to play for another team? And what other team would actually <em>sign</em> him?</p>

Aside from Marco Scutaro and Jed Lowrie competing to be the everyday shortstop, which was uphill for Lowrie in any regard, and the search for a lefty reliever, the 25-man roster was essentially set at the beginning of camp. One issue that remains is the fifth starter. Should it be Tim Wakefield, the emotional choice, trying to finish his career on a high note or should Daisuke Matsuzaka, still trying to find his way in American baseball  remain locked into a rotation spot?</p>
<h2>The Starting 5</h2>
<p>It seems like a long time ago that the 2010 Red Sox rotation was touted as potentially one of the bet ever. Now that the Phillies have taken up that mantle with gusto, the Red Sox starters look somewhat poor by comparison. Josh Beckett and John Lackey, each signed to a large deal for the 2010 season, disappointed last year. Tim Wakefield, in a mix of starting and relieving, looked old and hittable and Daisuke Matsuzaka continued to throw pitches and appear lost or dominant, seemingly at random. On the bright side, Jon Lester established himself as the ace of the staff and Clay Buchholz brought back that magic he showed in his 2007 no-hitter.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2011/03/28/wakefield-matsuzaka-trade-bait-or-fifth-starters/">Wakefield &amp; Matsuzaka: Trade Bait or Fifth Starters?</a> (853 words)</p>

Coming into this All-Star Game, the American League was unbeaten in 13 match-ups (including a tie in 2002), but the National League had the overall better record at 40-38 (2 ties).  Starting for the National League was the Colorado Rockies&#8217; <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=28625">Ubaldo Jimenez</a>, who ended the first half of the season with a 15-1 record and a 2.20 ERA.

<p>Of the six Red Sox players to make the All-Star game, three were eligible to play (though none were starters): pitcher <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=28487">Jon Lester</a>, third baseman <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=3878">Adrian Beltre</a>, and designated hitter <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=3748">David Ortiz</a>, who <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/07/12/live-blog-home-run-derby/">won the Home Run Derby</a> the previous night. Boston&#8217;s other three All-Stars were pitcher <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=28855">Clay Buchholz</a>, second baseman <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=6393">Dustin Pedroia</a>, and catcher <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=5007">Victor Martinez</a>, all of whom were on the DL coming into the All-Star Game.</p>
<h2>The AL Scores First</h2>
<p>In the first half of the All-Star Game, it was all about the pitching, as neither team was able to score.
