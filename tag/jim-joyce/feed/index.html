<p>Through 8.2 innings, the Detroit righty had retired each and every batter he faced. With one out to go, a missed call by the now infamous umpire Jim Joyce cost Galarraga what would have been the third perfect game in only a month and the 21<sup>st</sup> in history.</p>
<p>Talk shows and newspapers were immediately flush with commentary on instant replay and even the possibility of Bud Selig ruling a reversal of the call. The commissioner did in fact meet to discuss both matters the following day. After the meeting, <a href="http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/37479309/ns/sports-baseball/">Selig announced</a> that expanded instant replay will be discussed more in depth in the future, and the missed call was to remain a hit leaving Galarraga with only a great story and perhaps the best perfect game in the history of baseball â€“ if you consider that he used 28 outs, rather than 27.</p>

Instead, the umpire blew the call, and history was foiled. (Image from the Huffington Post)" ></a><p>The NFL has it. The NBA has it. Hell, even the NHL, that red-headed step brother of a professional sports league has it. What is &#8220;it,&#8221; exactly? Expanded instant replay. After a certain gaffe on Wednesday night involving a near-perfect game, it&#8217;s become clearer than ever that Major League Baseball needs to finally step into the 21st century.</p>
<p>The gaffe I speak of is, of course, <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/06/03/armando-galarraga-perfect-game-video-history-ruined/">Jim Joyce&#8217;s inexcusable blown call</a> in the 9th inning of Wednesday night&#8217;s Tigers-Indians game, which robbed Detroit starting pitcher Armando Galarraga of a perfect game. Galarraga was perfect through 8.2 innings, and appeared to have retired Jason Donald on a bang-bang play at first before Joyce inexplicably ruled Donald safe, nullifying Galarraga&#8217;s pursuit of perfection and forcing him to settle for a one-hit shutout. I could sit here all day and pile on Joyce, but I won&#8217;t. He&#8217;s only human, and umpires make mistakes. The problem doesn&#8217;t lie with him. It lies with his employers&#8217; complete inability to adapt to the times.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/06/03/armando-galarraga-perfect-game-lost-by-bad-call-expanded-instant-replay-needed/">Armando Galarraga Perfect Game Lost By Bad Call: Expanded Instant Replay Needed</a> (359 words)</p>
