The event took place just prior to the Red Sox facing the Chicago White Sox.</p>
<p>The recent Hall of Fame Inductee was honored at the ballpark and fans were given a miniature Hall of Fame plaque detailing some of his career statistics as well as player history. During the event a video highlight was shown on the jumbotron giving fans, players, and coaches a chance to admire Pedro&#8217;s supremacy on the mound and his charisma in the dugout and clubhouse. The video also featured Martinez career stats, which got the crowd roaring before he even took the field. So many of the numbers are staggering however a few that got a rise out of those spectating included the following: The 313 strikeouts in 1999, which was Pedro&#8217;s single-season career-high and a Sox franchise record. His 1.74 ERA in 2000, which was ridiculous, keeping in mind the juiced-up players he was fanning on a nightly basis. Then, last but not least, the .760 winning percentage (117-37) with the Red Sox between 1998-2004, best in the majors in that time span.</p>
<p>Martinez, accompanied by his wife and children, waited excitedly as Red Sox legends came out to congratulate him on his accomplishments. It all started with a video message from Nomar Garciaparra, who recalled being inducted into the Latino Hall of Fame with Martinez, he was asked to use two words to describe the sensational ace and said, &#8216;The Best,&#8221; which may simply be the most accurate description.</p>
<p>The ceremony was led by the voice of the Red Sox, Joe Castiglione, who called on Sox greats such as Carl Yastrzemski, Jim Rice, Dwight Evans, Dennis Eckersley, and Carlton Fisk to present Pedro with gifts and memorabilia. One unique gift was a bronze mold, covered in gold, of Pedro&#8217;s huge hands and freakishly long fingers. It was, after all, these fingers that allowed him to force righties out of the batters box, waving at that up and in, high-rising fastball and then make most who faced him look foolish with a one of a kind change up. Martinez was also presented with a laptop computer full of video highlights of his career from teammates Curt Schilling, Trot Nixon and Orlando Cabrera. A special thank you and a call to review &#8216;El Tiante&#8217; Luis Tiant all-time numbers for further accolades was made by Pedro during his speech. He also thanked former Expos manager Felipe Alou as well as Ralph Avila, the scout who first discovered Martinez at a young age in the Dominican Republic. Sox favorite Tim Wakefield made an appearance and presented the Martinez family with a donation to his charity. Pedro also took time for heartfelt gratitude aimed at all the fans in Red Sox Nation.</p>
<p>It was David Ortiz that set in motion the unveiling of #45, which will now forever be a part of Fenway Park and the Red Sox organization and never again be worn by a Sox player. Ortiz spoke to the Fenway Faithful to address Pedro&#8217;s amazing career but also his genuine personality that New England came to fall in love with during his time in Boston.</p>
<p>Before Martinez could finish his speech, he brought out his catcher Jason Varitek to share the moment with him calling it &#8220;his moment, too.&#8221; This was apparently off script as Varitek was to come out for the first pitch, to this Martinez said, &#8220;Hey, this is Pedro,&#8221; and, much to the delight of the crowd, referred to the celebration as &#8220;my party.&#8221; The Hall of Fame pitcher took the mound for the final time in front of a standing ovation as he threw out the first pitch, high and tight of course, to his battery-mate Varitek.</p>
<p>In Pedro&#8217;s career he was voted onto eight All-Star teams, and won three Cy Young Awards while piling up 3,154 strikeouts, 219 wins, and a 2.93 career ERA. Pedro recently received 91.1 percent of the vote to be inducted into the Hall of Fame, joining this years class of baseball legends. Whether it was blowing away the side or taping a player to a post in the dugout, Martinez was as integral a part of the Red Sox as there was at the turn of the millennium. Pedro dazzled all those who watched him with his electric fastball, majestic change-up and infectious smile. His dominance as a pitcher and his leadership in the clubhouse helped Boston reverse the curse and win the 2004 World Series. Pedro&#8217;s role on that team, and the greatness of his Red Sox career will never be forgotten, and now remembering is just as easy as turning your head toward right field.</p>

Over the course of my time as a Boston sports fan, I have noticed many announcers/sports personalities that are completely off in their analysis. This could include why a team is struggling, their insights on a major trade or butchering a widely known players name such as Brad Marchand. With Marchand, it was not until the 2nd game of the Stanley Cup Finals two years ago that the announcers said his name correctly.</p>
<p>Regardless, an unbiased and true commentator brings plenty to the booth and studio, but this list accomplishes the complete opposite.</p>
<h2>10th- ESPN&#8217;S Skip Bayless and Stephen A. Smith</h2>
<p>These two analysts need to be pared together in this list because it is always them I see arguing every morning with one another. Skip and Stephen A. are adults that act like children on the set of ESPN&#8217;S <em>First Take.</em> Stephen A never lets Skip speak, always yelling and telling Skip he is wrong, but then when it is Skip&#8217;s turn to fire back all he does is yell back at Stephen A. with narcissistic and contrarian remarks just to be difficult. Some of the most notable include Skip telling the public that Tim Tebow will be a very good QB (years ago) and still refusing to give LeBron James credit for his play.</p>
<h2>9th- 98.5 Sports Hub&#8217;s Jermaine Wiggins</h2>
<p>Wiggins helped the Patriots win a superbowl years ago, but whenever he visits the Sports Hub, he seems to always be off on his analysis. Just a fair warning, do not get him started on the Bruins, he becomes completely befuddled and but still attempts to break down the Bruins. Wiggins also has one of those voices that you are grateful that is not calling Red Sox games.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2013/06/26/top-10-most-annoying-sports-personalities-of-all-time/">Top 10 Most Annoying Sports Personalities of All Time</a> (602 words)</p>

It was the 11th inning of the six game of what would later be named one of the best World Series of all-time. With Ken Griffey on first and the season on the line, Cincinnati&#8217;s Joe Morgan hits a rocket to right field. A sure hit in any other ballpark, but not Fenway. In Fenway, that ball would have been in the stands. But luckily for the Sox season, one of the best outfielders in the game, Dwight Evans, was there to save the day and make one of the most important plays in Red Sox history. An All-time fan favorite was born.</p>
<h2> An All-Time Fan Favorite</h2>
<p>Johnny Pesky and Bill James would agree that Dwight Evans should be in Cooperstown. The Red Sox right fielder was one of the best players to field that spot in Sox history and one of the most consistent hitters of the 1980s. I&#8217;ve noticed that in the grand scheme of things, being pretty good in the 80s hasn&#8217;t mattered much to Cooperstown voters. It seems as if being great during that decade almost doesn&#8217;t count (see: Jack Morris and Dale Murphy) to the baseball writers.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2012/05/31/is-dwight-evans-a-hall-of-famer-yes/">Is Dwight Evans A Hall Of Famer?

John Lackey had only thrown 91 pitches to that point, so why not bring him back out?

<em>In no particular order…</em></em></p>
<h2>Billy Wagner is traded to the Red Sox</h2>
<p>Despite all of the <a href="../../2009/08/24/the-billy-wagner-jonathan-papelbon-quagmire/">debate</a> this was potentially going to cause, apparently the Red Sox management thought it was worth it to <a href="../../2009/08/25/billy-wagner-traded-to-red-sox/">trade for Billy Wagner</a> and use him as a set-up man. Of course, this possibly means that we should prepare ourselves for fireworks or a tussle in the bullpen – Papelbon is known for getting over-excited about certain things, and he can’t be pleased that anyone is even <em>thinking</em> about taking away his position as a closer.</p>
<h2>With Wagner in the mix, Sox release Brad Penny</h2>
<p>So if the Red Sox wanted to play Billy Wagner before Sept. 1 before the rosters expand (if they want Wagner to play in the playoffs, he needs to be on the active roster before that time), the Red Sox needed to release someone to make room. With <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/08/23/tim-wakefield-to-replace-brad-penny-in-rotation/">Tim Wakefield back in the starting rotation</a> and <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/08/27/ortiz-and-sox-walk-off-win-3-2/">pitching well</a>, the Red Sox <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/08/27/brad-penny-requests-and-is-granted-release-from-red-sox/">parted ways with the slumping Bad Penny</a> (that&#8217;s not a misspelling). He was pretty decent in the first half but has fallen off a cliff since then with just one win in his last 11 starts. Rumor has it that three NL teams are interested in Penny&#8230;and who knows, he&#8217;ll probably pitch better than John Smoltz did in his first outing with the Cardinals. Speaking of which&#8230;(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/08/27/wagner-joins-red-sox-big-papi-back-to-hitting-walk-offs/">Wagner Joins Red Sox, Big Papi Back to Hitting Walk-Offs</a> (274 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/llws09/news/story?id=4414291">Former Red Sox player and Hall of Famer, Jim Rice</a>, currently finds himself amidst a self-created controversy for singling out Manny Ramirez, Alex Rodriguez, and Derek Jeter as bad influences on America’s youth while at the Little League World Series this past weekend. Rice compared current MLB players to those of his generation, citing that “dread locks and baggy clothes” contribute to the “bad example” that these players set. </p>
<p>Since when do athletes having dreadlocks cause a negative influence on children? Does an athlete’s hairstyle have that much power? Children did not run to grocery stores to buy green and pink hair dye when they saw <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/players/stats?playerId=726">Dennis Rodman</a> playing for the Bulls. There are plenty of other current professional athletes who sport dreadlocks or long hair, such as Pittsburgh Steelers safety, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?playerId=4474">Troy Polamalu</a>. Is he also a bad influence on children? No. A child is not going to join a gang or meddle in drugs just because he sees an athlete with dreadlocks and baggy pants at a baseball game.<br />

<p>In no particular order…</p>
<h2>David Ortiz named for using performance enhancing drugs</h2>
<p>The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/31/sports/baseball/31doping.html?_r=1">reported on Thursday morning</a> that David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez were some of the players who <a href="../../2009/07/30/manny-ramirez-and-david-ortiz-tested-positive-for-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-2003/">tested positive in 2003</a> for taking performance enhancing drugs. There will be way <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/extras/extra_bases/2009/07/report_ortiz_ra.html">more backlash to follow</a>, I’m sure – but at this point, am I surprised? Not really. Nobody wants to hear that a Red Sox player has used steroids, least of all David Ortiz, but it seems like the government is just out to get as many athletes as they can. There are at least 100 players on the list who have tested positive in 2003, so who’s next? With any luck there will be another list to appear soon that will have 100 more names… until everyone gets sick of the whole issue and moves on. Oh, and this doesn’t make me pro-steroid use, but I think people are getting a little too carried away right now.</p>
<h2>Daisuke Matsuzaka blames the Red Sox pitching staff for his problem</h2>
<p><strong> </strong>Really, Dice-K? You’re <a href="../../2009/07/29/rolling-the-dice-on-dice-k%E2%80%99s-arm/">telling the whole world</a> that the Red Sox rehab program is the reason that you’ve pitched a miserable 2009 season and found yourself stuck on the DL? Interesting theory. Yes, we all know Japanese baseball is different, and yes, it probably works very well… if you’re playing in Japan. We’re in America now, Dice-K realized this when he came to the Red Sox. Welcome to the American standards of baseball playing, which includes its own pitching and rehab regimens. But, even if Dice-K was allowed to throw more pitches, or pitch more innings, he’s trying to tell us that his arm would magically be healed? Give me a break&#8230;or at least come up with a better excuse.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/07/30/david-ortiz-and-peds-matsuzaka-shifts-the-blame/">David Ortiz and PEDs, Matsuzaka Shifts the Blame</a> (278 words)</p>

<p>Rice’s No. 14 will be the seventh Red Sox number retired and eighth overall, following the league-wide retiring of Jackie Robinson’s No. 42.  His number will be placed on the Fenway Walls alongside Bobby Doerr (1), Joe Cronin (4), Johnny Pesky (6), Carl Yastrzemski (8), Ted Williams (9) and Carlton Fisk (27).</p>
<p>Rice is third in Red Sox history in hits, home runs, and RBI behind both Yaz and Williams respectfully.  He will now join his fellow leftfielders in two highly selective groups, starting with Cooperstown and then in Boston.  They are both just reminders of the impact Rice has had on not just the Red Sox, but in the game of baseball himself.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/07/23/red-sox-to-retire-jim-rices-number/">Red Sox to Retire Jim Rice&#8217;s Number</a> (443 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Monday afternoon, and more than 20 years after his career ended, <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/r/riceji01.shtml">Jim Rice</a> was <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/01/12/jim-rice-to-the-hall-of-fame/">finally elected to Major League Baseball&#8217;s Hall of Fame</a>. He became only the third player to ever be elected on his last try, joining Red Ruffing (1967) and Ralph Kiner (1975). He received barely enough to be elected, appearing on just 412 of 539 total ballots for 76.4% of the vote, surpassing the required 75%.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Jim Rice, as he was tortured for far too long about the process. But, does Rice really deserve to have his plaque hanging in Cooperstown? Was he a Hall of Fame player during his career? After a long hard look at his numbers, a few SoB staff writers are split.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/01/13/is-jim-rice-a-hall-of-famer/">Rice a Deserved Hall of Famer?</a> (472 words)</p>
