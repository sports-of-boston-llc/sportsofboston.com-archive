(boston.com)" ></a><p>Sophomore RB Josh Haden and Redshirt Freshman QB Justin Tuggle have both decided to transfer from Boston College today. Both have seen less and less playing time as the year has gone on.</p>
<h3>Justin Tuggle lost the starting QB job and apparently fell to at least third on the depth chart</h3>
<p>Although never said it out loud, the Tuggle transfer seemed imminent with him sitting third on the depth chart recently after starting the first three games. Tuggle’s athleticism was his greatest asset at QB, but he was never accurate and had a tendency to heave down field jump balls even when no one was open. In his first two games against Kent State and Northeastern, he threw for 206 yards and three touchdowns, but against Clemson he fell apart on a dismal 4-20 outing with three interceptions. When true Freshman Mike Marscovetra came in to replace a struggling Dave Shinskie against Virginia Tech instead of Tuggle, it looked like Tuggle’s window of opportunity at BC shut. Even after a rough performance by Shinskie against a weak Notre Dame defense, Tuggle was no longer confident in his chances to succeed at Boston College. Highly touted incoming QB Chase Rettig would have put Tuggle in an even further hole next year if he stayed.</p>
<h3>Montel Harris&#8217; stellar play earning him most of the touches</h3>
<p>What caused more of a stir was the move of Haden from Chestnut Hill. After coming in as the key recruit of the Jeff Jagodzinski era (spurning offers from Florida, Michigan, and Ohio State), Jagodzinski handed Haden the starting spot as a true freshman. Jags believed Haden fit the mold of a fast pass catching tailback perfectly, which fit into then offensive coordinator Steve Logan’s spread offense. Lightly recruited and ex-Duke commit Montel Harris quickly earned a spot in the rotation and ended up gaining 421 more yards on 59 more carries. He had more receiving yards. The duo ended up second in the nation for freshman running back tandem and carried that chemistry into this year with Montel Harris changing his number from 42 to 2 to literally become a 1-2 tandem with Haden.</p>
<p>Harris ran wild this season (with the exception of the Wake Forest game) and, after dominating the Florida State game, never looked back. Haden is currently averaging 1.4 yards less per carry than Haden and 1.1 yards less than promising true freshman Rolandan Finch. His tendency to dance in the backfield and inability to break tackles has greatly hampered his play. Josh Haden’s brother Joe currently plays on the Florida Gators and is one of the top corners in the nation.</p>
<p>Head Coach Frank Spaziani wished both players well.</p>

(AP Photo/Don Petersen)" ></a><p>After BC&#8217;s debacle at Virginia Tech, they look forward to a visit from Tom O&#8217;Brien and the NC State Wolfpack. Here are some observations from last week.</p>
<h3>Despite a horrendous day at quarterback, Dave Shinskie looks like he will start again</h3>
<p>A few players say they see no need to change QBs and that the offensive line’s lack of protection had just as much to do with the terrible performance as did Shinskie’s play. For the record, Shinskie threw twelve passes with only one completion to his own team and two to Virginia Tech. The pick-six Shinskie threw in his red zone was unforgivable as he stared down his receiver the entire play and everyone in the stadium knew where it was going. This recurring problem should trouble Eagle fans as he doesn’t have the presence of mind to check down to other receivers or is under too much pressure and does not have enough time to throw to anyone else. If the latter is the problem, why not put QB Justin Tuggle in to buy some time?  Wasn’t Tuggle benched for putting up the same type of performance at Clemson? It seems a little unfair to give Shinskie a longer leash.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/10/15/five-eagle-eyed-thoughts-on-week-6/">Five Eagle Eyed Thoughts on Week 6</a> (462 words)</p>

(AP Photo/Mary Ann Chastain)" ></a><p>Here are five reactions to this week&#8217;s BC game against Clemson.</p>
<h2>The quarterback position now belongs to Justin Tuggle</h2>
<p>Despite throwing for a magnificent two yards in the first half on 2-7 passing, Tuggle remained in the game for ninety percent of the snaps with Dave Shinskie getting very limited snaps. On Shinskie’s first snap in the second quarter he fumbled and things did not get much better afterwards. Hopefully, Shinskie can either fight the good fight pushing Tuggle to improve or he could pull a Codi Boek and become a fullback. Either way, Frank Spaziani looks like he has chosen his guy: a guy who threw 20 passes with four completions, totaling 23 yards and an interception.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/09/24/five-eagle-eyed-thoughts/">Five Eagle Eyed Thoughts</a> (340 words)</p>

<h3>The Eagles running attack looked weak</h3>
<p>RBs Montel Harris and Josh Haden combined for twenty-seven carries and ninety-eight yards. The offensive line never got a push of the line of scrimmage even though RT Rich Lapham came back from a neck injury that kept him out of the Northeastern game. I understand that Kent State DTs Aaron Hull and Sam Frist are some of the better MAC players, but this is unacceptable for one of the better offensive lines in the ACC. If Boston College has any chance against an impressive Clemson team, it needs the running game to set up the passing game in a hostile Death Valley.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/09/15/five-eagle-thoughts-for-week-2/">Five Eagle Thoughts for Week 2</a> (381 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On a dreary New England day, Boston College jumped past Kent State by leaps and bounds. Despite never consistently gaining yards through the ground with 150 yards on 37 carries, Boston College came alive on the backs of receivers Rich Gunnell and Colin Larmond, Jr. The Boston College defense, which Coach Frank Spaziani calls “a work in progress”, also managed to shut down the nation’s leader in total offense, RB Eugene Jarvis, to 25 yards.</p>
<p>LB Luke Kuechly led the team with five tackles for a defense that allowed their first touchdown of the season in the final five minutes. DT Damik Scaife and DT Austin Giles helped clog up the line and gave Jarvis no room to run. The Boston College defense also hurt their second quarterback of the year in Giorgio Morgan.</p>
