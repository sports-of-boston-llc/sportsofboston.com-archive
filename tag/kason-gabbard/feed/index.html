				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Red Sox are definitely the hottest team in baseball. They have now won nine out of ten games after an 8-3 victory over the Rangers at Fenway. Clay Buchholz had a very strong outing after a few shaky ones, going six strong innings and allowing zero runs on five hits and two walks. He struck out six.</p>
<p>The Sox bats were also the story, even though the lineup was without Jason Varitek, Mike Lowell, and Manny Ramirez. They touched Texas pitching for eight runs over a two-inning span in the fourth and fifth innings. Former Sox lefty Kason Gabbard lasted just two innings, but he allowed no runs. He left the game with back stiffness, and what a shame for the Rangers. His replacement was terrible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night&#8217;s game between the Texas Rangers and the Baltimore Orioles was historic. When I first came upon the score at Yahoo Sports, I thought that the score being shown was a glitch. I only thought this because several times when I check box scores on yahoo to see how my fantasy team did, the scores are messed up and players have outrageous numbers (I remember when Edgar Renteria apparently went 1 for 16 in a single game).</p>
<p>However, this was no glitch. Instead it was an annihilation. The Texas Rangers set an AL record by scoring 30 runs in a single game on Wednesday night, they were the first team in over 100 years to score that many runs.</p>
<p>Part of history were two former Red Sox players. Kason Gabbard and David Murphy, who were traded for Eric Gagne at the trade deadline, contributed to the record breaking game.</p>
<p>Gabbard&#8217;s line for the night was: 6IP, 3ER, 3K and a win to put his record at 6-1 on the season with a 3.64 ERA. Since being dealt to Texas, Gabbard is 2-1 with a respectable 3.51 ERA.</p>
<p>David Murphy, who has yet to find an everyday job in Texas,  had the most hits out of any Ranger in the lineup by going 5-7 and collecting two RBI and five runs. Even though he doesn&#8217;t play everyday, Murphy is hitting .579 with 11 hits in nine games as a Ranger.</p>
<p>Fantasy owners beware, do not let this amazing offensive feat impede your judgment. Owners hoping to add some pop to their lineup should not go out and add the starting nine from Texas. In this case, lets just congratulate two former Boston players for contributing to the biggest offensive output we have ever witnessed.</p>
<p>Just for fun: odds are you do not own any Texas player on offense except for SS Michael Young (who currently stands at .306, 7HR, 67 RBI). Young was 2-5 on the night but, even though Texas drove in 30 runs, Michael Young had zero RBI. I will repeat that: ZERO, ZILCH, NADA, ZIP runs batted in. So the one Ranger that is universally owned did not help your fantasy team gain much ground.</p>
<p>Young did however get an RBI in the second game of that doubleheader.</p>
