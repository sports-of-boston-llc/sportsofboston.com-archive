				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Originally tapped to join the Yankees, among other teams, as a fourth outfielder this season, Rocco Baldelli has re-joined the Tampa Bay Rays. No, he will not be patrolling the outfield at Tropicana as he did from 2003-2008. Instead, due to a variety of ailments that have plagued him throughout his career, Baldelli will join Tampa as a special assistant.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Obviously we&#8217;re thrilled to add Rocco and his experience and what he can bring to our young players,&#8221; Rays vice president Andrew Friedman said, according to the St. Petersburg Times. &#8220;We think he&#8217;ll be a tremendous asset for us. And he looks better in blue.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the Times, Baldelli will miss the 2010 season due to a shoulder injury, but claims he&#8217;s not &#8220;ready to retire.&#8221; Friedman later said that he would not rule out Baldelli rejoining the Rays as a player later in the season.</p>
<p>Baldelli was diagnosed with channelopathy prior to the 2008 season, a disorder that prevents him from being an everyday player in the major leagues. He was regarded as a top prospect during his upbringing, and had a strong first year in the majors with the &#8220;Devil&#8221; Rays: 156 games, .289 AVG, 11 HR, 78 RBI, 89 Runs, 27 stolen bases.</p>
<p>His career went downhill after that, and culminated in his first year as a fourth outfielder last season with the Red Sox. Baldelli played just 62 games with the Sox, finishing with 7 HR, 23 RBI, and a .253 AVG.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/03/02/rocco-baldelli-not-ready-to-retire-joins-rays-as-assistant/">Rocco Baldelli &#8220;Not Ready to Retire,&#8221; Joins Rays as Assistant</a> (188 words)</p>

<h2>Rocc-ow</h2>
<p>Fewer fourth outfielders have received the attention or support Rocco Baldelli has as the native son came home to play for his Boston Red Sox.  He left Tampa Bay, but the injury bug followed him up north.  As a backup for the also fragile J.D. Drew, Rocco was a questionable choice to begin with, but upside and low dollars gave the Red Sox reason to hope for a great bargain.  Baldelli put up a .253/.311/.433/.744 line over 150 at bats, but did not have the kind of breakout or return to glory the fans would have liked to see.  While Baldelli may yet re-sign with the Red Sox, he is now three years removed from his breakout <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/baldero01.shtml">2006 season</a> and is still unfortunately dealing with health issues.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/11/30/red-sox-hot-stove-back-burner/">Red Sox Hot Stove: Back Burner</a> (451 words)</p>

<p><span> </span>The offense for the Red Sox was slow but steady, getting exactly one run in each of the first four innings, causing Jays ace Roy Halladay to have another lackluster start. Included in that total is a home run to left by Rocco Baldelli in the 2nd; Baldelli was filling in for <a href="http://browniepoints.mlblogs.com/archives/2009/08/bay_takes_a_breather_against_d.html" target="_new">Jason Bay</a>, who had the night off. The Jays would try to answer in the 3rd, loading the bases with two outs via two straight walks, but could not capitalize.</p>

Alex Gonzalez doubled to lead off, then Jacoby Ellsbury reached on a bunt single, which included some interesting backspin. Dustin Pedroia grounded to the new pitcher Shawn Camp, who threw to third to attempt to pick off Gonzalez instead of looking him back and getting Pedroia out. The result was a throwing error that bounced off a wall into shallow left, allowing both runners to score and Pedroia to reach second.

Neither series went exactly as the Sox wanted and they suffered their worst week of the season to date by losing six games in a row to both the Rays and Yankees.</p>
<p>They now see themselves staring up at the first place Yankees while they sit in second place, back six and a half games before play on Monday night.</p>
<h2>1. Bye Bye John Smoltz</h2>
<p>The Red Sox gave up their attempt to get former All-Star John Smoltz back into form this season after he had surgery on his shoulder last season. Smoltz was <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/08/07/john-smoltz-designated-for-assignment/">designated for assignment</a> after his <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/08/07/yanks-bats-blast-sox-13-6/">terrible start against the Yankees</a> on Thursday night. Smoltz finished the season with the Sox going 2-5 with an 8.33 ERA with 33 strikeouts. Smoltz is still optimistic about staying with the Red Sox in a possible minor league arrangement.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/08/11/sox-suffer-through-worst-week-of-the-season/">Sox Suffer Through Worst Week of the Season</a> (660 words)</p>

<p>The Red Sox were poor in all phases of the game today, <strong>losing 6-2</strong> at Toronto. The bats? Boston was 1-12 with runners in scoring position. The pitching? Brad Penny was woeful, giving up eight hits and six earned runs through five innings, and should have been pulled earlier than he was. The defense? Jed Lowrie inexplicably failed to heed Mike Lowell&#8217;s call for a fly ball and clumsily knocked it away from the third baseman, who had the angle. George Kottaras also gave up an embarrassing passed ball.</p>
<p>Things looked hopeful early on, as the Sox took a 1-0 lead in the second inning on a single from Rocco Baldelli, starting for Jacoby Ellsbury, who was out of the lineup with what Terry Francona vividly described as <a href="http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/yb/133106500">&#8220;intestinal turmoil.&#8221;</a> But the Jays would tie it up in the same inning on a bases-loaded double-play grounder by Kevin Millar.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/07/18/wasteful-red-sox-squander-chances/">Wasteful Red Sox Squander Chances</a> (219 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Josh Beckett took the mound in the fourth inning with a 4-1 lead, and had really stifled the Phillies to that point. Then, he unraveled in the inning, and forked over the lead as a three-run lead became a one-run deficit. An angry Beckett violently threw his glove into the dugout, and grabbed his bat for the next half inning. He was due up.</p>
<p>Perhaps using his anger to his benefit, Beckett smacked his second HR in a Sox uniform to left-center field, tying the game and taking himself off the hook&#8230;for the moment. The Sox ace just didn&#8217;t have his best stuff Sunday afternoon, and after a scoreless sixth inning, he allowed two more runs and received no help from the bullpen in a <strong>11-6 loss</strong>.</p>
<p>All was not lost Sunday. Through their four consecutive series against first place clubs (Tigers, Rangers, Yankees, Phillies), the Red Sox went a remarkable 9-3, so they definitely have something to hang their hat on.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/06/14/beckett-hr-not-enough-to-sweep-phillies/">Beckett HR Not Enough to Sweep Phillies</a> (176 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Red Sox will look to avoid a sweep today at the hands of the Blue Jays, just a week after completing a sweep of the Jays in Fenway Park. On the mound for the Sox will be Jon Lester, who needs to avoid allowing the big inning. In his last start, he tossed four scoreless innings before allowing five runs in the fifth inning, in a loss against the Twins.</p>
<p>Saturday afternoon, the Blue Jays banged out 14 hits but only managed five runs. Brad Penny managed to string together another solid outing, allowing three runs (two earned) on 10 hits with five strikeouts in six innings pitched. The usually untouchable Ramon Ramirez was touched with the loss, as the righthander allowed two runs on three hits and a walk in just 2/3 of an inning.</p>
<p>The Red Sox only mustered together four hits and three earned runs, making a winner out of Toronto starter Brian Tallet, who went seven innings and allowed three runs in a <strong>5-3 Jays victory</strong>.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/05/31/jays-win-5-3-sox-look-to-avoid-sweep/">Jays Win 5-3, Sox Look to Avoid Sweep</a> (150 words)</p>
