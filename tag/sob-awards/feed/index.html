During the regular season alone, Big Papi hit .309 with 30 homers and two triples, the latter being amazing for someone with just about no speed. Still, Ortiz set a new personal best with four steals on the year as well, and was also intentionally walked a career high 27 times.</p>
<p>We all know how monstrous Papi performed in the World Series (.688 average to go along with eight walks), but that overshadows an ALCS line of just 2/22 with one homer and three walks. Still, there&#8217;s nobody Boston would rather have at the plate with the game on the line than David Ortiz.<br />

In the end, the Patriots showed the biggest grit and determination in a situation that was perhaps closer to impossible than any other game. Turning the ball over on their first three possessions and down 24-0 at halftime, the Pats didn&#8217;t look good. They also punted twice, turned the ball over on downs, and got off a singular desperation pass before halftime. Many were trying to beat the traffic or find something decent on TV to escape the pain. Boy were they sorry.</p>
<p>In the second half, four touchdowns to start, followed a field goal propelled New England to an improbable lead, before one last touchdown by Denver with just over three minutes left forced overtime. And that&#8217;s where the fun really began.<br />

<p>As is often the case, sports helped the city to persevere through tough times. The Red Sox played their first game after the bombings on Saturday, April 20, after Friday&#8217;s game was postponed due to the city-wide manhunt for the suspects. David Ortiz delivered an emotional speech before the game, a 4-3 victory over Kansas City, and became a leading figurehead in the team&#8217;s World Series championship.<br />

It was the first one on the road, and the home team won all six previous games in the final round. However, Vancouver struggled at home all series long and never bothered to show up in Boston. Boston took advantage and finally broke through for the 4-0 shutout in the deciding game. Could it have been Nathan Horton pouring water from melted TD Garden ice on Vancouver&#8217;s rink before the game? That&#8217;s probably Vancouver&#8217;s excuse.</p>
<p>Patrice Bergeron and Brad Marchand each score twice in a game that featured more goals than penalties. Tim Thomas was excellent in net, stopping all 37 shots on goal to help seal the cup. It was Boston&#8217;s first Cup in 39 years, making Boston a hockey town again.<br />

Boston found themselves tied with Tampa on the season&#8217;s final day. All they had to do to stay in the hunt was beat the Orioles, one of the easiest feats in baseball.</p>
<p>They took a 3-2 lead into the 9th inning, when Jonathan Papelbon threw his last pitches for the team. He got the first two batters swinging, but then gave up three straight hits to blow the save (again) and the season. Tampa won the same night over the Yankees, 8-7, in 12 innings.</p>
<p>Now, Papelbon and John Lackey are gone through free agency and injury respectively. The bullpen is undergoing major retooling, as is the starting rotation and managerial and front office positions. With their power-packed offense (less Carl Crawford, of course), the Red Sox should fulfill their potential in 2012 as long as the new pitching works out.<br />
