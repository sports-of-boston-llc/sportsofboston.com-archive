When it came to the Red Sox, some might have said Mookie Betts or Xander Bogaerts, but Schoenfield listed Yoan Moncada as the Sox&#8217;s most untradeable player. Moncada would command a king&#8217;s ransom at the deadline, and he is certainly a player that the Sox will be hoping to use next season. When the Cuban signed for $31.5 million, few were expecting him to rise as quickly as he did to Double-A ball, but the 21 year old has shown he is already worth the huge amount of cash.</p>
<p>Moncada is listed as the number 5 prospect in Major League Baseball, and his scouting report draws comparisons to Robinson Cano (with more speed). Paired with Andrew Benintendi, the number 21 overall prospect, the future in Boston is bright.</p>
<p>So, where does that leave the Red Sox next year? Some players and their positions are set in stone, such as Bogaerts at shortstop and JBJ in center. The areas of need, if one is to nitpick, would be left field, third base, and first base.</p>

It might be easy to say that it&#8217;s not surprising that Buchholz struggled against a Rangers team with the best record in the American League, especially with how Buchholz&#8217;s season has gone this year. But John Farrell used his faith in Buchholz to justify not bringing up a reliever from Pawtucket a night after <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8185&amp;position=P">Steven Wright</a> did not make it out of the fifth inning, and two nights after <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=3184&amp;position=P">David Price</a> didn&#8217;t make it out of the third. Most Red Sox fans already knew that faith was misguided, and were not surprised when Buchholz allowed the first six batters he faced to reach base, putting giving the Rangers an immediate lead they would not give up. Buchholz also walked more batters (5) than he struck out (3), further illustrating why he was demoted to the bullpen earlier in the season. Sadly the Red Sox find themselves thin on options as far as starting pitching is concerned, but there really is no reason to send Buchholz back out for another start. He has had more than his fair share of chances in Boston, and he has proven that the only thing he can be counted on to do is under-perform.</p>
<p>A few more notes from Sunday&#8217;s game:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=10607&amp;position=OF">Bryce Brentz</a> went 2-for-3 with a solo homer, the first of his Major League career. It will be interesting to see if the Red Sox try to get Brentz some playing time in Left Field going forward, as his bat could be starting to heat up. His main competition in Left, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=10700&amp;position=OF">Ryan LaMarre</a>, has done absolutely nothing with the bat since coming up from Pawtucket, so there should be plenty of playing time available for whoever is performing at the moment.</li>

Meanwhile Ortiz and Bogaerts both lead the AL with votes in their positions. But these are not the only three Sox players that may make the All-Star game this July.</p>
<h2>Potential Sox Players to Make ASG:</h2>
<ul>
<li>DH David Ortiz</li>
<li>SS Xander Bogaerts</li>
<li>OF Jackie Bradley Jr.</li>
<li>OF Mookie Betts</li>
<li>2B Dustin Pedroia</li>
<li>1B Hanley Ramirez</li>
<li>3B Travis Shaw</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sox have a chance a pretty good chance to bring a decent amount of players to the All-Star game, but it shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise to anyone. The Red Sox are the best hitting team in the MLB. They are first in runs (342), hits (610), doubles (152), total bases (1015), RBIs (329), AVG. (.290), OBP (.355), SLG (.482), and OPS (.837). They lead in almost every major offensive statistic so it wouldn&#8217;t be a shocker if half of the starting lineup ends up All-Stars this season. At one point during the season, six of the nine starting players were batting over .300 which is ridiculous. These guys are proving that they are a dominant force on the offensive side and they are really trying to make a name for themselves this year.</p>
<p>Now their pitching is another story. Everyone knows that Boston&#8217;s weakest part of their game is their pitching. But they do have some solid pitching from David Price, Rick Porcello, and Stephen Wright. If any pitchers from the Sox were going to make the All-Star game, I would have to say it would only be Porcello. He is 7-2 on the season with a 4.04 ERA. But I honestly don&#8217;t think Porcello will make it. If he had another win or two and had a lower ERA then yes he probably would make the team.</p>
<p>This time of year is looking very different from where the Sox were last year. The only player from Boston to make the All-Star game was Brock Holt. Now Holt has been hurt for a while with a concussion so we haven&#8217;t seen him so he&#8217;s out of the question for this year&#8217;s game. But to go from one All-Star to potentially four, five, maybe even six All-Stars in one year is a huge improvement.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how the voting ballots end up and who leads in each category. I want to see our players at the top of the food chain come July. But its up to <strong>YOU</strong> Boston fans to cast your vote and get our boys to the All-Star game. So head on over to MLB.com and vote! You can vote a total of 35 times total and five times a day. If I could vote 35 times a day I would but I also have no life so that&#8217;s just me.</p>
<p>Happy Voting</p>

In a match-up with one of the very best in the game in Madison Bumgarner, Price was as sharp as he&#8217;s been all season long, spotting his fastball and making quick work of an opportunistic Giant&#8217;s lineup. The only problem? The Red Sox offense, who has carried Price through his lackluster start of the season with tremendous run support, forgot to show up.</p>
<p>John Farrel has to take the lion&#8217;s share of the blame, as he made what I believed to be a huge blunder in the final inning. With men on first and second and just one out, the struggling Travis Shaw was due up to bat. Shaw has looked absolutely lost at the plate as of late, and Farrel should have pinch hit Rutledge or Hernandez for Shaw in this spot. Instead, Farrell elected to take the bat out of the hands of the hottest hitter on the team in Chris Young, and Shaw struck out on a breaking ball in the dirt.</p>
<p>Let me be clear- I am not among the contingency who believe that the Sox are winning despite John Farrell. I think he&#8217;s done a fine job this season, and he&#8217;s earned the right to be at the helm through the playoff push. But some of his in-game decisions this year have been baffling to say the least, and it&#8217;s going to catch up with him at some point or another.</p>
<p>While the loss was certainly frustrating, my big takeaway was the performance of the man brought in to be the ace of this staff.  Price looked like the confident, controlled pitcher we all remember from his days of mowing down lineups in Tampa and Detroit, and he outlasted one of the baseball&#8217;s elite in Bumgarner last night. He got stronger as the game went on, with his fastball touching 95 as late as the 7th and 8th ininngs. Once again, Price was once again done-in by the long ball, which has been the crux of his struggles all season long.</p>
<p>So yeah, the Sox split the mini-series with the Giants, but this series may ultimately be remembered as the moment when David Price found &#8220;it&#8221; for the first time in a Red Sox uniform. Despite their potent lineup, the Sox won&#8217;t be a true contender without a dominant Price come October.</p>

The back up third baseman will be sidelined for the remainder of the season and is expected to make a full recovery for the 2017 season.</p>
<p>Sandoval came to Boston in 2015 with very high hopes of becoming a franchise player. He signed a five year, $95 million deal with the Sox in late 2014. Sandoval had a disappointing first season with the Red Sox as he posted a .245 batting average (worst of his career), 10 home runs, and 47 RBIs.</p>
<p>After the 2015 season, Sox fans everywhere were left wondering what the team was going to do with Sandoval. The questions raised when word came out of Hanley Ramirez moving from the outfield to first base. Also rookie Travis Shaw made a very good impression at first base and at the plate in the 65 games he played so questions of where he was going to be placed raised as well.</p>
<p>By the time spring training came around in March, we learned that it would be a battle between Sandoval and Shaw for the starting third base position. Sandoval collected 10 hits in 49 plate appearances (.204 avg.). Meanwhile Travis Shaw collected 22 hits in 65 plate appearances (.338 avg.) It was clear who won the starting job. Sandoval came into spring training over weight and not ready for the season so he lost the job that he was so heavily paid for.</p>
<p>With the latest news of Sandoval&#8217;s surgery, the biggest question is what&#8217;s his future in Boston? Through 26 games this season, Travis Shaw has posted a .312 batting average and .516 slugging percentage, among one of the highest on the team. Shaw seems like he might be at third base to stay. But the Red Sox seem fully committed to getting Sandoval healthy and ready for the 2017 season. But are they better off with him or without him?</p>
<p>There is a possibility that Sandoval could take up the DH spot with David Ortiz retiring after this season. The DH position seems like the only way Sandoval could see the field in a Red Sox uniform at this point. But from what we&#8217;ve seen, he has not put up any decent numbers at the plate with Boston. Some may say it&#8217;s due to his weight problem and that very well might be the problem but either way something has to change. I mean this guy is a former World Series MVP and has won three world series championships with the San Francisco Giants where he was the stud third baseman, he&#8217;s got the skills but he just hasn&#8217;t produced yet. Maybe it&#8217;s his transition from San Francisco to Boston. Sometimes it&#8217;s tough to transition to a new team. There was so much hype around his name and he was expected to be big for the Sox so the pressure may have got to him. I believe there&#8217;s a possibility that Sandoval comes back next season much healthier and lives up to the hype.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a possibility that the Red Sox try to trade Sandoval but I feel like this is less possible to happen considering the amount of money they owe him. I don&#8217;t know how many teams will be willing to pay him that contract with the results he&#8217;s produced in the past season.</p>
<p>Bottom line the only thing stopping him is himself. If Pablo wants to be an everyday player for the Sox, he needs to take his rehab, workout program, and diet seriously. He&#8217;s a professional athlete and needs to be responsible for his body. The Red Sox did not pay him $95 million to ride the pine. They paid him to help turn this franchise around and become contenders in October again.</p>
<p>All that being said I hope Pablo&#8217;s recovery goes well and he gets healthy. I really want to see him turn this around and live up to his name. When he signed with the Sox at the end of the 2014 season, I was ecstatic and nothing would make me happier than seeing him in the lineup and executing at the plate.</p>

Should they? (AP)" ></a><p>With Opening Day a week away, the Boston Red Sox are having an organizational meeting on Monday to start setting the 25-man roster. In addition to determining the fifth starter to replace the injured Eduardo Rodriguez and filling out the bullpen, Dave Dombrowski and John Farrell have an interesting decision to make regarding the fate of outfielder David Murphy.</p>
<p>After receiving little interest in the offseason, Murphy signed a minor league deal with the Red Sox that included an opt out date to allow him to become a free agent and sign with another major league ball club. That opt out date was Sunday, and Murphy exercised it rather than risk spending time in his 11th season playing at Triple-A Pawtucket, waiting to be called up.</p>
<p>Now the Red Sox have until Tuesday to either let Murphy walk or add him to the 25-man roster for Opening Day. What should they do with the 34-year-old veteran?(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2016/03/28/david-murphy-opts-out-should-the-red-sox-opt-in/">David Murphy Opts Out; Should the Red Sox Opt In?</a> (539 words)</p>

The good part about that plan is that Ramirez can’t possibly be worse at first than he was in Left Field in 2015, so there is nowhere to go but up. One aspect of this move that seems to have gone unnoticed is the status of incumbent First baseman <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=11982&amp;position=1B">Travis Shaw</a>.</p>
<p>Shaw played well in his limited sample of plate appearances in 2015, but it appears that there is not much room for him to take an expanded role on the 2016 Red Sox. This may actually be a positive for now, as Shaw’s success last season surprised just about everyone, given his lack of flashy tools and mediocre minor league numbers (.249/.318/.356 in Triple-A in 2015). In fact, Shaw finished the season hitting fifth in the Red Sox order and was relied upon as one of their better run producers in the month of September, yet is still going into the 2016 season without a major role. Is this because the Red Sox basically had nowhere else to put Ramirez defensively, or because they do not believe Shaw can sustain his breakout going forward? Let’s answer the latter question by doing a quick comparison of two players in their rookie seasons with the Red Sox:</p>

Most of them are pretty obvious and involve pitching, but let’s get into it. Below are the Red Sox three most glaring needs, in no particular order.</p>
<h2>An Ace</h2>
<p>This one has already been talked about a lot and is pretty obvious, as 2015 proved the harsh reality that a rotation full of mediocre pitchers gets a team nowhere. The Red Sox are in a good position with some of their younger pitchers, including <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=13164&amp;position=P">Eduardo Rodriguez</a>, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=13143&amp;position=P">Henry Owens</a>, and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=14272&amp;position=P">Brian Johnson</a>, but those guys are not yet ready to be legitimate number one starters. Fortunately, the Free Agent and Trade markets are likely to be flush with top-notch starting pitching; it will be up to Dave Dombrowski to decide how to allocate his resources and improve the roster. Aside from the obvious talent improvement that would come with an established Ace, such an acquisition would also create more competition among the rest of the roster’s pitchers, as there would be one less spot in the rotation available. This competition would be great for both veterans, like <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8779&amp;position=P">Wade Miley</a> and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=2717&amp;position=P">Rick Porcello</a>, and younger players like Owens and Johnson. Competition breeds improvement, which is sorely needed throughout the Red Sox pitching staff.</p>

Since there is always a give/take, ying/yang, etc. we will cover both ends of the emotional spectrum, but for now let’s start on a positive note and take a look at three areas of organizational strength that can be built upon going forward.</p>
<h2>The Lineup</h2>
<p>It’s no secret that the Red Sox need a good amount of pitching improvements if they want to contend in 2016 and beyond. The everyday lineup, however, appears to be in very good shape as currently constituted. Five Red Sox posted an OPS right at or near .800: <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=745&amp;position=DH">David Ortiz</a> (.913), <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8370&amp;position=2B">Dustin Pedroia</a> (.797), <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=13611&amp;position=OF">Mookie Betts</a> (.820), <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=12984&amp;position=OF">Jackie Bradley Jr.</a> (.832), and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=11982&amp;position=1B">Travis Shaw</a> (.822). Additionally, the Red Sox as a team <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=bat&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=0&amp;type=8&amp;season=2015&amp;month=0&amp;season1=&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0,ts&amp;players=0">finished among the Major League leaders</a> in several offensive categories including:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6<sup>th</sup> in Batting Average &#8211; .265</p>
<p>5<sup>th</sup> in OBP &#8211; .325</p>
<p>7<sup>th</sup> in Slugging &#8211; .415</p>
<p>4<sup>th</sup> in Runs Scored – 748</p>
<p>4<sup>th</sup> in RBI &#8211; 706</p>
<p>6<sup>th</sup> in wOBA &#8211; .321</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pretty impressive. Keep in mind that all of this was accomplished despite two of the lineup’s alleged staples – <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8001&amp;position=SS">Hanley Ramirez</a> and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=5409&amp;position=3B">Pablo Sandoval</a> – were worse than replacement level and a complete drain on the offense. The Red Sox had a top-6 offense in the baseball in 2015, with potential to be top-3 in 2016.</p>

<p>Going up against Chris Sale and his now MLB-leading 229 strikeouts, Porcello went pitch for pitch with the White Sox ace for seven shutout innings in his return from the 15-day disabled list. When Sale turned it over to the White Sox bullpen in the eighth, Travis Shaw went deep to break a scoreless tie (who said to move Hanley Ramirez to first anyway?) to give Porcello his first win since May 16.</p>
