<p>Wetzel&#8217;s argument has merit, but there are several flaws in it. His  response to the idea that a postseason would devalue the regular season  (like in the MLB, where essentially every game before August 1 doesn&#8217;t  matter) is to ask why Boise State dropped two spots after beating Hawaii  42-7. First off, his argument is incorrect. Boise State has not been  ranked #2 since at least Week 8. They fell one spot between Week 9 and  Week 10, switching places with TCU, and that probably has something to  do with TCU beat #5 Utah by an even more impressive 47-7. Boise State,  meanwhile, hasn&#8217;t played a ranked team since #24 Oregon State on  September 25. Their highest-ranked opponent was #10 Virginia Tech in  their season opener. #1 Oregon, meanwhile, beat a Top-10 team, #9  Stanford, as recently as October 2. And Stanford has gone <em>up</em> in  rank since that loss, now sitting at #6. The last of the undefeated  teams, Auburn, probably has a case that they should be #1, but they  probably don&#8217;t care. Auburn has already beaten <em>three</em> ranked  teams, including #6 LSU on October 23, and still has two to go,  including Alabama. If they win out, they may take over the #1 spot.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/11/20/keep-the-bcs/">Keep the BCS!</a> (1,270 words)</p>
