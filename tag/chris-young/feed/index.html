In the beginning of the season, Blake Swihart was the starting catcher. Not too long after that he started to lose time to Ryan Hanigan and Christian Vazquez. Soon after Vazquez was thrown into the mix, Swihart was not seen again at the catching position and was dropped down to the AAA Pawtucket Red Sox.</p>
<p>For the majority of the season, Vazquez has been the everyday catcher with Hanigan catching a game or two here and there. But on June 5th Hanigan suffered a neck strain and was put on the 15 day DL. So most recently we have seen Vazquez sharing time at catcher with Sandy Leon, who is batting 10 for 16 (.625) on the season. Vazquez has seen significantly more time than any other catcher the Sox have had this year, but I question this. Christian is batting only .221 this year but is a pretty good defensive catcher with a strong arm. I just question why with a guy like Leon who has been hitting very well when he gets in, doesn&#8217;t see a little more playing time. I understand he&#8217;s only had 16 at bats, but when a guy is that hot coming into his first at bats of the season, you usually keep him in and see what he can do.</p>
<p>The biggest question the Sox face is who is going to be their left fielder. I feel like every time I watch them there&#8217;s someone different in left. The Sox started the season with Brock Holt as their starting left fielder. He played pretty much every day in left and performing at an average rate. But when he suffered a concussion on May 20th, he was put on the DL and hasn&#8217;t returned since. Holt is recovering from a concussion slower than normally but concussions are taken much more seriously now a days since we know so much more about the dangers of them. Holt is currently rehabbing with the Paw Sox and he is batting 3 for 6, with two doubles in two games. His return date to the Red Sox is uncertain but I can imagine when he get&#8217;s back he will be thrown right back into the lineup to see how he performs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when Holt was gone, left field saw action from mainly two different players; Chris Young and Blake Swihart. When Swihart was sent down to the minors, he decided that his best chance at playing for the Red Sox would be to switch to outfield and compete for the left field spot. Being the athletic and quick player he is, he transformed himself into a surprisingly well outfielder. Him and Chris Young would split time with each other in left. But Swihart was placed n the 15 day DL when he severely sprained his ankle running into a wall. So this leaves Chris Young alone, who has been playing left almost every day for the Sox and performing fairly well. He is batting .282 on the season and has had some big hits for the Sox this season. He has turned himself into a guy that we could see as an everyday player in the outfield.</p>
<p>But the thing is, when Holt finally comes back the Sox are going to put him back in left to compete with Young. Which is fair because he lost his starting spot due to injury. However it is not a given that Brock will just get his starting spot back because he was only batting .239 at the time of his injury, so it&#8217;s going to be a battle between the two. And when Swihart returns from his injury, who knows what&#8217;s going to happen because he was also hitting and playing fairly well in left.</p>
<p>Now the problem I have with all of this is that many teams don&#8217;t play well when there&#8217;s constant changes to the starting lineup. Most teams have the same guys at the same positions for the majority of the games. The Red Sox seem to have a different lineup every night. Whether its the catcher, the left fielder, the second baseman, or Ortiz has a day off; its always different. Having too many changes to a lineup too often can screw up the flow or momentum of a team. I blame a good amount of losses to this problem. John Farrell has made many Sox fans angry this year with his questionable choices in just about any decision he makes. As the season goes on, Farrell needs to make up his mind of who his every day players are because playing musical chairs with these guys all year just isn&#8217;t going to work.</p>

In a match-up with one of the very best in the game in Madison Bumgarner, Price was as sharp as he&#8217;s been all season long, spotting his fastball and making quick work of an opportunistic Giant&#8217;s lineup. The only problem? The Red Sox offense, who has carried Price through his lackluster start of the season with tremendous run support, forgot to show up.</p>
<p>John Farrel has to take the lion&#8217;s share of the blame, as he made what I believed to be a huge blunder in the final inning. With men on first and second and just one out, the struggling Travis Shaw was due up to bat. Shaw has looked absolutely lost at the plate as of late, and Farrel should have pinch hit Rutledge or Hernandez for Shaw in this spot. Instead, Farrell elected to take the bat out of the hands of the hottest hitter on the team in Chris Young, and Shaw struck out on a breaking ball in the dirt.</p>
<p>Let me be clear- I am not among the contingency who believe that the Sox are winning despite John Farrell. I think he&#8217;s done a fine job this season, and he&#8217;s earned the right to be at the helm through the playoff push. But some of his in-game decisions this year have been baffling to say the least, and it&#8217;s going to catch up with him at some point or another.</p>
<p>While the loss was certainly frustrating, my big takeaway was the performance of the man brought in to be the ace of this staff.  Price looked like the confident, controlled pitcher we all remember from his days of mowing down lineups in Tampa and Detroit, and he outlasted one of the baseball&#8217;s elite in Bumgarner last night. He got stronger as the game went on, with his fastball touching 95 as late as the 7th and 8th ininngs. Once again, Price was once again done-in by the long ball, which has been the crux of his struggles all season long.</p>
<p>So yeah, the Sox split the mini-series with the Giants, but this series may ultimately be remembered as the moment when David Price found &#8220;it&#8221; for the first time in a Red Sox uniform. Despite their potent lineup, the Sox won&#8217;t be a true contender without a dominant Price come October.</p>

Young was only in left field because Blake Swihart &#8220;severely sprained&#8221; his right ankle in a game against the Blue Jays, and Swihart was only in left because Brock Holt is on the disabled list with a concussion.</p>
<p>All three players are more than capable in the outfield. Swihart has exceptional speed for a utility man, Holt was an All-Star last year, and Young was a reliable starter for the Diamondbacks from 2006-2012 (Young enjoyed short stints playing for the A&#8217;s, Mets and Yankees from 2013-2015). With three viable options, who will emerge as the starting left fielder for the Red Sox?</p>
<p>Holt was originally the man during both spring training and the beginning of the season, but was not hitting as well as he was last year. Swihart was recalled from Triple-A Pawtucket when Holt went down with a concussion. Swihart provided added speed, hitting three triples in 19 games, and batting at .258. The Red Sox seemed to show faith in Swihart, and questions arose as to whether the Red Sox would be looking at Swihart for a long term option in left, or a trade chip in a potential deal.</p>

I&#8217;ve emphasized it a lot before, but it&#8217;s worth mentioning again that Chris Young should never be facing a right-handed pitcher, because he will not have success. Yet once again Young found himself in the starting lineup with a right-hander on the mound in 2016. I&#8217;m sure John Farrell will come up with some ridiculous nonsense explaining why Young replaced <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=9345&amp;position=2B/3B/OF">Brock Holt</a> in Thursday&#8217;s lineup, but it will explain nothing and make no logical sense to anyone.</p>

Rather, it really is worth asking when the Red Sox are going to finally part with John Farrell as their manager and allow Torey Lovullo to take over. It is a question of when, not if, because Farrell is clearly on his last legs as manager. In fact, the Red Sox likely would have relieved Farrell of his duties in the offseason were it not for some extenuating circumstances with his health. Lovullo had several chances to interview for managerial roles in the offseason, but he stayed as bench coach because the Red Sox convinced him that he was next in line to take over the dugout. But regardless of who the replacement is, it is time for Farrell to go; he is clearly in over his head and the Red Sox need leadership from a manager who can win.</p>
<p>It really has been stunning how Farrell&#8217;s in-game managing has fallen off of a cliff in 2016. Not that he was a very good in-game manager in the first place, but there have been multiple occasions in 2016 where Farrell has left literally everyone in the ballpark wondering what he is thinking.</p>
