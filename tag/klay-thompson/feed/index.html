<p>After the Cavs were blown off the floor in game four, I along with the rest of the country had pronounced them dead. I had begun to write LeBron&#8217;s eulogy, complete with a bevy of excuses and narcissistic one-liners that he would have loved. I popped &#8220;The Godfather&#8221; in the DVD player and was prepared to watch it six times in succession as a tribute to LBJ&#8217;s willpower and mental fortitude. I even sent flowers to LeBron&#8217;s mom and step-dad, Delonte West.</p>
<p>The series was all but over. You could see it in the body language of every Cavs player. They were ready to throw in the towel and fire up the old LeBron excuse train. But then, the King finally lived up to his name. Kyrie got the party started with a tremendous individual performance in game five, and LeBron finally woke up and remembered that he is the single most unguardable player in the history of basketball.</p>
<p>No one, not even Air Jordan himself, has ever had a performance quite like King James had in these finals. I mean the guy led both teams in points, assists, rebounds, steals, and blocks for the series for christ&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>He carried the Cavs and the city of Cleveland to their first title in 52 years, and he did it against a team that was destined to be one of, if not thee greatest team of all-time. Of course, the epic comeback would not have been possible without one of the biggest collapses in the history of modern athletics. The Warriors were completely out of sync down the stretch last night, hoisting up horrible shots and hoping that Steph or Klay (The Trash Bros) would bail them out with a late prayer. Their third best player in Draymond Green outplayed both Steph and Klay for most of the series, and that can&#8217;t be the case if you want to beat a player of Bron Bron&#8217;s caliber on the big stage.</p>
<p>As much as I hate to say it, if LeBron cracked under pressure like Steph did in this series, the media would be absolutely DESTROYING him right now. That&#8217;s the price you pay when you build yourself up as one of the biggest front runners of all-time. When you lose, the blame falls squarely on your broad, freakishly muscular shoulders. But when you win, and dominate the way that LeBron did in this series, then all of the praise and credit if yours and yours alone.</p>
<p>Whatever narrative you want to write about LeBron and his career is now open for debate. The comparisons between he and Jordan that seemed all but dead just a few short months ago are now back on the table. That&#8217;s how impressive LBJ&#8217;s finals were.</p>
<p>So where does LeBron go from here? He did what he set out to do and won a championship for his city, and he did so as the best player on the floor byÂ  wide, wide margin. Why stay? Cleveland is a dump to begin with and I&#8217;ve got to imagine that it&#8217;s burned to the ground after last night&#8217;s celebrations. Whatever he does, his legacy is now set in stone.</p>
<p>I hate you LeBron James, and I always will. Your pompous, self-absorbed demeanor will never allow me to truly respect your greatness. But finally, I can say without sarcasm, that I truly, truly respect you.</p>
<p>PS- Someone check on J.R. Smith. Like right now.</p>

I don&#8217;t think anyone, including the Warriors, thought that OKC would put up this kind of a fight against the defending world champs. Up three games to one, the Thunder were in the driver&#8217;s seat. Russell Westbrook couldn&#8217;t be stopped and was looking like the best player on the court. Kevin Durant was playing sound, efficient basketball on both ends of the floor, and the supporting cast, particularly Steven Adams, seemed to be making all the little plays that make the difference in a tight series.</p>
<p>But then, Steph Curry happened. Klay Thompson woke up from his coma and dropped 19 in the fourth quarter to force game seven. When you get a great team like the Warriors on their heels, you have to go for the jugular. Can&#8217;t let Steph and Klay hang around long enough to get hot. The role players, including Anderson Varejao, who apparently still plays basketball, and others did their part down the stretch. Oracle was LIT. Steph was crossing anyone who dared to guard him and making it look more effortless than ever. When I think about Steph Curry twenty years from now, this is the game I&#8217;ll remember. The way he, the Thunder, and everyone watching knew the ball was going in the second he came off of the screen.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got to be honest, I was starting to grow tired of all the Golden State love. ESPN constantly shoving them down our throats and social media losing their minds every time Steph hits a three. But the Warriors are just too much fun. One of the all-time great teams in sports and last night showed just what kind of resolve they really have. Can&#8217;t wait to watch them take down King James once again in the finals. I enjoy watching LeBron James lose just as much as I enjoy watching my teams win. If that&#8217;s wrong, then I don&#8217;t want to be right.</p>
<p>PS- Hey KD, you know who doesn&#8217;t play in the Western Conference with the big bad Warriors and Spurs? The Celtics. Just saying&#8230;</p>

The only loss in their last five games was a close one when Boston travelled to San Antonio and fell 108-105 to the Spurs (18-5). Boston has also notched four straight home court wins and is averaging 108.0 points per game in their last five games, this will be important if they want to have a chance against the high octane Golden State Warriors.</p>
<p>The C&#8217;s areÂ coming off an impressive team performance against the Bulls in which eight players scored in double figures without a single one playing over 40 minutes. Isaiah Thomas again led the scoring charge with 20 points, 5 assists and 5 rebounds. Jared Sullinger continued to clean the glass with 16 rebounds to go with his 10 points and Kelly Olynyk once again provided a spark off the bench pouring in 15 points in just 20 minutes of action. Ex-Warriors big man David Lee got back in the flow last night after missing time with a bruised heel to score 12 points and snatch six rebounds. Chicago, who now sit at 11-8, third in the central division behind Cleveland and Indiana put up a fight until the final bell. Jimmy Butler dropped 36 points and nabbed seven boards while Gasol was good for a double-double in points and rebounds with 16 and 15, respectively. A face mask-wearing Derek Rose had 12 points and six assists in the loss.</p>
<p>Boston is coming into this game flying high. Success on the road plus a good win in a tight game at home has the guys in green as ready as ever for the matchup with the champs. However, there is no doubt the undefeated Warriors come into the game, despite key injuries to Harrison Barnes and Klay Thompson, with ultimate confidence.Â Why shouldn&#8217;t they be confident? They have stepped on the court 23 times this season and won all 23 games, it seems like everyday they are breaking or about to break another consecutive win record.</p>
<p>The matchup is interesting for many reasons, statistically the Warriors rank 1st in the NBA in offensive efficiency, 1st in 3-point FG points per game and rarely turn the ball over ranking 24th in the league in that regard. On the flip side the Celtics rank 3rd in the NBA in defensive efficiency, 4th in 3-point FG points per game and are 1st in defensive turnovers. Putting the stats on the back burner for a minute, someone that watches the Celtics can see they pass the eye test as well. This team is deep, they keep fresh legs on the floor, they have young athletes that can get up and down with Golden State to contest and try to keep them from scoring easy transition buckets, and they have the ability to defend the three point shot, at least as good as anyone can against a Warriors team with a plethora of shooters.</p>
<p>As far as offensive and defensive personnel for both teams, Steph Curry may be the best offensive player in basketball right now but the Celtics have one of the better defenders at the guard position in Avery Bradley. An interesting play may also be to try the longer Evan Turner on Curry in efforts to disrupt his hair-trigger release and to mix in different looks defensively.</p>
<p>A major advantage that Golden State has over most teams is their ability to go to the smaller line up and have success. They have so many skill players with Draymond Green perhaps being the best example. Green is someone that can bang down low and guard on the perimeter then turn around and knock down threes or drive to the basket on offense. The Celtics also have a lot of skill players and bigs that can stretch the floor making the Warriors work on defense just as they force opponents to night in and night out. Trying to keep pace in a run and gun style with the Warriors would surely be a mistake however the option to play with a smaller line up may help the Celtics manage the tempo without giving up blow-by layups and penetration on the defensive end.</p>
<p>Offensively the Celtics can help themselves by playing disciplined basketball, getting up good shots, continuing the balanced attack, and making the Warriors play defense for the majority of the shot clock. Another key will be taking care of the basketball. Carelessness will lead to layups and transitions threes and no one puts up points faster than Golden State.</p>
<p>For the Warriors, who will be going for the NBA record for most consecutive road wins, they have a big question mark named Klay Thompson. At this point he is listed as a game-time decision after tweaking his ankle in a 131-123 win over the Pacers Tuesday in which he lit them up for 39 points and went 10-16 from behind the arc. If Thompson doesn&#8217;t play and Barnes continues to sit as planned, the Celtics can focus more efforts on Curry, perhaps trying to trap him, double him, aggressively hedge screens and do anything else in their power to make him give up the basketball. This season the reigning MVP, averaging 32.2 points per game, has shown he is not just a shooter, he&#8217;s a pure scorer, a passer, and a playmaker with other worldly handles. Steph Curry and the team basketball culture this Golden State team brings out each night is truly a spectacle and a treat for all basketball fans. Most of the time Curry has the ball on a string and during this win streak seems to be making all the right decisions with the rock. However with increased pressure from a barrage of Celtics defenders and his one and two wing options in suit coats he will have to be special to create for himself and make plays for teammates. If Thompson does play the task will be a tall one for Boston but with the spirit of this young, hungry Celtics team its unlikely they would want it any other way.</p>
<p>If the Warriors are able to get by the Celtics they play their next four games against teams with records of .500 or worse before the Christmas Day NBA Finals rematch against Lebron James and the Cavaliers at Oracle Arena in Oakland. The Warriors have remained humble and hungry on this record setting season which will serve them well as Brad Stevens will have the Celtics geared up and locked in for what is sure to be a raucous TD Garden on Friday night in Boston. Tip-off is set for 7:30 as the C&#8217;s try to dethrone the undefeated and undisputed heavyweight champs of the NBA.</p>
