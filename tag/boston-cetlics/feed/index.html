<p>Then the first 2 picks went off the board and the moment was finally here.  Celtics fans everywhere were expecting Adam Silver to go to the podium and announce a trade.  Then as he stepped up to the podium he said &#8220;And with the number 3 pick The Boston Celtics select Jaylen Brown From The University Of California&#8221;.  Just like that Celtic fans everywhere were deflated (sorry I know that&#8217;s a touchy word around New England).  All this hope has been shot down, and from the reaction of Celtic fans they were not happy.  It was good to see Boston fans boo, Celtic fans don&#8217;t do that often and it really seemed like Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck looked uncomfortable when he was booed off the stage.  Which by the way I don&#8217;t think has ever happened before.</p>
<p>Personally, I like Jaylen Brown as a player.  He&#8217;s versatile, athletic, and can defend other team&#8217;s best player.  The problem is The Celtics have multiple guys on the roster with these same skills.  Brown has to improve his shooting, last season he only shot .294% from the three point line.  Jaylen Brown could be an impact player for The Celtics, and it could be this season.  We won&#8217;t know if this was the right pick until two to three years from now.  After the Celtics didn&#8217;t make a splash with pick number 3, I felt they were going to draft and stash.  The Celtic&#8217;s didn&#8217;t want to be tied up with guaranteed contracts and not be able to do something in free agency, and the only way to draft guys and not have to pay them was to stash them overseas.</p>
<p>The Celtics and more importantly Wyc Grousbeck have really created this monster.  This monster being us Celtics fans that want to win now and are tired of always waiting for next year&#8217;s draft.  We all know Danny is really trying to bring a superstar into Boston, but until that happens don&#8217;t promise us fireworks and then leave us with an unlit firecracker.</p>
