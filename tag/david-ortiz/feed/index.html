Tonight, Rick Porcello and his 22 wins will take on Trevor Bauer and the Indians at Progressive field in Cleveland. The Indians, led by former Red Sox manager and fan-favorite Terry Francona, will look to capture their first playoff victory since 2007. Francona, who led the Red Sox to two World Series titles (including the team&#8217;s first in 86 years) was &#8220;let go&#8221; after the Red Sox epic collapse down the stretch of the 2011 season. While the bad blood between Francona and the Red Sox organization seems to have dissipated tremendously since the breakup, I think it&#8217;s safe to say that Francona would love nothing more than to stick it to Red Sox brass, particularly John Henry.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where David Ortiz comes in. The man who has carried this team and this city on his back since that magical run back in 2004 will look to fire up the magic one last time in his final postseason appearance. A World Series title would strengthen David&#8217;s case as one of, if not the greatest playoff performer of all-time. Additionally, it would cement his legacy as one of the three greatest Red Sox players to ever live.</p>
<p>David Ortiz IS October. October rolls around and David Ortiz&#8217;s eye lasers zero in on baseballs and send them to the moon. No pitcher is too clutch. No moment is too big. It&#8217;s time to ride Big Papi to the promise land one final time. God, am I going to miss this guy.</p>
<p>No beisbol is safe, no beisbol is safe.</p>

<p>The Red Sox chose the losing route. Needing just three outs to kick off the celebration with a win, Craig Kimbrel threw 28 more pitches than I did in recording the same number of outs (that would be zero). He gave up a single, walked three, and threw a wild pitch.</p>

Coming into Thursday only one game ahead of Baltimore, the Red Sox had some pressure on them. What started off as a slow night turned into one to remember. Heading into the bottom of the ninth at Fenway, the Sox were trailing the Yankees five to one.</p>
<p>Note to self: <strong>NEVER LEAVE A SPORTING EVENT EARLY.</strong></p>
<p>The Sox rallied in the ninth as David Ortiz drove a line drive up the middle to put run number two on the board. Next  up, Mookie Betts drives another run in to make it a two run deficit. Then Hanley Ramirez steps to the plate. Dellin Betances throws a handful of breaking balls to Hanley. When the count showed 3-1, Betances reared back and threw a fastball right down the middle. Ramirez connected with the pitch and hit an absolute moonshot three run home run over the center field wall. Hanley knew it was gone right off the bat, as some may say he &#8220;pimped it&#8221; as he walked down the line and held his bat high in the air.</p>
<p>Hanley gracefully trotted around the bases and then was mauled by his teammates at home plate. The home run was Hanley&#8217;s 25th of the year and it also jumped his rbi count to 100. This win was so important with the AL East standings being so close between the Sox, Orioles, and Blue Jays. Boston now sits in first place and two games ahead of Baltimore. Every game in September is an important win as the Sox are nearing the end of the regular season. Boston has three games remaining in their series with the Yankees.</p>
<p>Not only was tonight a night to remember for Hanley, but also for David Ortiz. In the bottom of the eighth inning, Ortiz hit a line drive home run to center field. It was his 34st homer of the season and also the 537th of his career, passing Mickey Mantle on the all time home run list. David now sits at 17th all time. It&#8217;s really going to be something when he leaves the game.</p>

The powerhouse hitting Red Sox are now in a position where the postseason is not a guarantee. They have been bouncing in and out of first, second, and third place for a majority of the season. The Red Sox, Blue Jays and Orioles have been the most dominant teams in the Al East all season.</p>
<p>Going into Monday Aug. 29th, the Red Sox sit in second place with a 72-58 record, two games behind the Blue Jays. Baltimore sits right behind the Sox, only one game back. So the question we are all wondering is who is going to win the division?</p>
<p>I believe at this point it&#8217;s a complete toss up. We can pull out as many statistics as we want to predict the end of the season results but we have to remember that this is baseball. This game is so unpredictable, especially when there are only 30 games left to be played. Any team could take the division with being just a half game up, it could be that close.</p>
<p>The good news is that the next month of baseball is going to be tough for all teams in the AL East. Starting tonight until the end of the season the Sox have two remaining series against the Rays, Yankees, Orioles, and the Blue Jays. So the standings in the AL East are going to be jumping all around for the next month. If the Sox want a legitimate chance at taking the division, they need to be the best team in the month of September, period.</p>
<p>If the Sox do not win the division, they always have the Wild Card. But with the Wild Card , the top two teams have to play in a one game playoff match up to decide who moves onto the ALDS. Boston needs to avoid this at all costs because a one game deciding match up is a tough game to win. If this were to happen I&#8217;d be scared to see who Farrell decides to start on the bump.</p>
<p>However I am very confident the Sox will finish the season strong. Their hitting is still very dominant. Ortiz is still showing he&#8217;s one of the best with 30 plus homers and 100 plus RBIs. Mookie is still one of the best hitters in the entire MLB right now with 29 homers, 94 RBIs, and a .321 AVG (Did I mention he was a lead off hitter for the majority of the season?). And Pedey quietly is hitting .320 going into Monday. So the bats are there. Again as we&#8217;ve discussed a million times, it all comes down to the Sox pitching. Starting pitching for Boston has looked better lately, the bullpen is still an issue. All we can do at this point is pray that the pitching comes around going into September.</p>
<p>The toughest series the Sox are going to have this next month are the ones against the Blue Jays. Toronto plays as the biggest threat towards Boston. They are a very well rounded team that can hit and have some pitching. The two series the Sox have against them in the next month are definitely the most imports series they will have all year.</p>
<p>This all being said, I&#8217;m super excited for the next month of baseball because its going to be a a fun one to watch.</p>

<p>Over this road trip, The Sox starters have a combined ERA of 1.51.  It doesn&#8217;t matter who&#8217;s on the mound right now, from Price, Porcello, Pomeranz, and even Clay Buchholz, they are all producing.  Most impressive all the starters are able lately to go deeper in the game, which really helps with a bullpen as putrid as The Sox pen.  With these being the dog days of summer and another long road trip on the horizon, The starters have to continue to dominate the way they have been.</p>
<p>The offense hasn&#8217;t been too shabby over this stretch.  Betts and Ortiz have been hot of late, and with constant contributing from Sandy Leon, Dustin Pedroia, and Hanley Ramirez this offense isn&#8217;t showing any signs of slowing up.  It would be nice to see Xander get going, his last two games he has had two hit in each game, which is a good sign.  As well as the starters have been pitching they could go south very fast, and if or when that happens it will be up to the offense to carry the load.</p>

<p>The Red Sox should have won this series pretty easily, but now?  The Yankees are only 3 games back of The Sox in the standings.  The Yankees are not a good team.  They unloaded at the trade deadline by trading, Andrew Miller, Aroldis Chapman, and Carlos Beltran.  New York pretty much waved the white flag at the deadline, and now they have hope.  I&#8217;m not saying The Yankees are a threat in the division or the wild card.  The point is these are the games you have to win when you&#8217;re fighting for a playoff spot.</p>
<p>The Red Sox had a lead going into the 7th inning in all 3 games of the series.  They lost two of those games.  The one game they did win, they walked the bases loaded in the ninth.  This Red Sox bullpen is putrid.  It seems like they can&#8217;t get anyone out, especially when there are guys on base.  It seems like this pitching staff has no guts.  They can&#8217;t get the big strikeout when the pressures on, it seems like they get tight and timid.</p>
<p>This series wasn&#8217;t all the pitching staffs fault.  What happen to the offense?  Just about a month ago they were crushing the baseball.  Now?  They have 2 hits in their last 29 attempts with the bases loaded.  This offense is much to talented to go into slumps like this.  Speaking of slumps, why does it seem the whole team goes in one giant slump at the same time?  It seems like this team is lacking confidence right now.  They could really use a benches clearing brawl to wake them up, or you know they could fire the manager.</p>
<p>They start a 3 game series with Arizona tonight, it&#8217;s safe to say sweeping The Diamondbacks is a must.  Especially with the tough road games on the horizon.</p>

Two Red Sox players are considered to be serious contenders in this year&#8217;s insanely competitive AL MVP race. Those two players are Xander Bogaerts and David Ortiz. However there are many other great players to consider when talking about the MVP race.</p>
<h2>Potential AL MVP Candidates</h2>
<ul>
<li>Josh Donaldson</li>
<li>Jose Altuve</li>
<li>Robinson Cano</li>
<li>Mike Trout</li>
<li>Manny Machado</li>
</ul>
<p>Many people put Josh Donaldson at the top of the list right now. Donaldson was the AL MVP last season and is once again having himself a fantastic season. But I personally wouldn&#8217;t put him at the top of the list right now. If I had to choose a player right now to be at the top of the AL MVP race I would choose Astros 2B Jose Altuve. Altuve currently leads to MLB with 135 hits and a .358 AVG. Right behind Altuve I would put Ortiz. Ortiz leads the MLB with 34 doubles, a SLG of .665, and an OPS of 1.083.</p>
<p>The only problem with Ortiz is that he&#8217;s a DH. Many people use that against him because there are no defensive stats to credit him with. But with the performance David is having at the plate this year makes him a serious contender for the MVP award in his final season.</p>
<p>Do not forget about Xander Bogaerts. He is being viewed as a genuine player to win the award. He is arguably one of the best hitting shortstops in the entire MLB. As of Saturday Xander has 125 hits (3rd in the MLB behind Jose Altuve and Mookie Betts), 23 doubles, 11 home runs, 61 RBIs, .324 AVG, .381 OBP, .469 SLG, and a .850 OPS. Xander is also a very good defensive player with a .973 fielding percentage and only 9 errors in 813 innings.</p>
<p>The AL MVP race is going to be a very competitive one this year because there are so may players that could take the crown. But it is only half way through the season so nobody knows who&#8217;s going to stay on track or drop off the candidate list. All I&#8217;m saying is to not count the Sox sluggers out of the race, especially Ortiz. Even though he&#8217;s a DH, he&#8217;s putting up one of the best seasons of his career and has some of the best numbers in the game right now.</p>
<p>Can you imagine a 40 year old in his last season winning an MVP award? We can only hope&#8230;</p>

<p>June is firmly in the rearview mirror for the suddenly wicked hot Boston Red Sox, and for at least 24 hours, doubts and criticisms have been silenced.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, the Red Sox needed only a one-run home run from Brock Holt to take the victory, but they graciously accepted a three run shot from Big Papi to provide all the run support that Rick Porcello would need. Porcello looked strong, earned his tenth straight win at home, and the Sox shut out the team with the best record in the majors. It was a feel good win, reminiscent of Octobers past, and indicative of Octobers future.</p>

<p>The blast was number 526 for David, who was recently placed at number 78 on ESPN&#8217;s list of greatest baseball players of all time.</p>
<p>Consider last night just another day in the office in this man&#8217;s fabled baseball career. He owns this city, just as Tom Brady owns the NFL. So, does Dave Dombrowski have a case to bring back Big Papi for 2017? A few months ago, the answer would undoubtedly have been no, but with the second half of the season well underway, there has been some indecisiveness. Nothing definitive has been said regarding one more year for the 40 year old, but there is an air of hope for the Fenway faithful.</p>

<p>This game held special meaning for David Ortiz, the AL DH. In his final season, and final all star game, Ortiz was the starter for the AL at DH. While Ortiz was certainly the man of the hour, it was his Red Sox counterparts that actually outperformed Papi in San Diego.</p>
<p>Ortiz went 0 for 1, with a walk, and was pulled shortly thereafter. Xander Bogaerts, Mookie Betts, and JBJ all had at least one hit, contributing to the 4-2 victory over the NL.</p>
<p>Xander smacked a double down the left field line, Betts singled and scored, and Jackie Bradley sent two singles through the infield.</p>
<p>Eric Hosmer was the game&#8217;s MVP, who homered and drove in two runs.</p>
<p>The Red Sox are back in action tonight, taking on the Yankees in the Bronx. Eduardo Rodriguez is starting for the Red Sox.</p>
<p>The Red Sox are doing well so far in July. It has been no secret that pitching has been holding this team back. As previously spoken about on SOB, Dave Dombrowski traded Anderson Espinoza, the number one pitching prospect for the Red Sox to San Diego for Drew Pomeranz, who is likely to be the number two or three starter for Boston moving forward.</p>
<p>The Red Sox also managed to sign their first round draft pick, Jason Groome, to a $3.65 million contract, pending a physical.</p>
