				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="justify">After a punishing skating session, Bruins fans were enthusiastic about the matchup between their team and the long hated Habs. Despite their best efforts, the Bruins fell short; thanks to a brutal performance of Tim Thomas between the pipes.</p>
<p align="justify">I must say that I was very frustrated by the result since the team worked very hard to get back in that game being down 2-0 (the second goal was a gift by Thomas) after one period. We can&#8217;t stress this issue enough: it starts with goaltending. The Bruins were good in the first half of the season because of Thomas&#8217;s performance. Now, the team has a tough time building a long winning streak because of Thomas&#8217;s inconsistency. Peter Chiarelli acquired Manny Fernandez because Tim Thomas was not good enough and because their were questions about his consistency. In his last 10 games, Thomas had, at least, 4 bad games where he was a factor in the team losses. Of course, it&#8217;s not his fault entirely. One player can&#8217;t make a team win, but in hockey, you need strong goaltending to achieve a high level of performance. With Fernandez on the self, the Bruins are in the same situation as last year.</p>
