The B&#8217;s must bring in another blue-liner if they want any shot at a playoff spot this upcoming season so with that said, here are a few available defensemen that could fill the void on the backend and be relatively cheap options at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>James Wisniewski</strong>: The 31 year old had a rough season last year after he blew out his knee just minutes into the first game, causing him to miss the remainder of the year with the Hurricanes.  Wisniewski has been injury-prone during his career but he might be the best all-around defenseman still on the open market. He&#8217;s a bit of a journeyman in his 10 year NHL career suiting up for eight different teams, yet he&#8217;s still put up decent numbers in that time. His best year came with the Blue Jackets in &#8217;13-&#8217;14 when he recorded 51 points for Columbus. Wisniewski&#8217;s injury problems and lack of production might keep him off other teams radars for now, however look for him to be a prime candidate for a professional try-out (PTO) this fall. Given what the Bruins currently have and the likelihood that they can get him for cheap, the B&#8217;s should absolutely bring Wisniewski in just to see what he can still do.</p>
<p><strong>Kris Russell</strong>: Russell has gotten a lot of flack around these parts as being the one guy the B&#8217;s should avoid, and I&#8217;m not exactly sure why. From what I can tell, his game hinges around shot-blocking and a strong first pass out of the zone, similar to newly-signed Bruin John-Michael Liles. That doesn&#8217;t sound so bad to me as I liked what JML brought to the Bruins last year after the trade deadline. However, he is criticized for his unreliable defensive play and that&#8217;s one thing that would worry me if they did bring him in. The 28 year old might not be the most polished option, but he can&#8217;t be as bad as some of the players the B&#8217;s tried last year, <em>cough</em> Matt Irwin <em>cough</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Luke Schenn</strong>: The former fifth overall selection in 2008 probably won&#8217;t be looking at Boston as a future destination after spending most of his career in hockey crazed cities such as Toronto and Philadelphia, but if it turns out Schenn does enjoy the high-pressure markets, Boston might be the right place for him. He isn&#8217;t a player that&#8217;s going to wow anybody with his stats but his physical, in-your-face style of play will surely have Sweeney and Neely eyeing his services. With Kevan Miller and Adam McQuaid already locked up for a few years, it would only make sense to sign Schenn if Sweeney plans on trading one of the two.  This wouldn&#8217;t be the most ideal situation for the B&#8217;s as they really don&#8217;t need another hulking defenseman, however if he is signed, I&#8217;d trust him more with the puck on his stick than I would Miller or McQuaid.</p>
<p><strong>Marek Zidlicky</strong>: Zidlicky was linked to Boston a few years back as another blue-line addition, but he was ultimately traded to the Red Wings that season. The 38 year old right shot defenseman would make a lot of sense on a one year deal with the B&#8217;s since his skill-set along with his age would create a low-cost, high-reward scenario. Zidlicky isn&#8217;t the same player he once was but his game also isn&#8217;t as diminished as it could be at this point in his career. His skating ability and offensive presence would certainly help a defensive squad often seen out of position, and off the score sheet, and his overall experience could replace that of Dennis Seidenberg, who was bought out last week. Zidlicky&#8217;s veteran presence, reliable game, and low cost seems like a great fit for a Bruins team that desperately needs fresh faces on defense.</p>

Zdeno Chara, the team&#8217;s captain and anchor on the blue line,  suffered a knee injury and did not return to the game. He is expected to miss 4-6 weeks, maybe more.</p>
<p>This is a huge blow to the team because in Chara they have their leader as well as the most important part of their defense.</p>
<p>“You see your captain go down, and probably your most important player go down. It’s definitely not a great sight to see,” B’s winger <b>Milan Lucic</b> said after the game. “He’s irreplaceable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The situation goes from bad to worse when it seems as though Chara may need surgery on top of that. For someone his size, at his age, this is not a good thing to hear. Chara has been a rock for the Bruins in his 9 seasons here, missing only 20 games during that span. Needless to say, his loss will be a very difficult one to replace.</p>
<h2>Injury Fallout</h2>
<p>So what options to the Bruins have in the wake of his injury? For starters, each of the members of the defense has to step up. This is especially true for Dougie Hamilton and Dennis Seidenberg, who will be called on to log the most minutes on the team&#8217;s top pairing. Adam McQuaid will have to up his physical presence, and Torey Krug will have to be the B&#8217;s top weapon on the blue line.</p>
