The NCAA basketball tournament kicked into full gear.  Texts from the world’s most famous golfer were made public, which revealed his propensity for going ATM and choking out porn stars. There was a week long hype over the Bruins grudge match with Matt Cooke and the Penguins (and the subsequent and expected half ass effort by the B&#8217;s Thursday night). Throw in an apocalyptic rainstorm early in the week, St. Paddy’s Day in the middle and the arrival of spring weather right after the aforementioned apocalyptic rainstorm, and we had ourselves quite a hectic few days.</p>
<p>So it’s understandable that news from Patriots camp would go slightly under noticed. Besides, it was just off-season workouts, and the story from those is always “who’s there” and “who’s not there.” Nothing too riveting when compared to March Madness, a monsoon, mid-week debauchery and a golfing sodomite.</p>
<p>And while normally I could give a rat’s ass whether some grown man shows up in Foxboro to run some sprints and hit the tackling sled when football season is still a good 5-6 months away, this year there was an absence that did catch my (and a few others) attention.</p>
<p>(And if you’re thinking Adalius Thomas’ absence is what caught my eye, you’re wrong. I let him slide this go around because apparently he &#8220;didn’t know” that there were even workouts, which makes sense because I’m sure he doesn’t own a cell phone, have an Internet connection or make contact with the outside world in any way whatsoever.)<br />
