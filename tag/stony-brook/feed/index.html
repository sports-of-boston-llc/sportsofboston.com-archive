Coach Pat Chambers and his squad have fallen to fifth overall in the America East conference and have dropped two straight games against the upper echelon teams of the league. BU has suffered recent losses to conference foes Stony Brook, Maine, and Vermont, currently ranked first through third in the conference.</p>
<p>Four of the six Terrier wins have come against the bottom feeders of the conference UMBC, UNH, and Albany, who have only combined for five conference victories. BU has struggled against the better teams in the conference, getting blown out by 20 at Vermont last Sunday, January 17th, and recently getting defeated by 16 against Stony Brook. For the third consecutive year, BU has been picked as the preseason conference favorite to win the America East, but this statement is looking bleaker by the day. Coach Chambers has some serious work to do before their next game at Agganis Arena, this Thursday vs. New Hampshire.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/02/03/terriers-in-a-funk-losers-of-two-straight-games/">Terriers in a Funk, Losers of Two Straight Games</a> (336 words)</p>
