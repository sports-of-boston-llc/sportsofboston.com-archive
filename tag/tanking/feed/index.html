				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Boston Celtics started a deep rebuilding process this past summer. They traded away Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce and they even <a href="http://www.fantasybasketballmoneyleagues.com/los-angeles-clippers-doc-rivers/" target="_blank">sent Doc Rivers to the LA Clippers</a>. In exchange, they received a bunch of draft picks for the next few seasons. So normally, they were expected to be tanking by now, a month and a half into the 2013-2014 season. But they aren’t.</p>
<p>So what are the C’s actually doing right now? Are they contending for a playoff spot?</p>
<p>The truth is that not even the team’s general manager, Danny Ainge, knows how to describe the Celtics this season. Certainly, a below 0.500 record is not impressive. The Celtics currently have a 12-14 record, but they also hold the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference. With the picture the East currently has, it will be no surprise if several teams below 0.500 entered the playoffs. Boston stands many chances to be among them.</p>
<p>However, Ainge stated one more thing when he was recently interviewed. He said that the playoffs is not a goal for the Celtics this season. So what’s really the goal for the team? Certainly, The C’s didn’t trade away their best assets to simply decompose the team right? They should have a goal. And although MarShon Brooks, Keith Bogans, Kris Humphries and Gerald Wallace can’t really put the team into a championship route, they surely have a role on the team.</p>
<p>The truth is that the Boston Celtics were expected to be sinking by now.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2013/12/17/should-the-celtics-be-tanking/">Should the Celtics be Tanking?</a> (266 words)</p>
