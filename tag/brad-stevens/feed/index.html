It&#8217;s all happening! Everything is awesome! It&#8217;s not a stretch to say that yesterday was the biggest day in the Groesbeck/Ainge/Stevens era in Boston. Danny was finally able to close that elusive big-name free agent, and Wyc was able to make good on his promise of &#8220;fireworks&#8221; that the fan base has been waiting on for what feels like centuries. Sure, $113 million over four years seems like a pretty penny, but with the money being thrown around this offseason and the huge cap increase on the horizon next season, Horford&#8217;s deal is actually somewhat of a bargain.</p>
<p>Horford&#8217;s game will fit seamlessly within the Brad Stevens system. He provides a much needed presence at the rim, and gives the C&#8217;s the go-to fourth quarter scoring option that they were sorely missing in last year&#8217;s playoffs. I cannot WAIT to see Isaiah and Horford running the pick and pop down the throats of the entire Eastern Conference come October.</p>
<p>By no means is Al Horford a perfect player, as evidence by his lackluster performance in the playoffs last season against these Celtics. He struggles defensively at times, particularly on the perimeter defending the pick and roll. The C&#8217;s team approach to defense should help to conceal some of Horford&#8217;s defensive deficiencies over the course of the season.</p>
<p>Hot damn, the Celtics are officially back. They finally landed a big name free-agent for the first time in the history of the franchise, (Go ahead look it up, I&#8217;ll wait) and they got a guy who WANTS to play in Boston. KD or not, this signing was a huge step in the right direction for this franchise. If TB12, Big Papi, and Julian Edleman have anything to do with it, Kevin Durant will be donning Celtic green next season in the city of champions. What a time to be a Celtics fan. What a time to be alive.</p>

Tom Brady, the GOAT, was in attendance at the meeting to help Danny Ainge in the recruitment of Durant. Also David Ortiz would have been there to help but he was busy nuking baseballs into the stands at Fenway.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Kevin Durant needs to come to Boston. The Celts just signed All-Star Al Horford to a four year 113 million dollar deal, Isaiah Thomas is our point guard, Brad Stevens is the head coach, and the team is only improving. If Durant signs with Boston, they immediately become a contender for the NBA Finals. This new big three of Thomas, Horford, and Durant would be absurd. Three legitimate elite players on the same team would do some damage next season so it only makes sense for Kevin to play for the Celtics and he has to know that.</p>
<p>One thing I hope Kevin understands is just how praised he will be in Boston. Players in the NBA know that Boston fans are different. We&#8217;re the most passionate fans out there and we are always there supporting our team through the good and the ugly. Al Horford told his Dad that part of the reason he signed with the Celtics is because of the fans. He knows that when he steps foot on the hardwood in the Garden wearing that green jersey, everyone is going to go nuts for him. If Kevin Durant does the same, he will become loved beyond belief in Boston and I know that for a fact. And hey it&#8217;s Boston&#8230;who doesn&#8217;t love it here?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what was said in Durant&#8217;s meeting with the Celtics but I do know one thing. Ainge most definitely told Durant that if he comes to Boston, he will become a Celtic legend, just like he told Isaiah. So please Kevin, make the right and best decision of your life and play for the best basketball franchise ever.</p>

<p>Al Horford has been recruited by Durant to come to OKC for some time now.  So The Celtics acquiring Horford makes the Celtics pitch that much more intriguing.  Horford is a top 20 player in the NBA, and with Isaiah already in green, The Celtics could put serious pressure on The Cavs if Durant is to choose Boston.  The fact that just hours after The meeting with The Celtics, Durant informed The Clippers he would not be signing with them is very interesting.</p>
<p>I am really starting to think that this could actually happen, and if it does, perhaps Brady&#8217;s number 12 should be retired in the rafters at the TD Garden.</p>

<p>Then the first 2 picks went off the board and the moment was finally here.  Celtics fans everywhere were expecting Adam Silver to go to the podium and announce a trade.  Then as he stepped up to the podium he said &#8220;And with the number 3 pick The Boston Celtics select Jaylen Brown From The University Of California&#8221;.  Just like that Celtic fans everywhere were deflated (sorry I know that&#8217;s a touchy word around New England).  All this hope has been shot down, and from the reaction of Celtic fans they were not happy.  It was good to see Boston fans boo, Celtic fans don&#8217;t do that often and it really seemed like Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck looked uncomfortable when he was booed off the stage.  Which by the way I don&#8217;t think has ever happened before.</p>
<p>Personally, I like Jaylen Brown as a player.  He&#8217;s versatile, athletic, and can defend other team&#8217;s best player.  The problem is The Celtics have multiple guys on the roster with these same skills.  Brown has to improve his shooting, last season he only shot .294% from the three point line.  Jaylen Brown could be an impact player for The Celtics, and it could be this season.  We won&#8217;t know if this was the right pick until two to three years from now.  After the Celtics didn&#8217;t make a splash with pick number 3, I felt they were going to draft and stash.  The Celtic&#8217;s didn&#8217;t want to be tied up with guaranteed contracts and not be able to do something in free agency, and the only way to draft guys and not have to pay them was to stash them overseas.</p>
<p>The Celtics and more importantly Wyc Grousbeck have really created this monster.  This monster being us Celtics fans that want to win now and are tired of always waiting for next year&#8217;s draft.  We all know Danny is really trying to bring a superstar into Boston, but until that happens don&#8217;t promise us fireworks and then leave us with an unlit firecracker.</p>

<p>You see, the Celtics played so poorly that I couldn&#8217;t just settle for saying they &#8220;laid an egg,&#8221; but needed scientific confirmation of the largest egg in existence in order to aptly describe just how bad a loss the Celtics suffered.</p>
<p>And that was before I saw Celtics coach Brad Stevens&#8217;s quote saying his team &#8220;laid an eight-minute egg.&#8221;</p>
<p>Isaiah Thomas and Jae Crowder played just 21 minutes and didn&#8217;t see the court in the fourth quarter. RJ Hunter got extended minutes, and the Hornets were so far ahead after a 31-3 run to close out the second quarter that they felt comfortable playing Tyler Hansbrough. Tyler Hansbrough!</p>
<p>In other words, I don&#8217;t think even an ostrich egg suffices. The Celtics laid an elephant bird egg, 120 times the size of a chicken egg and larger than a dinosaur egg.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2016/04/12/celtics-hornets-playoffs-eight-minute-egg/">With Playoffs in Sight, Celtics Lay &#8220;Eight-Minute Egg&#8221; in Blowout Loss to Hornets</a> (452 words)</p>

<p>In his absence, the Celtics lost four in a row to the Rockets, Indiana Pacers, Oklahoma City Thunder, and Toronto Raptors before rebounding with wins over the lowly Philadelphia 76ers and the struggling Orlando Magic. Those two wins propelled the Celtics back into the conversation for the third seed, but they are now mired in a playoff seeding slugfest with 11 games left in the regular season, including a season long five game road trip with stops against the Portland Trail Blazers, LA Clippers, and (gulp) Golden State Warriors. That doesn&#8217;t sound like much of a silver lining (even if Crowder will travel with the team).</p>

The win in Cleveland was likely the Celtics biggest win of the season, especially being on the road and playing the Cavaliers after they had come off a loss. It looked ugly early for the Celts Friday in Cleveland but they were able to hang in and keep it close in the first two quarters before gaining the lead in the second half. A balanced attack with Isaiah Thomas, Avery Bradley, Evan Turner, Tyler Zeller and Jared Sullinger all scoring in double figures helped to hold off the Cavaliers late game push. The grittiest play of the game came with the Celtics down two points with seconds left. A missed free throw from Evan Turner allowed for Marcus Smart, 6&#8217;4&#8243;, boxing out Timofey Mozgov, 7&#8217;1&#8243; to cause a scramble for the rebound that ultimately went out off the Cavaliers. This afforded the Celtics just the chance they needed and, on a broken play, Bradley gathered himself to knock down the game winning triple from the corner.</p>
<p>Rolling into Sunday winners of three straight and coming off dethroning the mighty King the C&#8217;s hung 46 points on Sacramento in the first quarter en route to the win. They were in control wire to wire despite a pesky performance from the Kings who made runs but were never able to recover from the 76 point first half performance of the Celtics.</p>
<p>Boston is now in sole possession of third place in the Eastern Conference behind Cleveland and Toronto, they are winners of four in a row and nine of their last ten. Celtics&#8217;s fans have reason to be excited with the wins and the way the team has continued to get better and play together. However, four and half games is all that separates the now third place Celtics and the ninth place Hornets. The C&#8217;s will need to continue to win with a tough schedule ahead. Boston not only has a slew of balanced Eastern Conference teams to play that will all be jockeying for position but still has a variety of tough Western Conference opponents to face after the All-Star break including Golden State, Oklahoma City, Los Angeles Clippers (and Lakers), and Memphis to name a few, those wins will not come easy.</p>
<p>For now Boston will head to Milwaukee to go for five straight wins against the Bucks who are losers of five straight, before coming home to face Doc Rivers and his 34-17 Clippers that have won seven of their last ten, doing so without Blake Griffin.</p>
<p>The Celtics should feel confident heading to the Midwest behind their Eastern Conference player of the week Isaiah Thomas who continues to put up numbers and help the C&#8217;s win games. His most recent weekly stat line to earn said honors goes like this: 20.3 points, 7 assists, 4.5 rebounds, and 1.3 steals over 33.6 minutes per game. With the C&#8217;s seeming to play their best basketball of the season coach Brad Stevens will continue to keep their feet on the ground and their eyes on the clipboard to hopefully finish the next two games strong before heading into All-Star weekend.</p>

The Cavs stand alone atop the Eastern Conference at 35-13 while Boston has mustered a 29-22 record, good for a third place tie with Atlanta. The Celtics have been winning games by putting up points, scoring over 100 points in 13 of their last 14 games, that ties them for fifth best in the NBA with San Antonio. Defensive intensity has also been a mainstay with the C&#8217;s giving up 100.3 points per game, not too shabby, and good for ninth best in the NBA, just behind Indiana and ahead of the Clippers.</p>
<p>Led by All-Star point guard Isaiah Thomas there is no doubt that the Celtics are on the rise and coming down the stretch run will hope to continue this push for home court advantage in the first round of the playoffs. It should be noted however that the competition that Boston has recently played is not near what they will face Friday night. The Celtics have essentially taken care of business and won games they are supposed to win to be considered a contender in Eastern Conference. The most notable recent victories have come over the Pistons, Pacers and Bulls who, if the regular season ended today, would be in the playoffs.</p>
<p>Cleveland on the other hand is in a different class than recent Celtics competitors. They are 7-3 in their last 10 games and have had marquee wins over San Antonio and the Clippers. Changes for Cleveland since they beat the Celtics 89-77 in December include the presence of Kyrie Irving who did not play as he was still rehabilitating a fractured knee cap and Cavs new head coach, ex-Celtics assistant coach Tyronn Lue, after the surprise firing of David Blatt.</p>
<p>Its likely going to be a difficult environment for the Celtics playing in Cleveland in front of a Friday night packed house. Not to mention LeBron James and the Cavs will be looking to rebound from a loss to the Hornets in a game where they did not face their opponents leading scorer Kemba Walker. Instead they were torched by Jeremy Lin, that&#8217;s right Jeremy Lin who hung 24 points and eight dimes on Cleveland, sending them too defeat. Expect a fired up crowd and a Cavaliers team trying to fend off a second straight loss as the Celtics try to keep their string of winning ways alive at Quicken Loans Arena.</p>
<p>Key match ups to watch will be Isaiah Thomas, who is coming into the game scoring 21.4 points per game to go with 6.6 assists, and Kyrie Irving who is averaging 17.2 points per contest. However it is somewhat unlikely they will actually defend one another all the time as Brad Stevens will rotate Marcus Smart and Avery Bradley onto Irving to stifle his attack with their tenacious on ball defense. Another match up to watch will be Jae Crowder doing his best to slow down the LeBron James freight train and the carousel of Celtics bigs trying to rebound with Kevin Love, Timofey Mozgov and Tristan Thompson.</p>
<p>If the Celtics are able to score over 100 points, as they have been consistently doing, and are able to keep the Cavs off the offensive glass for easy put backs, they will have a shot of dethroning the King and his Cavs in their own castle. On the other hand, if the Celtics are forced to grind out a poor shooting performance like the game back in December they will surely struggle against the defending Eastern Conference Champs.</p>
<p>Its a potential playoff preview of two teams heading in the right direction, the Cavs under the new direction of Tyronn Lue, and the red hot C&#8217;s playing their best basketball under Brad Stevens. The Q Arena should be rocking on Friday night and Celtics fans will be able to see how this improved Boston team measures up against the likely number one seed in the east!</p>
