With the offense devastated by injuries, the defense played some of its best football of the season. The offense is clearly dealing with communication and trust issues with all the new pieces being plugged in along the way. For the first time in weeks the offensive line was healthy but ironically it was the worst they&#8217;ve looked all year. Tom Brady&#8217;s most reliable receiver with zero dropped passes, Danny Amendola, left with an apparent knee injury. After his exit they had three healthy receivers. One was Matthew Slater and another was Chris Harper who has never caught an NFL pass. With all that they still made the plays to win a divisional game in prime time.</p>
<p>&#8211; Aside from a few big plays the defense showed again how good they can be. The front seven was holding contain on Tyrod Taylor for the majority of the game. Pressure caused by the pass rush directly led to multiple poorly thrown passes. LeSean McCoy did break the 27-yard touchdown run but was held to just 55 rushing yards other than that. By his standards that&#8217;s a relatively calm day. Rob Ninkovich continued his solid campaign by adding another 1.5 sacks and pressuring Taylor throughout. Rotating defensive linemen throughout the game has paid off for the Patriots as each group knows exactly what their job is, and they&#8217;re doing it well.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/11/25/notes-and-observations-week-11-defense-leads-battered-patriots-to-victory-over-bills-20-13/">Notes and Observations Week 11: Defense Leads Battered Patriots to Victory Over Bills 20-13</a> (978 words)</p>

With Rex Ryan taking over as head coach of the Buffalo Bills the &#8220;experts&#8221; laid on the hype thick and often. Rex did what he always does and stuck his foot in his mouth all week (of course it&#8217;s a Rex foot joke). Bill did what he always does and took the time to prepare an outstanding game plan that featured the very guy Ryan claimed he didn&#8217;t know, Dion Lewis. If you don&#8217;t know by now that Belichick will use every single thing he can to his advantage then you haven&#8217;t been paying attention for the past 15 years. Yesterday&#8217;s game can be summed up simply with Belichick took one series on offense and defense to figure out exactly what Rex&#8217;s game plan was.</p>
<p>&#8211; What Tom Brady is doing at 38 years old is nothing short of remarkable. Of course, to everyone in New England who has been watching all this time this is just business as usual. Remember how great he was in 2007 when it wasn&#8217;t him who was personally targeted all offseason for an absolutely ridiculous investigation? If you don&#8217;t here&#8217;s a quick reminder. In his first two games in 2007 we threw for 576 yards, six touchdowns and one interception. Through two games in 2015 he has 754 yards, seven touchdowns, no interceptions and a completion percentage of %69.2. Brady has played with a chip on his shoulder his whole career and thanks to Roger Goodell and no one in the league understanding how air pressure works, he&#8217;s on pace for the best season of his incredible career.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/09/21/notes-and-observations-week-2-patriots-remind-everyone-who-runs-the-afc-east-defeat-bills-40-32q/">Notes and Observations Week 2: Patriots Remind Everyone Who Runs the AFC East; Defeat Bills 40-32</a> (1,944 words)</p>

The Patriots were rolling in with two rookies starting in the interior of the offensive line. It had the potential to be a tough day for the Patriots up front.</p>
<p>It ended up being just the opposite, however. Despite attempting a whopping 59 pass attempts, Tom Brady was only sacked twice. This was due in part to Brady and the Patriots making a point to get rid of the ball quickly, not allowing the Bills enough time for their rush to win. The other major reason was the play of the offensive lineman. Rookie David Andrews played every snap at center while rookies Tre Jackson and Shaq Mason rotated at guard along with Josh Kline. Nate Solder and Sebastian Vollmer consistently won against talented Bills&#8217; edge rushers.</p>
<p>Not only did the line pass block well, their run blocking was impressive. Because the game plan was to throw and throw quickly, the Patriots only ran the ball 15 times and gained 56 yards. The only goal of the run game on Sunday was a change of pace option, and it worked well when used, including a touchdown run by Dion Lewis.</p>
<p>The Patriots should be very pleased with the effort of their offensive line. This was likely the biggest challenge they will face until the end of October when New England takes on the Jets. With this test passed, the offensive line is looking like it could be a strength of the team instead of a question mark.</p>

The Patriots, who could likely start two rookies along the offensive line again, will face a massive challenge protecting Tom Brady and opening up holes in the running game.</p>
<p>Marcell Dareus, the biggest star defensive lineman the Bills have, will be playing his first game of the season on Sunday after serving a one game suspension. He is dominant interior presence and was rewarded as such by the Bills with a massive contract extension last week. He can disrupt an entire offensive line on his own with his ability to stuff the run and push the pocket in the passing game.</p>
<p>The Bills spent big money on free age Mario Williams in 2012 and that investment has paid off handsomely. In three full seasons with the Bills, Williams has 38 sacks and five forced fumbles. He is a dominant outside player who needs to be accounted for on every snap and throughout his career has proved himself worthy of being selected number one overall in the 2006 draft.</p>
<p>Although Kyle Williams has no relation to Mario, his excellent inside play make them kin of offense wreckers. Coincidentally selected in the 2006 draft as well, Williams has been a very good defensive tackle his entire career. His best season was 2013 when he recorded 10.5 sacks and a forced fumble, which he followed up with 5.5 sacks and an interception in 2014. Although he has not always piled up high stat numbers, he is an invaluable space eating piece on the Bills defensive line.</p>
<p>Last but not least for the Bills on their defensive line is end Jerry Hughes. Entering his sixth season, Hughes has established himself as a premiere edge rusher in the NFL. His breakout year was 2013 in which he took the opposing quarterback down 10 times and followed that up with 9.5 sacks last season. His three forced fumbles in 2014 were huge for Buffalo and cemented Hughes as perhaps the most dangerous player in an already dangerous Bills’ front.</p>
<p>Given that the Bills have all four of these players in their primes, their defensive line has a legitimate chance to be the best in the NFL. The Patriots will have their hands full preventing the Bills defensive line from dictating the play of the game.</p>
<p>For the Patriots, they will be likely starting two rookies once again. Rookie center David Andrews played well in week one against Pittsburgh, but has never seen the quality of talent that will be across from him on Sunday. Tre Jackson was up and down in his debut last Thursday and will need to have a strong and complete outing in order to slow down the Bills. Nate Solder and Sebastian Vollmer will have their hands full on the outside and they both won’t be getting help on every play. The Patriots will likely employ a quick passing game and try to catch the Bills moving too far upfield with draws and screens.</p>
<p>The Bills are going to have success up front. The Patriots job is to limit how much success the Bills have. If New England can get ahead early and limit the effectiveness of the Bills front four, they will have a good chance of ending the day with a win. However, if the Patriots are sluggish and the Bills defensive line gets off to a dominating start, it could be a long afternoon in Orchard Park.</p>

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola)" ></a><p><span style="color: #222222;">It is certainly refreshing to have a team so successful that the last game of the season is completely meaningless. Yes, it wasn&#8217;t the best 60-minutes of Patriots football, but it didn&#8217;t have to be. All that mattered was getting out of that game without any injuries and giving some players who normally don&#8217;t see actual game action the chance to see the field. Another bonus was the defense went yet another game without letting up a second half touchdown, which is impressive considering the Patriots&#8217; B squad was going up against the Bills&#8217; A squad.</span></p>
<div style="color: #222222;">&#8211; There is a little bit of worry with the back-ups along the offensive line. I am very confident in the usual starting five of Nate Solder, Dan Connolly, Bryan Stork, Ryan Wendell, and Sebastian Vollmer. Yesterday both Connolly and Vollmer were out, and Solder didn&#8217;t play the entire time. We all saw a lot of Josh Kline, Marcus Cannon, and Cameron Flemming. Kline continues to look lost out there and we all should cross our fingers that Connolly doesn&#8217;t get hurt. I have little to no confidence with Kline protecting the blind side of Brady. Cannon has looked good when he&#8217;s subbing in and playing along side most of the starters. However yesterday he didn&#8217;t fair too much better than Kline. Again this is a small concern because it&#8217;s unlikely we&#8217;re going to see inexperienced lineman playing as long as the veterans are healthy.</div>

<p>&#8211; I have a feeling there won&#8217;t be many people calling for a trade of Tom Brady this week. Two consecutive weeks, Brady has looked like himself and strong offensive line play is the reason. Last week more so than this week, but due to injuries to Bryan Stork and Dan Connolly they had to make some moves on the line. It was not a bad showing at all as Brady was sacked only twice. He&#8217;s had more time to  stay in the pocket and it has led to his two best games of the season, Sunday being his best. He finished going 27-37 for 361 yards and four touchdowns. The most impressive stat of the game was that he completed a pass to 10 different receivers. (...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2014/10/14/notes-and-observations-week-6-patriots-claim-first-place-beat-bills-37-22/">Notes and Observations Week 6: Patriots Claim First Place, Beat Bills 37-22</a> (1,799 words)</p>

The second half was one of the strongest halves the team has played this season on both offense and defense. Tom Brady was dominant and so was Darrelle Revis, although his performance was overshadowed by Brady and injuries to Jerod Mayo, Dan Connolly, and Stevan Ridley.</p>
<p>Revis covered Sammy Watkins for the entirety on the game and held Watkins to just two catches for 27 yards. He has played man on man for three full games this season, against the Vikings, Bengals, and now Bills. Against the Vikings, Revis held Greg Jennings to one catch of four yards and also had an interception. While matched up against Bengals star A.J. Green, Revis allowed only 64 yards on three catches to go along with his strong performance against Watkins today.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2014/10/13/revis-island-overshadowed-by-injuries-to-mayo-connolly-ridley/">Revis Island Overshadowed by Injuries to Mayo, Connolly, Ridley</a> (213 words)</p>

Photo Courtesy of buffalonews.com" ></a><p>When the Bills moved up to fourth overall in May’s draft to select Clemson receiver Sammy Watkins, they got a physical specimen who was polished enough to be an instant play maker. Bills General Manager Doug Whaley said, &#8220;We thought it was a calculated risk and a risk we were willing to take.&#8221; The Bills are hoping that risk turns into an elite playmaker for a franchise that has been at the bottom of the AFC East for a decade.</p>
<p>A rib injury cut in to Watkins’ training camp, forcing him to miss significant time and preventing him from ever getting in a rhythm with Manuel. Through four games, Watkins has shown flashes of that ability but has also lacked some effort on plays across the middle and did not click with E.J. Manuel. He seemed to be on the same page with new starter Kyle Orton, registering seven catches for 87 yards in a 17-14 win in Detroit. He also made a key 20-yard grab to set up the Bills winning field goal.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2014/10/08/containing-sammy-watkins-will-be-a-priority-for-the-patriots/">Containing Sammy Watkins Will be a Priority for the Patriots</a> (431 words)</p>

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola)" ></a><p>After everything that has happened to the Patriots this season, it is absolutely incredible they are the number two seed in the AFC. The offseason was highlighted by Tom Brady&#8217;s favorite receivers from the year before, but in the worst possible scenarios. Wes Welker went to Denver to catch pass from Brady&#8217;s rival Peyton Manning. Rob Gronkowski had an endless string of surgeries that put him on the shelf for the first half of the season. Aaron Hernandez was arrested and is awaiting trial for a murder charge. The season has been plagued with injuries to most of their key players. Jerod Mayo, Vince Wilfork, Tommy Kelley, Sebastian Vollmer, and Rob Gronkowski are all on injured reserve. Shane Vereen, Danny Amendola, and Aqib Talib have all missed reasonable amounts of time dealing with injuries of their own. Not to mention the revolving door of an offensive line that has been called upon to protect Brady and produce in the run game. Add all of that up and you can see just how impressive this season has been for the Patriots.</p>
<p>&#8211; The obvious mention from Sunday&#8217;s game is the amazing performance by LeGarrette Blount. To think they traded Jeff Demps, who is currently not playing due to track and field, is an absolute steal. Over the past weeks we have seen the running game emerge into what looks very much like a rushing attack made for January football. Yesterday was the culmination of everything that has been building up, and it was highlighted by Blounts showing. He finished the game with 189 yards on 24 carries and two touchdowns. Then add on that he had 145 yards on kick returns and it is obvious Blount put this game directly on his shoulders. He continued to push the pile forward on runs as he&#8217;s been doing all year, but he also showed incredible vision. Blount is the type of bruising runner who every team would want come January.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2013/12/31/notes-and-observations-week-17-patriots-beat-bills-clinch-2-seed-in-the-afc/">Notes and Observations Week 17: Patriots Beat Bills; Clinch #2 Seed in the AFC</a> (1,020 words)</p>
