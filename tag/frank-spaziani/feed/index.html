(boston.com)" ></a><p>Sophomore RB Josh Haden and Redshirt Freshman QB Justin Tuggle have both decided to transfer from Boston College today. Both have seen less and less playing time as the year has gone on.</p>
<h3>Justin Tuggle lost the starting QB job and apparently fell to at least third on the depth chart</h3>
<p>Although never said it out loud, the Tuggle transfer seemed imminent with him sitting third on the depth chart recently after starting the first three games. Tuggle’s athleticism was his greatest asset at QB, but he was never accurate and had a tendency to heave down field jump balls even when no one was open. In his first two games against Kent State and Northeastern, he threw for 206 yards and three touchdowns, but against Clemson he fell apart on a dismal 4-20 outing with three interceptions. When true Freshman Mike Marscovetra came in to replace a struggling Dave Shinskie against Virginia Tech instead of Tuggle, it looked like Tuggle’s window of opportunity at BC shut. Even after a rough performance by Shinskie against a weak Notre Dame defense, Tuggle was no longer confident in his chances to succeed at Boston College. Highly touted incoming QB Chase Rettig would have put Tuggle in an even further hole next year if he stayed.</p>
<h3>Montel Harris&#8217; stellar play earning him most of the touches</h3>
<p>What caused more of a stir was the move of Haden from Chestnut Hill. After coming in as the key recruit of the Jeff Jagodzinski era (spurning offers from Florida, Michigan, and Ohio State), Jagodzinski handed Haden the starting spot as a true freshman. Jags believed Haden fit the mold of a fast pass catching tailback perfectly, which fit into then offensive coordinator Steve Logan’s spread offense. Lightly recruited and ex-Duke commit Montel Harris quickly earned a spot in the rotation and ended up gaining 421 more yards on 59 more carries. He had more receiving yards. The duo ended up second in the nation for freshman running back tandem and carried that chemistry into this year with Montel Harris changing his number from 42 to 2 to literally become a 1-2 tandem with Haden.</p>
<p>Harris ran wild this season (with the exception of the Wake Forest game) and, after dominating the Florida State game, never looked back. Haden is currently averaging 1.4 yards less per carry than Haden and 1.1 yards less than promising true freshman Rolandan Finch. His tendency to dance in the backfield and inability to break tackles has greatly hampered his play. Josh Haden’s brother Joe currently plays on the Florida Gators and is one of the top corners in the nation.</p>
<p>Head Coach Frank Spaziani wished both players well.</p>

(AP Photo/Winslow Townson)" ></a><p>After watching this week&#8217;s Wake Forest game, here are some observations on the football team&#8217;s progress.</p>
<h3>QB Dave Shinskie seems to have control of the offense.</h3>
<p>While Justin Tuggle relied on the deep ball, Shinskie relied on the short and medium range passing game. Always more suitable for conservative Offensive Coordinator Gary Tranquill, Shinskie played to his abilities, even showing a little movement in the pocket, and the offense looked back on track after a miserable Clemson outing. Yet, Shinskie still cannot throw the long ball and looked tight for the fourth quarter and overtime. Overall though, Shinskie looks like the solid starter going into the Florida State game, but I feel Tuggle could get a look if Shinskie struggles mightily against a stout Seminole defense.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/09/29/five-eagle-eyed-thoughts-from-week-four/">Five Eagle Eyed Thoughts from Week Four</a> (403 words)</p>

(AP Photo/Mary Ann Chastain)" ></a><p>Here are five reactions to this week&#8217;s BC game against Clemson.</p>
<h2>The quarterback position now belongs to Justin Tuggle</h2>
<p>Despite throwing for a magnificent two yards in the first half on 2-7 passing, Tuggle remained in the game for ninety percent of the snaps with Dave Shinskie getting very limited snaps. On Shinskie’s first snap in the second quarter he fumbled and things did not get much better afterwards. Hopefully, Shinskie can either fight the good fight pushing Tuggle to improve or he could pull a Codi Boek and become a fullback. Either way, Frank Spaziani looks like he has chosen his guy: a guy who threw 20 passes with four completions, totaling 23 yards and an interception.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/09/24/five-eagle-eyed-thoughts/">Five Eagle Eyed Thoughts</a> (340 words)</p>
