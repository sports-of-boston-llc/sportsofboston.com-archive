<p>In no particular order…</p>
<h2>Celtics Sign Rasheed Wallace</h2>
<p><a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/07/05/rasheed-wallace-signs-with-celtics/">Surprise</a>! Well, maybe not, but the Celtics have assured the rest of the NBA that they are able and willing to compete with the best-of-the-best to try and secure their 18<sup>th</sup> championship.  With the Cavaliers signing Shaquille O’Neal and the Lakers getting Ron Artest, the Celtics are right where they need to be to make a big statement. Although a big statement is almost guaranteed, the way Wallace racks up those technical fouls…</p>
<h2>Big Papi is Actually Hitting Home Runs</h2>
<p>In seasons past, this would seem ridiculous on a “did that just happen” list. But times have changed, and so has David Ortiz’s swing. Although at this point in the season, I think it’s finally safe to say that he’s really back – Ortiz’s <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/07/09/papi-power-pushes-sox-to-victory/">three-run homer</a> in Wednesday’s game against Oakland and <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/07/10/a-royal-disappointment-red-sox-lose-again-at-fenway/">now Thursday</a>, proves it.</p>
<h2>Steve “Air” McNair is Shot and Killed</h2>
<p>And if that wasn’t enough <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/07/04/steve-mcnair-killed/">to shock us all</a>, the latest <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/football/articles/2009/07/09/police_say_mcnair_was_sleeping_when_shot/">reports</a> are saying that it was a murder-suicide.</p>
<h2>Red Sox lose to Oakland A’s on Nomar’s return to Fenway…</h2>
<p>Did anyone see this coming for Monday night baseball? A <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/07/06/as-win-in-nomars-return/">6-0 shutout loss</a> in the opening game of the series against the A’s? At Fenway Park? It certainly took me by surprise. The icing on the cake was <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/07/06/nomar-garciaparra-as-visit-fenway/">Nomar Garciaparra’s first visit</a> back to Fenway since 2004. He even earned a standing ovation. The Red Sox went on to win their next <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/07/08/sox-win-slightly-more-interesting-than-house-rerun/">two</a> <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/07/09/papi-power-pushes-sox-to-victory/">games</a> against the A’s, so maybe we can just chalk that one game up to bad luck.</p>
<h2>…but Tim Wakefield becomes an All-Star rookie at 42.</h2>
<p>This makes <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/07/08/tim-wakefield-an-all-star-for-the-rest-of-us/">Wakefield the oldest player selected to play in the All-Star game since 1952</a>. Well done for Wakefield, who has been dominant this season with <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/07/09/papi-power-pushes-sox-to-victory/">Wednesday night’s win making it his 11</a><sup><a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/07/09/papi-power-pushes-sox-to-victory/">th</a></sup><a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/07/09/papi-power-pushes-sox-to-victory/"> of the season</a>, the best record in MLB.</p>
<p><strong>Side note:</strong> As a team, the Red Sox will be sending <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/07/05/wakefield-named-to-all-star-team/">six players to the All-Star game</a>. Talk about representation.</p>
<p>What about the rest of you? What would you add to the “did that just happen” list for this week?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is my belief that everyone has at least one good memory of Steve McNair.</p>
<p>I remember when I first heard about him.  I spent a summer in Nashville in 1999 while my Dad was working with a company trying to prevent Y2K (yeah that computer bug that &#8220;changed&#8221; the world).</p>
<p>While walking around the city, everything was abuzz about the new franchise coming to town.  Since leaving Houston, the Oilers were slowly making their way to Nashville and in 1999, the city happily welcomed the Tennessee Titans.  Merchandise was everywhere, as well as images of their star quarterback, Steve “Air” McNair.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/07/06/remembering-steve-mcnair/">Remembering Steve McNair</a> (584 words)</p>

<p>McNair reportedly was shot in the head in downtown Nashville and did not survive. Details are sketchy at this hour but it looks as though it was a double homicide as a female was also found dead at the scene.</p>
<p>McNair, 36, played 13 years in the NFL, mostly with the Tennessee Titans. He retired in 2007.</p>
<p><strong>My Take:</strong> Obviously some shocking news. McNair will always be known for his days in Tennessee and the fateful final play against the Rams in the Super Bowl where the Titans came up one yard short of tying the game.</p>
