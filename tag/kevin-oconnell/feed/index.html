<h2>Kevin O&#8217;Connell | QB | San Diego State University</h2>
<p>After multiple pre-draft trips to San Diego by former offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, the Patriots felt they got a steal with San Diego State University quarterback Kevin O&#8217;Connell. The Patriots drafted O&#8217;Connell in the third round of the 2008 NFL Draft and quickly O&#8217;Connell received praise in the media.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Obviously the big news of the day involved Richard Seymour, but the Patriots have also made some other transactions to cut the roster down to 53 before the season begins. The Patriots made 10 cuts to the roster to get down to 53 and the notable players sent packing are OL Ryan O&#8217;Callaghan, OL Wesley Britt and TE Alex Smith. WR Terrence Nunn was also released but has been signed to the practice squad. </p>
<p>Tight end David Thomas, who came into New England with high hopes as a slot guy, was traded to the Saints for a 2011 seventh round pick. LB Shawn Crable &#8211; for the second consecutive year &#8211; will spend the season on injured reserve.</p>
<p>In other Patriots news, former QB Kevin O&#8217;Connell has been trade from Detroit to the NY Jets. O&#8217;Connell was cut last week and was claimed by four teams on waivers, including the mean green, but Detroit was awarded his rights because of their 0-16 record. No word on compensation for the second year man out of San Diego State.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Patriots have released potential backup QB Andrew Walter. Walter played for the Raiders last season, but obviously didn&#8217;t have what it took to stay with the Patriots this year. Walter was just recently <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/08/03/report-patriots-to-sign-andrew-walter/">signed by the Patriots a one month and a day ago</a>. The decision leaves Brian Hoyer holding the reigns as the sole back up for Tom Brady. In case you missed it, <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/08/30/kevin-oconnell-waived-by-patriots/">Kevin O&#8217;Connell was waived by the Patriots earlier this week</a>. <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/09/04/patriots-38-giants-27-3-things-we-learned/">Hoyer was impressive</a> in the Patriots&#8217; final preseason game so clearly the Patriots have confidence in the undrafted QB.</p>
<p>Coach Belichick had this to say about Walter&#8217;s release:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think Andrew had a lot of positives, and we talked about those when we signed him, and I think they still exist. In the end we still made decisions that are in the best interest of the football team.</p></blockquote>
<p>When asked about whether or not the team would be seeking at least one more backup in addition to Hoyer, Belichick answered (...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/09/04/andrew-walter-released-by-patriots-aj-feeley-a-target/">Andrew Walter Released by Patriots &#8211; A.J.

<h2>1. BenJarvis Green-Ellis Should Be on the Team</h2>
<p>Spare me the addage that his performance (29 carries, 125 yards, 3 TDs) was against third and fourth stringers. Late in the fourth quarter BJGE (my name for him) burst through the line and scored a 32 yard touchdown &#8211; his third of the game. He runs hard, hits the hole and isn&#8217;t afraid to make contact, much unlike a certain former first round pick, who didn&#8217;t play Thursday. There is no doubt BJGE has a spot on an NFL roster and here&#8217;s to hoping it&#8217;s on the Patriots roster.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve become pretty accustomed to the way things work around Foxboro after nearly a decade of the Bill Belichick era yet once in a while we see a roster move that still leaves us shaking our head. That seems to be the case today as the Patriots have waived second year quarterback Kevin O&#8217;Connell.</p>
<p>Having arrived at camp as the presumptive backup to Tom Brady, O&#8217;Connell has struggled in the pre-season and now finds himself without a team. The move is surprising simply because there is no clear backup in the system and O&#8217;Connell seemingly had the job locked up coming into 2009, if not only because he&#8217;s been in the system longer. The second year man from San Diego State was a also a third round pick in the 2008 NFL draft so this again leaves the average fan wondering. </p>
<p>With O&#8217;Connell gone it leaves Andrew Walter and Brian Hoyer on the roster. In other words, look for the Patriots to go after another veteran before the season begins.</p>

The 27-year-old out of Arizona State University has certainly had a very poor professional career. At 6-6, 230 pounds, Walter sure looks the part, but sometimes size doesn&#8217;t matter. In 2006, Walter started eight games for the Raiders where he threw for 1,677 yards while only completing 53.3% of his passes. He also passed for only three touchdowns while being intercepted 13 times.</p>
<p>Now, to Walter&#8217;s defense, he was playing behind one of the worst offensive lines this league has ever seen and because of that he was sacked 46 times during his playing time. Not to mention that his No.1 receiver was out there jogging routes and refusing to go over the middle. Who was that? Oh yeah, Randy Moss.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/08/03/report-patriots-to-sign-andrew-walter/">Patriots sign Andrew Walter</a> (170 words)</p>

We&#8217;ll start off with the position which most fans feel is the easiest to diagnose yet deep down inside in places you don&#8217;t talk about at parties makes you worry the most: quarterback. By the way, happy birthday to our first player previewed this year:</p>
<h2>Tom Brady</h2>
<p><strong>2008 statistics:</strong> 7/11, 76 yards, 0 TD, 0 INT<br />
<em>2009 Forecast:</em> A surgically repaired knee, a new wife and another child on the way combine to create quite a buzz around the already normally hyped Tom Brady. Will his knee hold up? How much will he play in the preseason? Will Giselle make an appearance at Gillette with a pink No. 12 jersey? All questions we will learn about in due time. However if this crafty blogger&#8217;s job is to make predictions so here we go.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As training camp kicks off at Gillette Stadium in roughly two weeks, we&#8217;ll take a look at five questions that will be on the minds of many.</p>
<p><strong>Part I: Tom Brady</strong> | <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/07/27/five-burning-questions-part-ii/">Part II: The Secondary</a> | Part III | Part IV | Part V</p>
<h2>1. The health of Tom Brady</h2>
<p>Early indications make it seem evident that Patriots quarterback, Tom Brady, will be healthy come training camp. However, coming off an ACL injury is no easy task. Carson Palmer of the Cincinnati Bengals had a similar injury happen to him against the Pittsburgh Steelers a few years ago, however Palmer’s healing process expanded over a year and half. And even when Palmer was fully healed and saw game action he was suspect that season for the Bengals. So, how will Brady fair this season? That’s the big question. The Patriots go as far as the right arm of Brady will lead them, so it’s imperative for the star quarterback to be healthy for the Patriots from this point out.</p>
<p>Although he may look strong right now and through training camp, there is still a sense of uncertainty on how he will respond to contact in live game action, especially when the pocket collapses and he is forced to use his mobility.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/07/20/five-burning-questions-part-i/">Five Burning Questions: Part I</a> (169 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know what you are thinking. A starting quarterback and our defensive leader for a measly second round pick? Isn&#8217;t Matt Cassel less of a risk to a bad team than taking an unproven starter in the first round? What is Bill Belichick thinking turning down a top 15 pick from Denver and instead making a deal with an old pal?</p>
<p>Fair questions sure enough. Instead of taking a Madden &#8217;09 GM approach to the Patriots-Chiefs trade earlier this week and looking at what could have been in hindsight, it&#8217;s important to look broadly at the move. The Patriots made the best deal that made the most financial sense at the time it was offered.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is the first installment of my end of the year grades for the 2008 New England Patriots. We&#8217;ll start with the most talked about position on the team for many reasons, the quarterback.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Cassel: A</strong><br />
<em>Thoughts:</em> We all thought the worst when Tom Brady suffered his career ending injury in Week 1 against the Chiefs. I was at Gillette for the game and even though Cassel did a great job pulling out the win, I remembered how horrid he looked in the preseason and figured the Patriots were screwed. Though I still thought they could win nine or 10 games with their schedule I had no idea Matt Cassel would turn into the player he did. His stats were impressive (3,693 yards, 21 TDs, 11 INTs, 89.4 passer rating), his pocket presence drastically improved and his ability to take over and win a game understated. For a guy who sat on the bench since high school, Cassel improved leaps and bounds in every aspect of his game and now the Patriots have quite a chip to either trade or keep in case Brady isn&#8217;t ready for 2009. What he brings to the table that Brady doesn&#8217;t is the ability to run with the football when needed. There were innumerable plays this year when Cassel scrambled out of the pocket to pick up big first downs. Whatever team he ends up playing for in 2009 will have a competent, hard working and skillful quarterback.<br />
