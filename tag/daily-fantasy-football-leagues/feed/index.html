<p><strong>Top Picks</strong></p>
<p>WR- Marvin Jones.</p>
<p>I love Marvin Jones this week.  He didn&#8217;t have a very good 2015 season, however he&#8217;s in a new offense with Detroit.  Calvin Johnson is retired, and I expect The Colts to focus on stopping Golden Tate.  With cornerback Vontae Davis out for Indianapolis look for Stafford to look for Jones a lot in week 1.  This game also has the highest over/under of the week at 51.  Priced at 4,600 on draftkings Jones is a great play in week 1.</p>
<p>WR- Amari Cooper.</p>
<p>Amari Cooper is going to have a big week 1.  There are 15 wide receivers who are priced higher than him on draftkings this week, which makes him a great play.  His ownership will be high but he will reach value.  With Drew Brees playing at home expect this game to be high scoring, and for Derek Carr to look for his top target a lot on sunday.  The saints were also the worst ranked defense last season.</p>
<p>RB- Lamar Miller.</p>
<p>Lamar Miller has a very good matchup this weekend against the Chicago Bears.  Miller is a very talented running back who didn&#8217;t get enough touches in Miami.  With Deandre Hopkins putting all the pressure on the Bears defense expect Miller to have a big day catching passes and running the ball.  Miller is my top running back play this week.</p>
<p>RB- LeSean McCoy.</p>
<p>McCoy should be the focal point of the Bills offense this season.  With Karlos Williams not with The Bills anymore expect McCoy to get a lot of touches for the Bills.  His price tag on draftkings is a little high this week, however the potential is there for McCoy.</p>
<p>QB- Brock Osweiler.</p>
<p>Osweiler should get off to a good start in his Texan career with a good matchup against the Chicago Bears.  Expect a lot of passes to newest addition Lamar Miller, and a couple of jump balls to Pro Bowl wide receiver Deandre Hopkins.  Osweiler has 20 quarterbacks higher priced than him on draftkings this week.  His ownership won&#8217;t be what it should making him a great tournament play this week.</p>
<p>TE- Jason Witten.</p>
<p>Jason Witten is not the player he used to be, however with Dak Prescott starting for The Cowboys expect him to look for Witten a lot as a security blanket in week 1.  Jason Witten is only priced at 4,100 on draftkings and at that price tag, and with Witten&#8217;s upside he should be a lock in your lineup.</p>
<p><strong>Sleepers</strong></p>
<p>RB- James White.</p>
<p>With Dion Lewis out, James White assumes the role as the third down running back for New England.  With Jimmy Garoppolo starting against a great Cardinals defense look for Josh Mcdaniels to get the ball out of Garoppolo&#8217;s hands quick, and look for James White to be the beneficiary to the quick passes.</p>
<p>TE- Austin Seferian-Jenkins.</p>
<p>Jameis Winston loves his tight end.  With Tampa Bay playing at Atlanta it should be a high scoring game.  Look for Winston to utilize his big tight end in the red zone which should result in a touchdown reception.</p>
<p>WR- Tyler Boyd.</p>
<p>Boyd should be the number 2 receiver in Cincinnati.  With AJ Green getting all The Jets attention, Boyd could be a good play this week, especially being priced at just 3,600.</p>
<p><strong>Top 2 Stacks.</strong></p>
<p>Matthew Stafford/ Marvin Jones.</p>
<p>As Marvin Jones is one of my top plays of the week, he is also part of my top stack of the week.  The game against The Colts should be a shootout which will pay benefits for both Stafford and Jones this week.</p>
<p>Eli Manning/Odell Beckham JR.</p>
<p>On the road in Dallas, it&#8217;s a division game.  Look for there to be a lot of points in this game and look for Manning and Odell to provide most of them.</p>
<p><strong>Risky pick of the week</strong></p>
<p>Ryan Fitzpatrick/Brandon Marshall.</p>
<p>A lot of people will stay away from these 2 given their bad matchup on paper against The Bengals.  However, if you want to win a tournament this weekend this should be a stack you really look at.  In the redzone Fitzpatrick loves throwing to Marshall.  Marshall lobbying with the Jets to get Fitzpatrick signed this offseason is a good sign for your fantasy team.  Marshall likes playing with Fitzpatrick because he gets opportunities in the red zone.  I expect Fitzpatrick to look for Marshall more than his other targets this week.</p>

The nation will set aside any and all disputes (well, maybe not) and we will collectively plunge into a turkey/gravy/stuffing/potato induced coma. Unhealthy mountains of turkey will sustain some through the rigors of Black Friday, and for others Thursday will just end in a good night&#8217;s sleep with dreams of gravy waterfalls. On a related, but far more important note, due to three Thursday NFL games, and the fact that daily fantasy sites are offering &#8220;Thursday Only&#8221; contests, this will be part I of a two-part Redraft King Turkey Day Extravaganza!</p>
<p>Okay. Calm down. We still need to review week 12 before jumping into Thursday&#8217;s advice.</p>
<p><strong>Week 12 Recap:</strong></p>
<p><i>Tony Romo</i> tossed four touchdowns in a come-from-behind win against the Giants, and had his best fantasy performance so far this year. <i>Josh McCown</i> passed for over three hundred yards and 18.8 fantasy points. <i>Brian Hoyer</i> also threw more than three hundred yards, but three interceptions lowered his point total to 14 for the day.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2014/11/25/redraft-king-week-13-fantasy-football-advice/">Redraft King: Week 13 Fantasy Football Advice</a> (775 words)</p>
