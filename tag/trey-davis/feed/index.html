After victories over Boston College and Northeastern, UMass looked to finish off the Crimson on its first true road trip (even though Lavietes Pavilion was probably packed with 70 percent Minutemen fans) and add another win against an NCAA Tournament team to its resume.</p>
<p>The Northeastern Huskies were supposed to come into Amherst on Wednesday night, but with snow coming in, the game was moved forward into the afternoon to make sure everyone could get home safely and enjoy the Thanksgiving eve celebrations. Apparently, these Huskies aren&#8217;t the kind that love the snow. There was not much to celebrate for Northeastern fans as the Minutemen put together their first wire-to-wire blowout of the season in a 79-54 win highlighted by yet another impressive Maxie Esho <a title="Esho Top 10" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvU5USEi9eA" target="_blank">dunk</a>. Donte Clark also continued to be the most impressive freshman for the Minuteman scoring 10 points and reaching double figures for the third straight game.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2014/11/30/harvard-claims-bay-state-title-over-umass/">Harvard Claims Bay State &#8216;Title&#8217; Over UMass</a> (493 words)</p>

Being able to rebound after a loss is a big factor in having a successful season and UMass has shown that ability both during and in between games. Here&#8217;s a look at how the Minutemen have been able to jump right back into the thick of things without missing a beat.</p>
<p>Last Tuesday, UMass participated in ESPN&#8217;s 24 hour tip off marathon for the third season in a row. The previous two years saw some late game heroics against Harvard and LSU and this year against the Manhattan Jaspers was no different.
