(AP Photo/Jessica Hill)" ></a><p>Peabody Western, the Massachusetts representative in the New England Regional of the Little League World Series, finished a dominating tournament with a come from behind win over Lincoln, Rhode Island 11-7. Peabody trailed 6-2 and staged a comeback to tie the game only to give up the go ahead run in the top of the sixth (the final inning in Little League). In the bottom of the sixth, Rhode Island got into trouble and walked in a run to tie it.Â The next batter hit a walk off grand slam to propel Peabody Western to Williamsport, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Peabody had been dominating in pool play, as the only team in the field to go 4-0 in the round robin format, but had to come from behind in each of the elimination games. They will advance into Pool B of the Series, grouped with Southwest representative San Antonio, TX as well as the West and Great Lakes teams, which have yet to play their finals.</p>

He <a href="http://www.wten.com/Global/story.asp?S=10474813">threw a perfect game</a> and retired every batter he faced by strikeout.

<p>Since there are 1000s of little league teams in the country, it&#8217;s hard to know if it&#8217;s some kind of record. Experts estimate that three perfect perfect games (when every hitter is retired by strikeout) occur every year.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/06/04/little-leaguer-throws-perfect-game-with-18-strikeouts/">Little Leaguer Throws Perfect Game with 18 Strikeouts</a> (87 words)</p>
