<h2>Celtics Accomplishments in Five Year Span</h2>
<p>The Celtics failed to win a championship after 2008. All of Boston is left to wonder &#8220;what if <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/261/kevin-garnett">Kevin Garnett</a> didn&#8217;t get hurt in 2009,&#8221; or &#8220;what if <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/2018/kendrick-perkins">Kendrick Perkins</a> didn&#8217;t blow out his knee in game 6 of 2010,&#8221; or &#8220;what if this team had <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/4240/avery-bradley">Avery Bradley</a> and <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/greenje02.html">Jeff Green</a>?&#8221; The fact is Garnett, Perkins, Bradley, and Green all did get hurt, and we are left with just one championship. People will wonder if this group of players truly reached its potential, and I think it did in more ways than one.</p>
<p>The Celtics&#8217; Big Three did what they set out to do,  win a championship. Not only did they win, but they continued to be competitive in the years to follow, and finished just shy of winning a second title in 2010. In the last five years the Celtics have won more playoff series than any other NBA franchise in that same time span. Every game, this team gave you everything they had and more, and we as fans were lucky enough to witness <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/9/ray-allen">Ray Allen</a>, <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/662/paul-pierce">Paul Pierce</a>, and Garnett play together for five seasons at the end of their respective primes.</p>
<h2>Emergence of Rajon Rondo</h2>
<p>Throughout it all we saw the emergence of the next Boston superstar in <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/rondora01.html">Rajon Rondo</a>. Having a trademark for being a hot-head, the veteran leaders of this team took Rondo under their wings. He began to go fearlessly to the hoop, and he made passes that had everyone in the arena ask &#8220;How did he get that there?&#8221; Boston, you have been treated to the type of Celtic basketball that past generations saw all the time. Boston, you were treated to Celtic basketball that would make the late Red Auerbach proud and with Rondo a major part of the team moving forward we can all continue to take pride in the Celtics.</p>
<h2>Future in Question as Allen and Garnett Hit Free Agency</h2>
<p>The future of this team is uncertain. If anything, the 2012 post-season run by this team is going to make it difficult for Ainge to blow this Celtic team up. Allen believes he still has plenty of basketball left in his legs, while Garnett has toyed with the idea of retirement. If Allen and Garnett don&#8217;t come back to the Celtic organization they will certainly be missed.</p>
<p>The Big Three&#8217;s time in Boston restored the passion of Celtic basketball. They were an intense group that only wanted to win, and they didn&#8217;t care how they did it. Whether Garnett and Allen come back or not is irrelevant. The only thing that matters is the fact that they were here, and that they won. I hope Boston fans are able to truly appreciate what we have been so lucky to witness these past five seasons. The Big Three brought basketball back to Boston. They brought winning back to the Celtics. But most importantly they helped us find our &#8216;Celtic Pride&#8217; again. On behalf of Boston sports fans everywhere, thank you for everything Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen.</p>

<h2>Celtics Grind Out Injury Plagued Regular Season</h2>
<p>From day one, the 2011-2012 Celtics were never given a chance. After falling to the Miami Heat in five games in the second round of the 2010-2011 playoffs, the critics all but counted the Celtics out entirely in the lockout shortened, condensed 2011-2012 season. In the first half of the season, the Celtics were doing everything to prove those critics right coasting into the All-Star break two games under .500.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/o/onealje01.html">Jermaine O&#8217;Neal</a> missed much of the season due to nagging injuries and would eventually need season ending wrist surgery. <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/greenje02.html">Jeff Green</a>, who was acquired in the deal that shipped <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/perkike01.html">Kendrick Perkins</a> to Oklahoma City last season, had a defect in his heart that would cause him to miss the entire season. Energetic forward Chris Wilcox would later be lost for the season with the same heart defect. In all, the Celtics would lose 3 of their projected top 10 players before the regular season was over. But through it all, as is Celtic tradition, they didn&#8217;t complain nor did they make a single excuse.</p>
<p>The 2011-2012 Celtics banded together to surge in the second half of the season. After the All-Star break the Celtics went 24-10, won the Atlantic Division, and gained the fourth seed in the playoffs. Role players <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bassbr01.html">Brandon Bass</a>, <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/pietrmi01.html">Mickael Pietrus</a>, <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bradlav01.html">Avery Bradley</a>, and <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/doolike01.html">Keyon Dooling</a> would step up throughout the season to make key contributions.</p>

Look for parts two and three on Wednesday and Friday.</em></h6>
<h2>What the Big 3 Meant to Boston</h2>
<p>When Danny Ainge made the moves in 2007 to acquire <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/allenra02.html">Ray Allen</a> and <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/garneke01.html">Kevin Garnett</a>, everyone in Boston knew that the Celtics had a great opportunity to win immediately. Ainge made additional key moves when he signed guys like <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/poseyja01.html">James Posey</a>, <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/houseed01.html">Eddie House</a>, and acquired <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/brownpj01.html">PJ Brown</a> at midseason to round out an already competitive roster. It appeared that right from the start this team clicked. Along with the three veterans they had a young point guard, Rajon Rondo, who was still coming into his own, and a young center, Kendrick Perkins, who proved to be an intimidating force on defense. The starting five was one of, if not, the best in the league, and proved to be a tough match-up for any opponent.</p>
<p>What made this team so good was their style of play and their reliance on the whole team as a unit instead of a one-man show. On any given night any one of the Celtic&#8217;s key players could step up and have a big game, or all of them could carry the team at different moments in a game to lead to balanced victories. Their play was completely unselfish, which was amazing considering the Big 3 were formerly three individual players who were the best on their team. They were used to having to put their teammates on their backs to give their teams a shot at victory. Now, they had each other to rely on. Now, they were finally part of a team.</p>
<h2>Mediocrity Plagued Celtic Basketball for a Whole Generation of Fans</h2>
<p>As a kid growing up a fan of Boston sports teams, I have definitely been spoiled with the amount of championships I have seen at the age of 21. The Red Sox and Patriots already had won titles by this point, but I had never had the privilege of watching good Celtic basketball like my dad did. He would always tell me about when &#8220;basketball was basketball,&#8221; sharing stories of Bird, Parrish, Russell, and Cousy. I was wow&#8217;ed by the stories but also jealous that I had only been able to watch the likes of <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/lafrera01.html">Raef Lafrentz</a> and <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bakervi01.html">Vin Baker</a>. <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/piercpa01.html">Paul Pierce</a> was a superstar playing on a team of nobodies and looked like he would never have the chance to fully reach his potential. I felt like I would never have the chance to fully appreciate how good Pierce was. Year in and year out trade rumors would swirl about shipping Pierce out of town in order to start over with some young prospects. Through it all Pierce stuck with the city and the team and continued to play basketball.</p>
<p>When Ainge made the trade, he did more than give the team a legitimate shot to win basketball games, he finally restored &#8220;Celtic Pride&#8221; back to Boston. Ainge gave this city a team that was worth cheering for. He gave this city a group of unselfish, smart, veteran players who only wanted one thing: to win a championship.</p>
<p>Watching the 2008 season was pure bliss. This was my chance to see a great Celtic team like those of the past. The best part of the whole season was that nothing was handed to these guys. They battled through two seven game series just to get to the Eastern Conference Finals. They didn&#8217;t win a road playoff game until they won in Detroit in the Eastern Conference Finals. They made everyone in Boston sweat every minute of every playoff game, and I loved it. This was the Celtic team we had all been waiting for since the Larry Bird days. To put the icing on the cake the Celtics had another shot at their rival, the Los Angeles Lakers, in the NBA Finals. It was the match-up everyone wanted and it was so fitting that the first time the Celtics were in the finals since 1987, it was against the Lakers.</p>
<h2>Game 4 of 2008 NBA Finals Quintessential to Big Three Era</h2>
<p>I can&#8217;t think of a better game to sum up this group of Celtic players than Game Four of the 2008 Finals. The Celtics were up 2-1 in the series but the Lakers had a led by more than 30 points in the second half of the game. It seemed destined to be tied up 2-2 after Game Four, but the Celtics mounted an incredible comeback and won the game 97-91. The sight of Paul Pierce walking down the hall after the game screaming &#8220;One More!,&#8221; is a sight no Boston fan should ever forget. Sure enough the Celtics were able to close out the series in game 6 in Boston, with Garnett shouting &#8220;Anything is possible,&#8221; in his court-side post-game interview.</p>
<p>The 2008 season gave everyone in Boston a basketball team they could be proud of. The storied season also showed everyone in Boston just how great of a Celtic player Pierce is. His best efforts were not enough to bring this team to the promised land on his own, but with the help of Allen and Garnett, Pierce&#8217;s greatness shone. Even with both of those all-stars joining his Celtic team, he never became selfish or greedy. Pierce never once said this was &#8220;my team.&#8221; Pierce welcomed his new star teammates with open arms and together they figured out a way to play phenomenally as a unit. This group of Celtics showed the world that winning is about team effort, and without a full cast of guys all contributing their part, nothing is possible. Thankfully, for this Celtics <em>team,</em> an NBA Championship was possible.</p>
