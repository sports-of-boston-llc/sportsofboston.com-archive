Nelson did not stay her decision pending appeals, which could force business as usual to commence immediately. The NFL will request a stay from Nelson, and has appealed to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. [&#8230;]]]></description>

Nelson did not stay her decision pending appeals, which could force business as usual to commence immediately. The NFL will request a stay from Nelson, and has appealed to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. The stay request is based on the notion that should the appeal be successful, the lockout would return at that time.</p>
<p>The NFLPA argued that the NFL was causing irreparable harm with their lockout, and the NFL argued that the decertification was a sham. While the NFLPA sure seems to be moving in lockstep, the decertification certainly looks like a sham, but at the same time, a lockout can derail careers and deprive Americans of their favorite pastime.</p>
<blockquote><p>The plaintiffs &#8220;have made a strong showing that allowing the League to continue their &#8216;lockout&#8217; is presently inflicting, and will continue to inflict, irreparable harm upon them, particularly when weighed against the lack of any real injury that would be imposed on the NFL by issuing the preliminary injunction,&#8221; Nelson wrote.</p></blockquote>

So what does this mean for regular fans? Well, two things really. First we’ll probably be able to get NFL (and specifically Patriots) gear for significantly cheaper than we get it now and, secondly, there may be a deluge of horrible football video games on the market where not every team (and player) is represented.</p>
<h2>Why Did This Case Happen?</h2>
<p>Ten years ago, the NFL signed an exclusive deal with Reebok which said Reebok had exclusive rights to use NFL team logos on all of their caps and hats. This, in turn, really pissed of a suburban Chicago clothing company, American Needle, which had been making NFL hats for the past fifty years. After the deal with Reebok, American Needle filed an Antitrust suit in Illinois arguing the deal hurt consumers and competition citing a spike in hat prices immediately following. Personally I think American Needle is right on. In this country, people (myself included) are so rabidly obsessed with their football team they’ll pay $35 for a run-of-the-mill hat.
