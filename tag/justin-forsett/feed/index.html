So, make sure to get all your superstars in there and make sure to bench players who have bad matchups before you have to play your bench players due to bye-week replacements. Here are some of my recommendations:</p>
<h2>Start &#8216;Em</h2>
<p><strong>Cam Newton (vs. New Orleans): </strong>The Saints&#8217; defense have the third-worst passer rating against QBs and Newton put up a huge game in Week 14 last year with three passing touchdowns and a rushing score. If you are planning to play Newton based on matchups, then this is one of those times to put him in your lineup.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/09/27/fantasy-football-start-em-sit-em-week-3-3/">Fantasy Football Start &#8216;Em, Sit &#8216;Em: Week 3</a> (444 words)</p>

Photo Courtesy MassLive.com." ></a><p>One of the surprises of the NFL season was the emergence of Ravens running back Justin Forsett. Forsett, who had bounced around several teams before landing in Baltimore, saw his chance early in the season in the aftermath of the Ray Rice domestic violence situation. Forsett seized the moment, running for 1,266 yards and eight touchdowns. He also averaged 5.4 yards per carry, which was good for one of the best marks in the league. His mix of power and speed as well as vision makes him difficult for the Patriots to defend. The Ravens offensive line has also done a good job opening holes for him and they show no signs of slowing down.</p>
<p>Most games are won and lost in the trenches and this week’s game will put the play of the Patriots’ defensive line into even greater focus than normal. If the Patriots allow Forsett to run as he has throughout the season they will have a tough time getting off the field, and it will open things up for the Ravens passing attack. There are two players above the rest that will need to play well for the Patriots to slow Forsett down: Vince Wilfork and Sealver Siliga.</p>
<p>Wilfork has been the anchor of the Patriots defense for a decade and the Patriots will need all of his 6’2” 325 pound frame to clog the middle of the line. Siliga is also 6’2” and hovering around 325 pounds next to Wilfork. Siliga missed eight games while on the Injured Reserve/Return list but has been healthy for the last four games. In the nine games that Siliga missed, the Patriots gave up an average of 122 rushing yards per game. That number nose-dived to 87 yards per game in the month of December once Siliga returned to action. Siliga and Wilfork together will need to push the middle of Baltimore’s offensive line back and come up with tackles for losses or force the Ravens to bounce runs outside. This will also mean Rob Ninkovich, Akeem Ayers, Chandler Jones, and Dont’a Hightower will need to be stout outside and in the second level.</p>
<p>The Patriots cannot miss tackles and allow Forsett to gain yards after contact. Forsett has to be met at the line of scrimmage and forced to move around before hitting the hole. If the Patriots can accomplish this, it will go a long way towards limiting his effectiveness. Alan Branch could also factor into stopping Forsett as well as being a key rusher up the middle. Wilfork and Siliga will not be able to play every snap so Branch will have to perform when he is called upon. Forcing the Ravens to be a one-dimensional passing team will allow the Patriots vaunted secondary to shine. This is the first postseason in nearly a decade that the Patriots will have a distinct advantage in the secondary against nearly any team they will play. However, if they do not stop Forsett, that advantage will not be as useful.</p>

Teams like the Cowboys, Vikings, and 49ers can&#8217;t seem to get out of their own way despite high preseason expectations, while surprise teams like the Chiefs and Buccaneers are riding high, at or near the top of their division&#8217;s standings. Think you know what&#8217;ll happen this week? &#8220;Not Friggin&#8217; Likely&#8221;… that&#8217;s what the new parity-filled NFL stands for these days. Acronyms are fun to play with, aren&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>Evidence of this runs rampant across my fantasy picks over the first quarter of the season. Sure I&#8217;ve had some swings and misses, but I&#8217;ve had just as many homers this season as well. I&#8217;m like the Rob Deer of fantasy football… I either crush it 500 feet or go down swinging on three straight pitches. Anyone else remember Rob Deer? Or am I the only one that&#8217;s nostalgic about the lousy Milwaukee Brewers teams of the early 90&#8217;s?

<p>We’re heading into October now, which means teams and players are starting to show who they really are for the 2010 season. Pittsburgh has showed they can win without Big Ben. Michael Vick has showed he can still be a team&#8217;s &#8220;top dog&#8221; (pun intended). And the Bills and Lions are still the Bills and Lions. Teams and players may be showing their true colors, but personally, me and my weekly picks seem to be struggling with an identity crisis. Week 1 was a triumphant one. Week 2, well not so much. Now, Week 3 turned out to be one where I accentuated the negative. I’m a positive kind of guy, this isn’t like me. But in Week 3, I nailed my “jokers,” and struck out with most of my “aces.” What can I say, I guess I have a keen eye for lack of talent.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/10/01/fantasy-fast-forward-nfl-week-4/">Fantasy Fast Forward: NFL Week 4</a> (3,260 words)</p>

<p>For the last few seasons, it&#8217;s been the Arizona Cardinals who have had a strangle hold on the top spot in this division, two years ago advancing to represent the NFC in the Super Bowl. Before the Cards held all the cards, it was Seattle who had a nice run of it for a couple of years, while Matt Hasselbeck was in his prime and Shaun Alexander was putting up MVP-caliber seasons. And way back, and I&#8217;m talking like new millennium way back, it was the high flying Rams who owned the throne, during their &#8220;Greatest Show on Turf&#8221; days.</p>
<p>Now the question is, are you on a new bandwagon this season? The bandwagon that seems to be busting at the seams? The bandwagon of the new sheriff in town? I speak of course, of the team that hasn&#8217;t been mentioned yet in this article… this year&#8217;s sexiest playoff pick… the San Francisco 49ers.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/08/31/nfc-west-fantasy-preview/">NFC West Fantasy Preview</a> (1,310 words)</p>

<p>Leagues with a Week 17 championship game can be a pain in the butt. This is the time of the season where most teams have clinched playoff spots and will be methodically resting starters in order to hopefully prevent injury. In fantasy land, this makes deciding who to start or who to pick up extremely difficult. But hey, I guess that is the challenge of a Week 17 championship.</p>
<h2>Week 17 Sleepers</h2>
<h3>Indianapolis @ Buffalo</h3>
<h4>Buffalo Bills Defense/Special Teams</h4>
<p>The Colts showed last week that they aren&#8217;t afraid to rest key players. They even ruined a perfect season to do it. There is no reason to think Indy won&#8217;t rest Peyton Manning and Co. again this week, maybe even more.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/12/30/week-17-sleepers/">Week 17 Sleepers</a> (736 words)</p>

Every Sunday, I make a frantic re-arrangement of my roster before the first kickoff. Two weeks ago, if I had played WR Chris Chambers, then his 119 yds would have let me win. This past week, if I had played Justin Forsett over Maurice Jones-Drew (Forsett was facing the Rams), then his 130 yds and 2 TD would have given me the edge by less than two points.</p>
