<p>It was the entire linebacking unit.</p>
<p>Tedy Bruschi, Mike Vrabel, Roosevelt Colvin, Adalius Thomas, and Junior Seau all branded smiles as they made the cover as a unit. Now they all have one thing in common. None of them are on the team.</p>
<p>Just three years later, the New England Patriots have an entirely new linebacking group that is looking to make a name for themselves. Their faces are not well know, but there is potential in the group. Perhaps they will earn their own way onto the cover of a magazine or two.</p>
<h2>THE STARTERS:</h2>
<p>The 2010 kickoff is still months away. Changes could be make, trades could happen and the landscape could change drastically. So for the preview, we will currently use the &#8220;unofficial&#8221; depth chart from Patriots.com.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/06/14/patriots-2010-preview-the-linebackers/">Patriots 2010 Preview: The Linebackers</a> (894 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rookie linebacker Tyrone McKenzie has torn his ACL and will miss the 2009 season for the Patriots. The Pats picked the South Florida alum in the third round as the 97th overall pick and he was expected to compete for a backup outside linebacker job. </p>
<p>McKenzie was hurt during a drill at rookie mini camp on Saturday when he collided with a running back. Even though McKenzie walked off on his own power, later tests revealed a right knee ACL tear.</p>
<p><strong>My Take:</strong> Anytime you see a recent draft pick go down it hurts. Many pundits saw McKenzie as a diamond in the rough, considering he played at three different colleges and has his best days in front of him. Thankfully the Patriots have a lot of young options at linebacker but it seemed as though McKenzie could&#8217;ve been a guy who was going to contribute in his rookie season.</p>
