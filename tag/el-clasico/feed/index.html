				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In the sixth and final edition of a week long preview of the Colts vs. Pats (deemed El Clásico after a world famous European football rivalry between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid), I’ll take a look at the quarterbacks and running backs for each team.</em></p>
<p><strong>Quarterbacks</strong><br />
<em>Patriots: Tom Brady</em>: Brady is putting on a show for the ages. 30 touchdown passes, two interceptions in just eight games. Brady is on pace to shatter Peyton Manning&#8217;s record for most TDs in a season and leads an offense who just might set a few records themselves. Brady has an potent arsenal at his disposal and has taken advantage of it. On Sunday he just needs to keep it going. If he has time in the pocket, he shouldn&#8217;t have trouble finding open receivers. If he has to scramble, then the game plan will have to change and the Patriots could be in trouble. Brady knows what he has to do, and will be looking to avenge last  year&#8217;s poor result in the AFC title game.</p>
<p><em>Colts: Peyton Manning</em>: After years of waiting, Manning finally got his Super Bowl ring last year. Though he was more of a hindrance to his team throughout the playoffs (three TDs, seven picks), he was able to finally come through in the clutch and beat the Pats in a meaningful game. It&#8217;s the same story for Manning this Sunday, stay on his feet, find the open receivers. It might be tougher for Manning because LT Tony Ugoh is hurting and the rookie protects Manning&#8217;s blindside. Manning does have the advantage of a more proven running game this time around but faces a stinger defense Sunday than he&#8217;s faced all season.</p>
<p><strong>The Verdict:</strong> It&#8217;s the best of the best on Sunday. These two will go down as two of the best quarterbacks ever to strap on the pads. As Sunday looks, Manning has won three straight in the match up, but Brady has never had a receiver like Moss to throw to. Both QBs should have big games, but Brady is looking sharper than ever. <strong>Edge: Patriots</strong><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In the fifth edition of a week long preview of the Colts vs. Pats (deemed El Clásico after a world famous European football rivalry between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid), I’ll take a look at the wide receivers and tight ends for each team.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wide Receivers</strong><br />
<em>Patriots: Randy Moss, Donte Stallworth, Wes Welker</em>: The receiving corps for the Patriots has been nothing short of incredible. Randy Moss is leading the world in nearly every category (779 yards, 11 TDs) and has revitalized his career in New England. He is a threat that Tom Brady has never had in his arsenal. Moss has made big catch after big catch and is a true deep threat on every play. He&#8217;ll demand double coverage on Sunday and it will be important for him to establish the threat of going deep. The Colts do not employ several risky defensive schemes, they mostly use Cover 2 &#8211; a defense which has both safeties covering deep. What&#8217;s most likely to happen Sunday is that Moss and Stallworth be sent long to take Bob Sanders out of the equation. This will open up the re-born Wes Welker, Ben Watson and the running backs to control the underneath. The linebackers will be forced to cover passing threats which leads to Brady having oodles of time in the pocket. Even with double coverage on the outside and deep, if Brady has time, Moss will get open. The Patriots balanced passing attack fits perfectly against a Cover 2, which should mean another big day for Welker and Ben Watson. Don&#8217;t be surprised if Moss ends up with just three catches, but one of them being a 45-yard TD catch.</p>
<p><em>Colts: Marvin Harrison, Reggie Wayne, Anthony Gonzalez</em>: Perhaps I should include Dallas Clark in this group but I&#8217;ll hold off. First a disclaimer: Harrison is listed as doubtful for the game but I&#8217;ll include him as though he were playing. Harrison and Wayne are the class pair of NFL receivers. They run routes to perfection and are threats both underneath and deep. Wayne is having a career year (on pace for 1,200 yards and 10 TDs) and rookie Anthony Gonzalez is finally getting involved in the offense. Whomever lines up at wideout, Peyton Manning will make them look like a star. If Harrison plays, it might only be in limited action which can only help the Pats. Asante Samuel will most likely line up against Wayne even if Harrison does play, and Samuel must keep Wayne from running rampant. Manning loves to find his receivers on deep seam routes when near the red zone, thus the Patriots safeties will need to stay home and not over commit. The Colts receivers always show up in big games, and it will take a whole team effort to keep Wayne, Gonzalez and Harrison from lighting up the scoreboard.</p>
<p><strong>The Verdict:</strong> These teams represent the two best wide receiver corps in the league. Year after year, Harrison and Wayne have made life difficult for opposing secondaries. The Patriots on the other hand have a brand new trio, but a tandem who has bought into the system and run it like well oiled machine. When predicting who will do better, the key is Harrison. He is as listed as doubtful and while many pundits feel he&#8217;ll play because he&#8217;s a gamer, he will not be 100%. Though a 50% Harrison is better than most other WRs at 100%, the Pats receivers are simply too balanced to be stopped. Wayne could have a huge day, but Wes Welker again will prove his worth and torch the slot. <strong>Edge: Patriots</strong><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In the fourth edition of a week long preview of the Colts vs. Pats (deemed El Clásico after a world famous European football rivalry between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid), I’ll take a look at the offensive and defensive lines for each team.</em></p>
<p><strong>Defensive Lines</strong><br />
<em>Patriots: Ty Warren, Vince Wilfork, Richard Seymour, Jarvis Green</em>: The defensive front three for the Patriots are the anchor of the 3-4 scheme which Bill Belichick has resurrected in the past seven seasons. The three presumed starters are all former first round picks and all play their position well. Warren came into his own in 2006 and Vince Wilfork &#8211; despite dropping 25 pounds in the off-season &#8211; is still a bohemith in the middle and usually takes up two offensive linemen. Richard Seymour missed the first seven weeks with a knee injury and played in limited snaps against the Redskins last week. If he can only play a small number of snaps, Jarvis Green proved his worth in Seymour&#8217;s absence and is a very able backup &#8211; leading the defensive line with three sacks on the year. The goal for the Pats D line is simple, clog the run to stop Joseph Addai from busting through the gut and get some sort of pressure on Manning. Whether it&#8217;s Seymour on the edge or simply taking up offensive line bodies to open up Vrabel and Colvin, the D line has to win the battle in the trenches to make life uncomfortable for Peyton &#8220;Cut That Meat&#8221; Manning.</p>
<p><em>Colts: Robert Mathis, Raheem Brock, Ed Johnson, Dwight Freeney</em>: The defensive line is the most improved part of the 2007 undefeated Colts. Mathis and Freeney can be terrors on the end, accounting for 5.5 sacks this season. The key player to watch of course in Freeney, who will be matched up against Matt Light. The interior defensive line will have trouble against a good set of Patriots guards and center Dan Koppen, but if Freeney and Mathis start getting pressure on Tom Brady we might see a lot more two TE sets from the Patriots, who like to use the three wide receiver, one TE set.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Both defensive lines must get push against solid offensive lines on the other side. Unlike the Colts however, the Patriots three (and sometimes just two) down lineman don&#8217;t need sacks and tackles to have a huge impact. With a far superior set of linebackers behind them, Warren, Wilfork and Seymour/Green just need to clog the gaps and take up bodies to let Bruschi, Vrabel and Co. do their work. Rookie LT Tony Ugoh has been impressive this year, but the Colts haven&#8217;t faced a defense nearly this quick. I see Warren coming up with a big play and Wilfork having a massive (no pun intended) impact in the middle. I see both LT Matt Light and RT Nick Kazur being able to limit the damage from Freeney and Mathis. <strong>Edge: Patriots</strong><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In the third edition of a week long preview of the Colts vs. Pats (deemed El Clásico after a world famous European football rivalry between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid), I’ll take a look at the linebackers for each team.</em></p>
<p><strong>Patriots</strong><br />
<em>Mike Vrabel, Tedy Bruschi, Adalius Thomas, Junior Seau, Roosevelt Colvin</em>: The Patriots possess the most dangerous set of linebackers in the NFL. They have speed, strength and a half century worth of years in experience. With the return of Junior Seau this season, the Patriots also gained depth at middle linebacker. Bruschi has been very consistent this season, leading the team with 48 tackles. Adalius Thomas has come as advertised, mainly playing in the middle but has been very versatile. He has 38 tackles and half sack this year and had perhaps the defensive play of the year when he intercepted a Phillip Rivers pass and returned it to the house in Week 2, outrunning a few receivers in the process. His raw size and speed are incredible and he&#8217;ll have the job of bumping Dallas Clark off the line and stuffing the run of Joseph Addai. The real key to Sunday&#8217;s game from a linebacker point of view is off the edge. Mike Vrabel is the most underrated player in the NFL, as he showed his might last week with a TD catch and two forced fumbles. He leads the team with a 7.5 sacks and looks very comfortable back in his natural position. Roosevelt Colvin also must be able to put pressure on Peyton Manning or he will torch the vulnerable Patriots secondary.</p>
<p><strong>Colts</strong><br />
<em>Rocky Boiman, Tyjuan Hagler, Greg Brackett, Freddie Keiaho</em>: The Colts linebackers have come as advertised this year.  None of them will blow you away with athleticism, and outside of Brackett none have any notoriety. Throughout the season the linebackers have been able to stuff the run with some success and have more of a smash mouth attitude after their Super Bowl victory last season. As I pointed out in my preview of the secondaries, both cornberbacks on the Colts have more tackles than any linebacker. Brackett, Boiman and Keiaho&#8217;s job Sunday will be to stuff the run of Maroney, sniff out screens to Faulk and at times try to cover Ben Watson &#8211; if he plays. Watson is one of the fastest TEs in the NFL and it remains to be seen if he can be covered by any of the Colts linebackers. A lot of their success Sunday will depend on how the front four are able to push the Patriots offensive line to open up holes in order to put pressure on Tom Brady. The Colts linebackers have a tough job to complete on Sunday against an outstanding offensive line and a speedy TE.</p>
<p><strong>The Verdict:</strong> In probably the most lopsided comparison, the Patriots linebackers are superior at each position. Vrabel and Colvin come off the edge with reckless abandon and the trio of Bruschi, Seau and Thomas in the middle will make life hard for Addai. The Pats have a better linebacker corps than any other team in the NFL and they need to play like it this Sunday to stop the Colts offensive juggernaught. <strong>Edge: Patriots</strong></p>
<p>Check back tomorrow as I&#8217;ll preview the offensive and defense lines.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In the second edition of a week long preview of the Colts vs. Pats (deemed El Clásico after a world famous European football rivalry between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid), I’ll take a look at the secondaries of each team.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cornerbacks</strong><br />
<em>Asante Samuel/Ellis Hobbs/Randall Gay</em>: In analyzing all aspects of the Patriots roster, it&#8217;s obvious that the most vulnerability comes in the secondary, particularly the cornerbacks. The return of Asante Samuel from his quasi-holdout was extremely important as he is the shutdown corner on the roster. Hobbs has evolved into a pretty good CB, but has yet to show the consistency needed to be considered an elite corner in the league. Randall Gay has fought hard to get back from injury this year and has played pretty well overall. Samuel has finally started to get back in the swing of things, accounting for 17 tackles and a team high four interceptions so far this season. With the Colts running a multitude of three WR sets and the ever dangerous &#8220;tight end&#8221; Dallas Clark in the slot, Gay will be called upon to keep big plays from happening. Samuel loves to jump routes &#8211; as he did for a pick six in the AFC title game in January &#8211; but the Colts know this and could burn Samuel deep.</p>
<p><em>Kelvin Hayden/Marlin Jackson</em>: The Colts seemed to lose a lot on defense in the off-season &#8211; notably Cato June and Nick Webster &#8211; but their corners have played pretty well. Both Hayden and Jackson only have one pick to their name, but they&#8217;ve prevented big plays all season. One warning sign however is their combined 94 tackles, which is quite high for cornerbacks only halfway through the season. Their job will be to do something no team has been able to do in 2007, stop the Patriots passing attack. Hayden and Jackson will cover Moss and Stallworth but it looks like Bob Sanders will be in charge of covering the seemingly unstoppable Wes Welker in the slot.</p>
<p><strong>The Verdict:</strong> Each set of cornerbacks will be up against a stiff test. Even if Marvin Harrison doesn&#8217;t play, Reggie Wayne, Dallas Clark and Anthony Gonzalez are a lethal tandem. Samuel has a knack for coming up with a big play in a big game and he must on Sunday to win. On the Colts side, Hayden and Jackson need to keep Moss and Stallworth in front of them. It&#8217;s not easy, as Moss is a master at jump balls and Stallworth can run after the catch like no other in the league. I see both teams struggling to stop the opposing offenses, but the Patriots do have a shutdown corner in Samuel who could make a game changing play. <strong>Edge: Patriots</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In the first of week long preview of the Colts vs. Pats (deemed El Clásico after a world famous European football rivalry between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid), I&#8217;ll take a look at the special teams and coaching of each team.</em></p>
<p><strong>Coaching:</strong><br />
<em>Bill Belichick</em>: What is there left to say about coach Bill Belichick. Genius. Relentless. <em>Legend</em>. He&#8217;s the greatest coach of our generation and perhaps the greatest coach of all-time. The allegations of spygate and the effect the situation has on his legacy is now an afterthought. Belichick &#8211; along with offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels and defensive coordinator Dean Peas &#8211; gameplans better than anyone. From week to week, Belichick and his staff develop diverse strategies which will keep opposing defenses on their toes. Belichick&#8217;s credentials are unquestionable and though he&#8217;s deflected media attention from this game, you know he&#8217;s been gameplanning how to beat the Colts since that fateful day last January.</p>
<p><em>Tony Dungy</em>: One of the more underrated coaches in the NFL, all Dungy has done is take a team which couldn&#8217;t get over the hump with a great quarterback to starting multiple half seasons undefeated and winning the Super Bowl in the 2006 season. Much is made of Peyton Manning&#8217;s success having a lot to do with the stability of the coaching staff &#8211; he&#8217;s had the same offensive coordinator for his entire career. But Dungy came from Tampa Bay to Indianapolis to build a championship defense and may have finally found the right combination of speed and strength. The Colts despise being called a &#8220;finesse team&#8221; and won the Super Bowl last year <em>because</em> of their defense, not in spite of it. Dungy, Manning and Co. finally found a way to beat the Patriots in the playoffs last year and seemed to gain a psychological edge. With a new smash mouth style defense, on display in the impressive MNF win over Jacksonville last week, Dungy has his team hitting on all cylinders heading into Sunday.<br />
