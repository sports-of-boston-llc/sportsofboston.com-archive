Andrew Miller was a huge factor coming out of the bullpen this series, most of the time leaving The Sox batters swinging at air.  Ben Cherington is the vice president of baseball operations in Toronto.  So basically, Francona and Miller are playing against Cherington, winner plays Theo Epstein and Jon Lester in the World Series.  Jeesh, imagine having all these guys in the same organization.  Oh wait they were, and the ownership screwed it up.</p>
<p>Dave Dombrowski doesn&#8217;t get a pass on this season either.  Aaron Hill, Fernando Abad, Brad Ziegler, and Drew Pomeranz were Dombrowski&#8217;s moves at the deadline.  These guys were a non factor, except for Pomeranz who gave up a 2 run BOMB to Coco Crisp, essentially losing the game.  How about David Price&#8217;s deal?  He got a 7 year, $217 million dollar deal from Dombroski, a deal that will ultimately end up being a failure, if it&#8217;s not already.  For a guy that was supposed to come in and turn things around, Dombrowski has been a letdown as president of baseball operations thus far.</p>
<p>Winning the series at Fenway last night meant a lot to Terry Francona, you could tell by the way he was reacting on the field.  He knows when he was fired that ownership was stirring up rumors about him, and last night he left with the last laugh.  I&#8217;m sure Jon Lester was laughing somewhere too, remember that horrible offer The Sox gave him?  4 years for $70 million?  Then they turn around and give Price 7 years for $217 million, what a joke.  You know what you had in Lester, he could handle the Boston spotlight and he could win in the playoffs.  Two things that David Price can not do.</p>
<p>This team needs a shake up and ownership has to provide it, and as of now it seems like it&#8217;s not going to happen.  Dombrowski just announced Farrell will be back next season.</p>
<p>Ortiz retired and Farrell coming back.  Just doesn&#8217;t seem right.</p>

<p>The Red Sox should have won this series pretty easily, but now?  The Yankees are only 3 games back of The Sox in the standings.  The Yankees are not a good team.  They unloaded at the trade deadline by trading, Andrew Miller, Aroldis Chapman, and Carlos Beltran.  New York pretty much waved the white flag at the deadline, and now they have hope.  I&#8217;m not saying The Yankees are a threat in the division or the wild card.  The point is these are the games you have to win when you&#8217;re fighting for a playoff spot.</p>
<p>The Red Sox had a lead going into the 7th inning in all 3 games of the series.  They lost two of those games.  The one game they did win, they walked the bases loaded in the ninth.  This Red Sox bullpen is putrid.  It seems like they can&#8217;t get anyone out, especially when there are guys on base.  It seems like this pitching staff has no guts.  They can&#8217;t get the big strikeout when the pressures on, it seems like they get tight and timid.</p>
<p>This series wasn&#8217;t all the pitching staffs fault.  What happen to the offense?  Just about a month ago they were crushing the baseball.  Now?  They have 2 hits in their last 29 attempts with the bases loaded.  This offense is much to talented to go into slumps like this.  Speaking of slumps, why does it seem the whole team goes in one giant slump at the same time?  It seems like this team is lacking confidence right now.  They could really use a benches clearing brawl to wake them up, or you know they could fire the manager.</p>
<p>They start a 3 game series with Arizona tonight, it&#8217;s safe to say sweeping The Diamondbacks is a must.  Especially with the tough road games on the horizon.</p>

<p>I truly don&#8217;t understand why people are hesitant to give up young prospects like, Moncada, or Benintendi, for a STUD like Sale.  Especially with this being Ortiz last season, I feel like you have to go all in and try to win now.  With Betts, Bradley, and Bogaerts there&#8217;s already a young nucleus in place, and it&#8217;s not like The Sox are an old team.  The way David Price has been pitching this season might also push Dombrowski to make a move for Sale.  Price hasn&#8217;t exactly pitched like an ace this season, so the opportunity to get one at the trade deadline could put The Sox over the top.</p>
<p>When The Sox included Hanley Ramirez in the deal for Mike Lowell, and Josh Beckett people in Boston were not happy.  Hanley went on to be one of the best players in the league for a stretch of time.  How did The Red Sox do after that?  They won a world series, and Hanley was long forgotten.  The point is if you have a chance to win A World Series you do it.  Their will always be another 18 year old prospect, their will never be another David Ortiz, do right by him and go all in for Sale.</p>

<p>If Pomeranz is going to succeed in Boston, he&#8217;s going to have to develop another pitch.  The one thing I noticed last night is mostly all of Pomeranz pitches come into right handed batters, which with the wall in left field is a recipe for disaster.  A changeup could be Pomeranz best friend if he learns how to throw one, a pitcher with his skills should be able to develop one.  The one thing that Red Sox fans should be concerned about is the last batter Pomeranz faced last night.  It was a bunt play, and Pomeranz didn&#8217;t get off the mound too quick, honestly it looked like he was just trying to get off the field at that point.</p>
<p>All and all I think Pomeranz will be fine in Boston, if he&#8217;s not he will see how brutal Boston can be if you can&#8217;t perform.</p>

<p>If the Red Sox are going to make a legit run this season there is a few things they have to do.  First is firing the manager.  This recent bad play isn&#8217;t all Farrell&#8217;s fault you can also blame the players, but yet you can&#8217;t just fire the players.  David Price has a 10.38 era in his last 2 starts, and is having the worst season of his career.  Stephen Wright has also been less than stellar in his last 2 starts, posting an era of 6.52.  The players aren&#8217;t performing the way they should be and it&#8217;s time to give this team a wake up call.  I&#8217;d hate to see someone lose their job over other people&#8217;s performance, however it&#8217;s the only way to save this season.</p>

It might be easy to say that it&#8217;s not surprising that Buchholz struggled against a Rangers team with the best record in the American League, especially with how Buchholz&#8217;s season has gone this year. But John Farrell used his faith in Buchholz to justify not bringing up a reliever from Pawtucket a night after <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8185&amp;position=P">Steven Wright</a> did not make it out of the fifth inning, and two nights after <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=3184&amp;position=P">David Price</a> didn&#8217;t make it out of the third. Most Red Sox fans already knew that faith was misguided, and were not surprised when Buchholz allowed the first six batters he faced to reach base, putting giving the Rangers an immediate lead they would not give up. Buchholz also walked more batters (5) than he struck out (3), further illustrating why he was demoted to the bullpen earlier in the season. Sadly the Red Sox find themselves thin on options as far as starting pitching is concerned, but there really is no reason to send Buchholz back out for another start. He has had more than his fair share of chances in Boston, and he has proven that the only thing he can be counted on to do is under-perform.</p>
<p>A few more notes from Sunday&#8217;s game:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=10607&amp;position=OF">Bryce Brentz</a> went 2-for-3 with a solo homer, the first of his Major League career. It will be interesting to see if the Red Sox try to get Brentz some playing time in Left Field going forward, as his bat could be starting to heat up. His main competition in Left, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=10700&amp;position=OF">Ryan LaMarre</a>, has done absolutely nothing with the bat since coming up from Pawtucket, so there should be plenty of playing time available for whoever is performing at the moment.</li>

In the beginning of the season, Blake Swihart was the starting catcher. Not too long after that he started to lose time to Ryan Hanigan and Christian Vazquez. Soon after Vazquez was thrown into the mix, Swihart was not seen again at the catching position and was dropped down to the AAA Pawtucket Red Sox.</p>
<p>For the majority of the season, Vazquez has been the everyday catcher with Hanigan catching a game or two here and there. But on June 5th Hanigan suffered a neck strain and was put on the 15 day DL. So most recently we have seen Vazquez sharing time at catcher with Sandy Leon, who is batting 10 for 16 (.625) on the season. Vazquez has seen significantly more time than any other catcher the Sox have had this year, but I question this. Christian is batting only .221 this year but is a pretty good defensive catcher with a strong arm. I just question why with a guy like Leon who has been hitting very well when he gets in, doesn&#8217;t see a little more playing time. I understand he&#8217;s only had 16 at bats, but when a guy is that hot coming into his first at bats of the season, you usually keep him in and see what he can do.</p>
<p>The biggest question the Sox face is who is going to be their left fielder. I feel like every time I watch them there&#8217;s someone different in left. The Sox started the season with Brock Holt as their starting left fielder. He played pretty much every day in left and performing at an average rate. But when he suffered a concussion on May 20th, he was put on the DL and hasn&#8217;t returned since. Holt is recovering from a concussion slower than normally but concussions are taken much more seriously now a days since we know so much more about the dangers of them. Holt is currently rehabbing with the Paw Sox and he is batting 3 for 6, with two doubles in two games. His return date to the Red Sox is uncertain but I can imagine when he get&#8217;s back he will be thrown right back into the lineup to see how he performs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when Holt was gone, left field saw action from mainly two different players; Chris Young and Blake Swihart. When Swihart was sent down to the minors, he decided that his best chance at playing for the Red Sox would be to switch to outfield and compete for the left field spot. Being the athletic and quick player he is, he transformed himself into a surprisingly well outfielder. Him and Chris Young would split time with each other in left. But Swihart was placed n the 15 day DL when he severely sprained his ankle running into a wall. So this leaves Chris Young alone, who has been playing left almost every day for the Sox and performing fairly well. He is batting .282 on the season and has had some big hits for the Sox this season. He has turned himself into a guy that we could see as an everyday player in the outfield.</p>
<p>But the thing is, when Holt finally comes back the Sox are going to put him back in left to compete with Young. Which is fair because he lost his starting spot due to injury. However it is not a given that Brock will just get his starting spot back because he was only batting .239 at the time of his injury, so it&#8217;s going to be a battle between the two. And when Swihart returns from his injury, who knows what&#8217;s going to happen because he was also hitting and playing fairly well in left.</p>
<p>Now the problem I have with all of this is that many teams don&#8217;t play well when there&#8217;s constant changes to the starting lineup. Most teams have the same guys at the same positions for the majority of the games. The Red Sox seem to have a different lineup every night. Whether its the catcher, the left fielder, the second baseman, or Ortiz has a day off; its always different. Having too many changes to a lineup too often can screw up the flow or momentum of a team. I blame a good amount of losses to this problem. John Farrell has made many Sox fans angry this year with his questionable choices in just about any decision he makes. As the season goes on, Farrell needs to make up his mind of who his every day players are because playing musical chairs with these guys all year just isn&#8217;t going to work.</p>

In a match-up with one of the very best in the game in Madison Bumgarner, Price was as sharp as he&#8217;s been all season long, spotting his fastball and making quick work of an opportunistic Giant&#8217;s lineup. The only problem? The Red Sox offense, who has carried Price through his lackluster start of the season with tremendous run support, forgot to show up.</p>
<p>John Farrel has to take the lion&#8217;s share of the blame, as he made what I believed to be a huge blunder in the final inning. With men on first and second and just one out, the struggling Travis Shaw was due up to bat. Shaw has looked absolutely lost at the plate as of late, and Farrel should have pinch hit Rutledge or Hernandez for Shaw in this spot. Instead, Farrell elected to take the bat out of the hands of the hottest hitter on the team in Chris Young, and Shaw struck out on a breaking ball in the dirt.</p>
<p>Let me be clear- I am not among the contingency who believe that the Sox are winning despite John Farrell. I think he&#8217;s done a fine job this season, and he&#8217;s earned the right to be at the helm through the playoff push. But some of his in-game decisions this year have been baffling to say the least, and it&#8217;s going to catch up with him at some point or another.</p>
<p>While the loss was certainly frustrating, my big takeaway was the performance of the man brought in to be the ace of this staff.  Price looked like the confident, controlled pitcher we all remember from his days of mowing down lineups in Tampa and Detroit, and he outlasted one of the baseball&#8217;s elite in Bumgarner last night. He got stronger as the game went on, with his fastball touching 95 as late as the 7th and 8th ininngs. Once again, Price was once again done-in by the long ball, which has been the crux of his struggles all season long.</p>
<p>So yeah, the Sox split the mini-series with the Giants, but this series may ultimately be remembered as the moment when David Price found &#8220;it&#8221; for the first time in a Red Sox uniform. Despite their potent lineup, the Sox won&#8217;t be a true contender without a dominant Price come October.</p>

<p>On a positive note David Price and Stephen Wright have been good of late.  Yes Price lost his last start, but it was really the offense and bullpen that lost that game.  He Pitched 7 innings and gave up 3 runs in which only 2 of them were earned.  Stephen Wright has been magnificent of late, he has pitched 3 complete games this season, to put that into perspective Clayton Kershaw has pitched 3 complete games also.  The Sox need to get another starter at the deadline and need these two to continue to pitch well.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not all bad for The Sox, they do have one thing going for them.  They are very very relentless.  With the bullpen and starting pitching giving up home runs which seems like once an inning, the offense has done their part to keep the team in the game.  Today&#8217;s game was a perfect example, being no hit into the 8th inning they had that never quit attitude and almost tied the game in the bottom of the ninth.  This Red Sox offense give them a chance to win every single game.</p>
<p>The starting pitching has to get better for them to make serious run.  With Baltimore and Toronto on their heels it&#8217;s time for pitching to turn this around.</p>

<p><strong>Starting PItching</strong></p>
<p>The Red Sox can obviously use some help in the starting rotation.  With Eduardo Rodriguez scheduled to make his first start this tuesday, he&#8217;s not the guy you want to pencil in as the number 2 in this rotation.  Here&#8217;s a few guys The Sox should go after.</p>
<p>Justin Verlander:</p>
<p>Verlander is 4-4 on the season with an era of 4.02.  He has been there before in the playoffs, and is a guy that can be trusted.  However he is 33 years old and his contract is ridiculous.  He is making 28 million dollars this season and the following 3 seasons, then in 2020 he will be making 22 million.  This is a lot of money to be dishing out for a 33-year-old.  However, don&#8217;t forget that Dombrowski is the guy that gave him this money.  Plus the Red Sox have their own bad contract in Pablo Sandoval, if the two teams can work something out we&#8217;re both sides eat money on their respective guys then this trade is completely possible.</p>
<p>Sonny Gray:</p>
<p>Gray is 3-5 on the season with an era of 6.19, however he is a much better than his stats show.  He is only 26 years old and would likely be a rental.  His contract this year is only for 512k and is available for arbitration for the next 3 seasons.</p>
<p>Julio Teheran:</p>
<p>Teheran is 1-4 on the season, however his era is 2.45.  Pitching for Atlanta Teheran doesn&#8217;t get any run support.  Teheran is known as one of the best young pitchers in baseball and will be a trade target for multiple teams at the trade deadline.</p>
<p>The Sox are also in need for end of the bullpen help, tho relief pitchers are difficult to foresee who will be available at the deadline.  All and all it is a definite that Dombrowski will make a move at the deadline, and I&#8217;m sure it will be a big move.</p>
