				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mark Fidrych, also known as &#8220;The Bird,&#8221; was found dead outside his Northborough, Mass. home Monday afternoon. Fidrych, 54, was working under his pickup truck when he was killed during an accident. He was found by a family friend under his truck on his farm at around 2:30 p.m.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bird&#8221; won the AL Rookie of the Year while pitching with the Detroit Tigers in 1976, and was known for his eccentric behavior while on the mound. He last played in the majors in 1980 and retired from the game in 1983 after a short career.<br />
