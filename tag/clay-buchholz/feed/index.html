It might be easy to say that it&#8217;s not surprising that Buchholz struggled against a Rangers team with the best record in the American League, especially with how Buchholz&#8217;s season has gone this year. But John Farrell used his faith in Buchholz to justify not bringing up a reliever from Pawtucket a night after <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8185&amp;position=P">Steven Wright</a> did not make it out of the fifth inning, and two nights after <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=3184&amp;position=P">David Price</a> didn&#8217;t make it out of the third. Most Red Sox fans already knew that faith was misguided, and were not surprised when Buchholz allowed the first six batters he faced to reach base, putting giving the Rangers an immediate lead they would not give up. Buchholz also walked more batters (5) than he struck out (3), further illustrating why he was demoted to the bullpen earlier in the season. Sadly the Red Sox find themselves thin on options as far as starting pitching is concerned, but there really is no reason to send Buchholz back out for another start. He has had more than his fair share of chances in Boston, and he has proven that the only thing he can be counted on to do is under-perform.</p>
<p>A few more notes from Sunday&#8217;s game:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=10607&amp;position=OF">Bryce Brentz</a> went 2-for-3 with a solo homer, the first of his Major League career. It will be interesting to see if the Red Sox try to get Brentz some playing time in Left Field going forward, as his bat could be starting to heat up. His main competition in Left, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=10700&amp;position=OF">Ryan LaMarre</a>, has done absolutely nothing with the bat since coming up from Pawtucket, so there should be plenty of playing time available for whoever is performing at the moment.</li>

The heralded ace David Price has been good this season with a 7-3 record and 91 strikeouts, but his 4.63 ERA leaves plenty of room for improvement. Then there is Steven Wright, who has unexpectedly taken over the second spot in the rotation through his stellar consistency. The knuckle ball profile fits more in the middle to back end of a pitching staff, but Wright&#8217;s impressive performance and lack of a viable alternative have propelled him to the front in the rotation.</p>
<p>Rick Porcello follows Wright in the rotation. The twenty-seven year old had an exciting start to the season but has since seen his ERA creep over four in June, which lends itself to some concerns. The return of Eduardo Rodriguez is a welcome addition and can help boost the rotation if he performs, but doubts about the overall quality and depth of the pitching staff are imminent.</p>
<p>After Price there are some critical questions that need to be addressed, and it begins with Steven Wright. Is he really a top two starter for a potential division winner? There is no doubt he has been outstanding this year, the most consistent pitcher on the team, but the unreliable nature of the knuckleball is a tad concerning. It would behoove the Red Sox to see an emergence from either Porcello or Rodriguez as consistent performance from one of these two traditional pitchers would help stabilize the top of the rotation and ease any excessive expectations of Steven Wright.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with the rotation is the vacancy left by disastrous seasons from both Clay Buchholz and Joe Kelly. Buchholz has the potential to rebound from his demotion to the bullpen if he can find his command, but Kelly on the other hand is a lost cause. Even worse, in his last start with Pawtucket Kelly left the game after four and two thirds innings with an apparent groin injury.</p>
<p>Thanks to the friendly nature of the Red Sox schedule until mid June, John Farrell announced that he will employ a four man rotation until June 18th. At that point he wants someone to grab the role of fifth starter and demand that spot through their performance. This offers an opportunity not only to the incumbents Buchholz and Kelly, but also Henry Owens and Roenis Elias whom have both spent most of the season in Pawtucket.</p>
<p>If these problems with the pitching staff are not addressed from within the organization the front office will have to make a trade. This is potentially problematic because the market for quality pitching at this season&#8217;s trade deadline appears minimal. The two top options are Sonny Gray of the Oakland Athletics and the Atlanta Braves&#8217; Julio Teheran, both of whom will demand a healthy package of top prospects in return.</p>
<p>In an ideal world the team will find a resolution from within the organization, but earlier this week Dave Dombrowski announced he is looking for both starting and relief pitching help before the August 1st deadline. It remains to be seen how the situation will unfold, but pitching is a key element of success for any baseball team and Red Sox could use some help both in rotation and the bullpen as they prepare for a pennant race and playoff run.</p>

He was expected to settle into Boston&#8217;s rotation and this anticipation had cultivated an anxious hope that he could build on an impressive rookie campaign. That anxiety boiled for over three months after the injury. The Red Sox front office exercised caution with Rodriguez through his rehab program, and then kept him in Pawtucket for five starts before recalling him. On Tuesday night at Camden Yards,  Rodriguez was finally ready for his debut with the Red Sox and he handled the occasion in stride. He threw 89 pitches over the course of six full innings, allowing just two earned on six hits and no walks.</p>
<p>The offense opened the game with back-to-back solo home runs by Mookie Betts and Dustin Pedroia, and by the bottom of the second inning the Red Sox had a five run advantage. Rodriguez did not relinquish that lead. He used his fastball early in counts and then worked in a sharp change-up to strike out three batters.</p>
<p>The essential aspect of Rodriguez outing was that it quieted worries about his velocity that had risen when he did not feature 95 mph heater during his starts in Pawtucket. Against the Orioles, he consistently sat around 92 mph with the fastball but touched 94 mph and as he continues to regain both arm and lower body strength the velocity should continue to return.</p>
<p>The addition of Eduardo Rodriguez to the roster adds a sense of insurance to a pitching staff that has some holes with neither Clay Buchholz nor Joe Kelly having proven himself capable of retiring MLB hitters. Buchholz was the man relegated to the bullpen in response to Rodriguez&#8217;s return and after Kelly&#8217;s disastrous outing last night he was optioned to Pawtucket. which leaves a void in the rotation. It remains to be seen how the Red Sox will fill this vacancy but Rodriguez&#8217;s presence should help take some pressure off of the pitching staff as a unit.</p>
<p>His return also presents a precarious situation for the front office. Rodriguez activation from the disabled list feels like the prize of a trade deadline deal. As the deadline approaches this acquisition will have to effect the front office&#8217;s decision making. While it remains to be seen how this process will unfold but there is no doubt that Rodriguez&#8217;s return addresses an important hole in the rotation.</p>
<p>Rodriguez is regarded as one of the more promising young pitchers in baseball and has plenty of time to develop. A role in the middle of the Red Sox rotation this season will serve to curb the lofty expectations of Red Sox fans as the lefty continues to mature, but few question he has the raw talent of a future ace. The camaraderie in the clubhouse should help Rodriguez hone his craft as he learns from the savvy veterans during the playoff push, and fans can expect him to make a solid contribution as the Red Sox strive to stay atop the competitive AL East.</p>

Clay Buchholz got the start on the bump for the Sox and it was a rough one. Buchholz pitched five innings, let up seven hits, six earned runs, and three home runs. He is now 2-5 on the season with a 6.35 ERA.</p>
<p>Once again Buchholz disappoints us with an upsetting performance. The question that I keep asking is, <strong>WHY DOES FARRELL KEEP PITCHING HIM? </strong>Clay has done nothing that convinces me that he can be a starter in the rotation. He’s been a streaky pitcher his entire career and just isn’t reliable. I hate to admit it, but every time I see Clay on the mound, I have a good feeling were going to lose. I just don&#8217;t have any confidence in his ability to pitch anymore. There&#8217;s been many times when Clay has had great command and had a flare to his game but we haven&#8217;t seen that in years.</p>
<p>Buchholz was booed in Fenway Park last night. That never happens. Boston fans are notorious for sticking by their players through thick and thin. When our own fans boo one of our own, you know something is wrong. It just shows that after 10 years, I think Sox fans are done with Buchholz. I do find this sad however. Being booed by your own fans must be the worst feeling, just a big slap in the face. I hate when that happens because even though Buchholz is doing bad, it&#8217;s not like he&#8217;s trying to let off three home runs in one game. But at the end of the day it&#8217;s business and I&#8217;m right there with the frustration of the Sox fans.</p>
<p>Bottom line, I personally think Buchholz needs to go. He&#8217;s been with the team for a long time but it just doesn&#8217;t seem like its working out anymore. The Sox are looking like serious contenders this year. Their offense is showing that they have some of the best hitters in the entire MLB. But their pitching is the one thing that needs to step up if they want to compete deep into the playoffs. They cannot have anything holding them back so some changes need to be made before it&#8217;s too late.</p>

Boston got a reality check when it ran into a sputtering Kansas City team, posting only eleven runs over three games. Jackie Bradley Junior extended his hitting streak to 24 games with a solo home run during the second game of a day/night doubleheader, as the Red Sox took the final game of the series, 5-2, and were certainly thankful for a day off yesterday.</p>
<p>Moving forward throughout May, the Red Sox are at home against Cleveland and Colorado, before finishing the month on the road in Toronto and Baltimore.</p>
<p>Tonight, Clay Buchholz (2-3, 6.11), backed by an offense that can be downright superb at times, will take on the winners of four straight. The Indians are sitting at 2.5 games behind the White Sox for first place in the AL Central, and they need a solid series in Fenway to stay relevant. The Indians will send out Corey Kluber (2-5, 4.30), who gave up four earned runs in 5.1 innings the last time he faced Boston, on April 5th (Sox won, 6-2). The Red Sox and Indians split two games in Cleveland (as a third was rained out), after Buchholz gave up five earned runs in 4 innings the next night, on the sixth (Cleveland won, 7-6). These are two mediocre pitchers, both with high ERAs. Who will implode first? <strong>Final score: BOS 9, CLE 6</strong></p>

This is a team that is fun to watch on most nights, and if they stay healthy, will be able to challenge the Orioles throughout the summer for the AL East title. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Sox have scored 196 runs, backed by David Ortiz’s 9 home runs and 29 RBIs. This is good for the most runs scored in the league (the Cubs also have 196 runs scored). Pair that offensive support with a pitching staff that can typically keep their opponents under five runs (4.24 ERA average), and the Red Sox are suddenly eight games above .500. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Astros are coming to town, and they seem to be doing everything that the Red Sox are not. Houston sits in last place in the AL West at 14-21, and are just coming off of a 16 inning marathon victory against Cleveland. The Astros lack punch both offensively and defensively, and this is a series the Red Sox can easily take. However, the question remains: can the Red Sox sweep yet another team coming to Fenway Park?</span></p>

<p>The Sox will open the home stand with Clay Buchholz (1-3, 5.71) who will be going up against Sonny Gray (3-3, 4.84). Buchholz is coming off of his strongest start of the season, whereas Gray has lost two straight in poor outings. Depending on which Buchholz shows up, this game could easily go either way. Keep in mind this is a pitcher who inexplicably let up five earned runs to the hapless Atlanta Braves; and then six days later, held the powerhouse White Sox to three hits. <strong>Final score: BOS 6, OAK 4</strong></p>

Both teams have won eight of their last ten, and are both coming off of a much-needed day of rest.</p>
<p>The White Sox last week, split a four game series with Chicago, and the Red Sox completed a sweep of the New York Yankees in Boston. The last time the Red Sox swept the Yankees was in 2013-the year that they won the World Series.</p>
<p>Game 1 features knuckleballer Steven Wright (2-2, 1.37) against Jose Quintana (3-1, 1.47). The only thing more impressive than Quintana’s current ERA is Wright’s, at 1.37. Wright, with the possible exception of Porcello, is the most consistent pitcher the Red Sox have had this season. With more run support, Wright would be 4-0. However, he will go for his third win against a mediocre Chicago offense. This should be a low-scoring game that is won in a later inning. Final score: BOS 2, CWS 1</p>
<p>On May 4th, Clay Buchholz (0-3, 6.51) is going up against Carlos Rodon Danks (1-3, 4.33), who is moving up a day to take the place of John Danks, who was released. Buchholz has progressively looked shakier and less confident. His curveball seemed insignificant against an Atlanta Braves team that is destined to have the worst record in the league. What will become of Buchholz if he turns in yet another poor start? Final score: CWS 7, BOS 5</p>
<p>The final game of the series is seemingly a winnable game-for both teams. Henry Owens (0-0, 4.82) goes against Erik Johnson, who will be making his season debut. Owens is coming off of a game in which they both went at least six innings. Owens only gave up two earned runs against the suddenly panicking Yankees. Offense will be the deciding factor in this high scoring game, and if the Red Sox can get to the bullpen early, they might be able to run away with a win-and a series-in Chicago. Final score: BOS 8, CWS 6</p>
<p>One more reason to get excited for the Red Sox to take on the White Sox: As of right now, the Red Sox have a .5 game lead over the Orioles in the AL East. This is a small lead that could grow if the Red Sox perform. The Orioles, suddenly vulnerable, are taking on the Yankees in Baltimore.</p>

Rather, it really is worth asking when the Red Sox are going to finally part with John Farrell as their manager and allow Torey Lovullo to take over. It is a question of when, not if, because Farrell is clearly on his last legs as manager. In fact, the Red Sox likely would have relieved Farrell of his duties in the offseason were it not for some extenuating circumstances with his health. Lovullo had several chances to interview for managerial roles in the offseason, but he stayed as bench coach because the Red Sox convinced him that he was next in line to take over the dugout. But regardless of who the replacement is, it is time for Farrell to go; he is clearly in over his head and the Red Sox need leadership from a manager who can win.</p>
<p>It really has been stunning how Farrell&#8217;s in-game managing has fallen off of a cliff in 2016. Not that he was a very good in-game manager in the first place, but there have been multiple occasions in 2016 where Farrell has left literally everyone in the ballpark wondering what he is thinking.</p>
