The win in Cleveland was likely the Celtics biggest win of the season, especially being on the road and playing the Cavaliers after they had come off a loss. It looked ugly early for the Celts Friday in Cleveland but they were able to hang in and keep it close in the first two quarters before gaining the lead in the second half. A balanced attack with Isaiah Thomas, Avery Bradley, Evan Turner, Tyler Zeller and Jared Sullinger all scoring in double figures helped to hold off the Cavaliers late game push. The grittiest play of the game came with the Celtics down two points with seconds left. A missed free throw from Evan Turner allowed for Marcus Smart, 6&#8217;4&#8243;, boxing out Timofey Mozgov, 7&#8217;1&#8243; to cause a scramble for the rebound that ultimately went out off the Cavaliers. This afforded the Celtics just the chance they needed and, on a broken play, Bradley gathered himself to knock down the game winning triple from the corner.</p>
<p>Rolling into Sunday winners of three straight and coming off dethroning the mighty King the C&#8217;s hung 46 points on Sacramento in the first quarter en route to the win. They were in control wire to wire despite a pesky performance from the Kings who made runs but were never able to recover from the 76 point first half performance of the Celtics.</p>
<p>Boston is now in sole possession of third place in the Eastern Conference behind Cleveland and Toronto, they are winners of four in a row and nine of their last ten. Celtics&#8217;s fans have reason to be excited with the wins and the way the team has continued to get better and play together. However, four and half games is all that separates the now third place Celtics and the ninth place Hornets. The C&#8217;s will need to continue to win with a tough schedule ahead. Boston not only has a slew of balanced Eastern Conference teams to play that will all be jockeying for position but still has a variety of tough Western Conference opponents to face after the All-Star break including Golden State, Oklahoma City, Los Angeles Clippers (and Lakers), and Memphis to name a few, those wins will not come easy.</p>
<p>For now Boston will head to Milwaukee to go for five straight wins against the Bucks who are losers of five straight, before coming home to face Doc Rivers and his 34-17 Clippers that have won seven of their last ten, doing so without Blake Griffin.</p>
<p>The Celtics should feel confident heading to the Midwest behind their Eastern Conference player of the week Isaiah Thomas who continues to put up numbers and help the C&#8217;s win games. His most recent weekly stat line to earn said honors goes like this: 20.3 points, 7 assists, 4.5 rebounds, and 1.3 steals over 33.6 minutes per game. With the C&#8217;s seeming to play their best basketball of the season coach Brad Stevens will continue to keep their feet on the ground and their eyes on the clipboard to hopefully finish the next two games strong before heading into All-Star weekend.</p>

The Cavs stand alone atop the Eastern Conference at 35-13 while Boston has mustered a 29-22 record, good for a third place tie with Atlanta. The Celtics have been winning games by putting up points, scoring over 100 points in 13 of their last 14 games, that ties them for fifth best in the NBA with San Antonio. Defensive intensity has also been a mainstay with the C&#8217;s giving up 100.3 points per game, not too shabby, and good for ninth best in the NBA, just behind Indiana and ahead of the Clippers.</p>
<p>Led by All-Star point guard Isaiah Thomas there is no doubt that the Celtics are on the rise and coming down the stretch run will hope to continue this push for home court advantage in the first round of the playoffs. It should be noted however that the competition that Boston has recently played is not near what they will face Friday night. The Celtics have essentially taken care of business and won games they are supposed to win to be considered a contender in Eastern Conference. The most notable recent victories have come over the Pistons, Pacers and Bulls who, if the regular season ended today, would be in the playoffs.</p>
<p>Cleveland on the other hand is in a different class than recent Celtics competitors. They are 7-3 in their last 10 games and have had marquee wins over San Antonio and the Clippers. Changes for Cleveland since they beat the Celtics 89-77 in December include the presence of Kyrie Irving who did not play as he was still rehabilitating a fractured knee cap and Cavs new head coach, ex-Celtics assistant coach Tyronn Lue, after the surprise firing of David Blatt.</p>
<p>Its likely going to be a difficult environment for the Celtics playing in Cleveland in front of a Friday night packed house. Not to mention LeBron James and the Cavs will be looking to rebound from a loss to the Hornets in a game where they did not face their opponents leading scorer Kemba Walker. Instead they were torched by Jeremy Lin, that&#8217;s right Jeremy Lin who hung 24 points and eight dimes on Cleveland, sending them too defeat. Expect a fired up crowd and a Cavaliers team trying to fend off a second straight loss as the Celtics try to keep their string of winning ways alive at Quicken Loans Arena.</p>
<p>Key match ups to watch will be Isaiah Thomas, who is coming into the game scoring 21.4 points per game to go with 6.6 assists, and Kyrie Irving who is averaging 17.2 points per contest. However it is somewhat unlikely they will actually defend one another all the time as Brad Stevens will rotate Marcus Smart and Avery Bradley onto Irving to stifle his attack with their tenacious on ball defense. Another match up to watch will be Jae Crowder doing his best to slow down the LeBron James freight train and the carousel of Celtics bigs trying to rebound with Kevin Love, Timofey Mozgov and Tristan Thompson.</p>
<p>If the Celtics are able to score over 100 points, as they have been consistently doing, and are able to keep the Cavs off the offensive glass for easy put backs, they will have a shot of dethroning the King and his Cavs in their own castle. On the other hand, if the Celtics are forced to grind out a poor shooting performance like the game back in December they will surely struggle against the defending Eastern Conference Champs.</p>
<p>Its a potential playoff preview of two teams heading in the right direction, the Cavs under the new direction of Tyronn Lue, and the red hot C&#8217;s playing their best basketball under Brad Stevens. The Q Arena should be rocking on Friday night and Celtics fans will be able to see how this improved Boston team measures up against the likely number one seed in the east!</p>

Boston is 3-2 in their last five games with wins over Charlotte, Chicago and New Orleans, however, it may be their recent losses that are the most telling. Boston has played the two best teams in the NBA, San Antonio last week and Golden State on Friday night. Both games ended with one more in the loss column but the young Celtics team showed a lot of character and poise despite defeat. In San Antonio the Celtics looked to be out of it in the fourth quarter before a late rally to close the gap that came up short and had them lose by three as the Spurs remained undefeated at home. The Celtics bounced back to beat the Pelicans on the road and then the Bulls at home before facing the Warriors at the Garden. As expected Boston played Golden State tough, fighting them tooth and nail to force not one but two overtimes.</p>
<p>One thing that can be said about the Celtics Friday night is they took every punch from the Warriors and kept on coming. Every time they got knocked to the mat by a great play or a Steph Curry three, of which he made six, they got back up, tried to have a good possession and continued to fight. It seemed as though they truly believed they were supposed to be playing with the Warriors, it didn&#8217;t matter if no one else had beat them, they had come to Boston to lose. Ultimately Golden State did what they had done to everyone else, maintained perfection and ripped the heart out of Celtics fans with a double overtime win that felt more like a steal after all that had happened between the fourth quarter and overtime. There is, however, no doubt that the C&#8217;s had chances to win the game in regulation and OT but were just unable to capitalize.</p>
<p>In the end of regulation Isaiah Thomas had a chance to win it with a couple tics on the clock but couldn&#8217;t connect as he was well defended by the long Shaun Livingston. Brad Stevens then drew up a great inbound play for the hot-handed Kelly Olynyk to screen then pop for the potential game winning jumper, unfortunately it was a bit rushed with 0.7 seconds on the clock and with that miss on to overtime they went. In the first overtime Thomas had a better look with a floater to win it that didn&#8217;t fall and in the second OT with the Celtics down by three Jae Crowder had a chance to tie it up but was also unable to hit the shot. Ultimately the looks were there, the Celtics were just unable to knock them down.</p>
<p>Although Boston did not pull out the victory they do know they can hang with the best two teams in the NBA and give them all they want. The next step for Brad Stevens&#8217; team is to figure out how to finish those games and get the big victories. Lets face facts that a loss is never a good thing but with a team that appears to be gelling they have the opportunity to build from these losses. If anything, Boston can be confident now that they can play with anybody in the NBA, the key is the finish.</p>
<p>It appears the balanced attack is a solid approach but one does have to wonder without a go-to player is the pressure now going to be on Isaiah Thomas to take and make these shots? Is it his job to put the harpoon in and finish opponents? For better or worse the days of Paul Pierce are over, but when he was in Boston you could almost guarantee it was going to be The Captain and The Truth putting it up from the elbow or going to the rack to try and draw a foul during the final seconds of any close game.</p>
<p>Either way Boston is playing solid team basketball and should enter the matchup against LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers Tuesday night with a great deal of confidence. The matchup will be a home game for the Celtics who currently sit at 14-10 in seventh place in a tight early race in the Eastern Conference. The Cavs enter the game at 15-7, good enough for first place in the east, (they would be fourth in the Western Conference behind Golden State, San Antonio and Oklahoma City). The Cavs have stumbled a bit of late going 2-3 in their last five games with wins over Orlando and Portland but loses to Washington, Miami and New Orleans. Cleveland recently got shooting guard/wing Iman Shumpert back from an sprained wrist however still do not have All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving in the line up who is expected to potentially make his season debut next week.</p>
<p>Another great feature to this game is that there is no love loss between these two teams. Boston is a young team gunning, albeit from a distance for now, for the Cleveland crown. The C&#8217;s have played them tough despite getting swept out of the playoffs in the first round last year on Cleveland&#8217;s way to the NBA Finals. The Cavs left the City of Boston bruised, battered and down one star player after Kelly Olynyk dislocated Kevin Love&#8217;s shoulder and ended his season as well as diminished their chances for an NBA title. Jae Crowder suffered an injury of his own at the (back)hand of J.R. Smith in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference playoff series last year. Crowder suffered a vicious blow that landed him on the ground with a sprained ACL requiring rehab as the league slapped Smith with a suspension. Both teams play physical and both teams play defense, there is a good chance bodies will hit the deck tomorrow night in Boston as these teams are hungry for a win. The Cavs will be trying to maintain first place and the Celtics trying to prove they are a legitimate contender in east.</p>
<p>LeBron James, who might be one of the most physical players, and is likely one of the most physically impressive specimens the league has ever seen, is entering the game scoring 26.4 points per contest to go along with 7.7 rebounds and 6.4 assists. The superstar floor general is also getting All-Star production out of Kevin Love who is scoring a shade under 18 points per game and ripping down 11.0 rebounds a night. The supporting cast of Mo Williams filling in for the injured Kyrie Irving as well as J.R. Smith are both averaging in double figures.</p>
<p>The Celtics will need to match the Cavs physicality, trying to keep the LeBron James locomotive out of the lane and off the fast break to avoid easy buckets at the rim, free throws and foul trouble. Another apparent force is the big Russian, no not Ivan Drago, the center Timofey Mozgov. Despite his limited action he is able to score at the rim, rebound and block shots and may see a lot of time if the Celtics try to play a smaller line up with more skilled big men. Boston will need to look for Jared Sullinger to be a beast on the boards and the rest of the rotation of bigs to do their part in the trenches boxing out to avoid easy second chance points. The Celtics don&#8217;t have to be perfect to beat the Cavs but they need to play smart, grind it out on defense and get good looks on offense as points may be at a premium in this one. Boston is led in scoring by Isaiah Thomas averaging 20.8 points per game and Avery Bradley pouring in 16.3 a night and continue with a deep and balanced team having seven players averaging 9.0 or greater points per game.</p>
<p>Celtics fans have a lot to be excited about as a confident C&#8217;s team welcomes the Eastern Conference establishment, Cleveland Cavaliers, to what will be a jam-packed Garden heavily supporting this never-say-die Celtics team. Although early in the season this one will have the feel of a potential future playoff series.</p>

<p>As painful as it was to be forced to recall that deeply suppressed memory, it made me somewhat giddy. Was I about to see Lebron go full supernova to save the Cleveland Cavaliers season and force a Game 7? Without having it come at the expense of my own team? Was anything even out of the realm of possibility?</p>
<p>When the final horn sounded, Lebron&#8217;s stat line didn&#8217;t disappoint: 36 points, 15 rebounds, 9 assists, just shy of his third triple double of the Finals. But somehow his performance still was disappointing, as the Golden State Warriors withheld a furious JR Smith heat check 3-point barrage in the final minutes to end the franchise&#8217;s 40 year title drought.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/06/17/lebron-falls-short-as-warriors-end-40-year-nba-title-drought/">Lebron Falls Short as Warriors End 40 Year NBA Title Drought</a> (618 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cavaliers general manager Daniel Griffin announced Tuesday that it&#8217;s highly unlikely that Kevin Love will return to play for the Cavs in the playoffs. </p>
<p>This is of course after Celtics center Kelly Olynyk pulled Love&#8217;s arm out of its socket during Game 4 on Sunday. After the game, Love called Olynyk&#8217;s play intentional and bush league, and there were reports that the injury may affect Love&#8217;s interest in signing a free agent deal with the Celtics in the offseason. </p>

The Green currently sit in seventh place in the East with four games to go, by virtue of holding the tiebreaker over Brooklyn. Their magic number to clinch a playoff spot is four (any combination of Boston wins and Indiana/Miami losses). There is still a small chance that the Celtics could get up as high as the six seed, but will most likely finish as either seventh or eighth in the Eastern Conference. Therefore that leaves three teams as possible first round playoff opponents: Atlanta, Cleveland or Toronto.</p>
<p><strong>Possible Match-Up: #1 Atlanta Hawks vs #8 Boston Celtics</strong></p>
<p>Role reversal from the 2008 playoffs! Back then the Celtics had the number one seed and the Hawks had just clawed and scratched their way into the playoffs with a 37-45 record (a possible record for this year&#8217;s Celtics), and guess what? The Hawks were able to push the eventual champion Celtics all the way to seven games in an exciting first round. Now, I&#8217;m not saying that just because the tables are turned that Boston could do that this year. That series in 2008 was a bit of an odd one with the Celtics unable to perform on the road in the playoffs. Every game in Boston was completely one sided where the games in Atlanta were close match-ups that the soon-to-be champs just couldn&#8217;t close out. The Celtics are 1-2 against the Hawks this year, but if they met in the playoffs it would be a completely different Celtics team.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/04/10/who-would-you-rather-see-the-celtics-play-in-the-playoffs/">Who Would You Rather See the Celtics Play in the Playoffs?</a> (1,381 words)</p>

The Celts are also only a 0.5 game behind the seventh seeded Brooklyn Nets, and are three games behind the sixth seeded Milwaukee Bucks. When the dust settles, I believe the C’s are going to find themselves in the NBA Playoffs. The question is do they pose a threat to upset one of the upper echelon teams in the east?</p>
<p>I am not going to be a Celtics pessimist, but the answer to that question is no. Boston will most likely be the seventh or eighth seed if they are a part of the playoff picture, and that means they will be matched up against the Atlanta Hawks or Cleveland Cavaliers. As it stands now, most experts pick the Cavs to represent the Eastern Conference in the NBA Finals, despite Atlanta being 7.5 games ahead of Cleveland in the standings. I think whether the Celts are matched up against the Hawks or Cavs, the C’s will be eliminated in five or six games. I now do think it is more beneficial for Boston to make the playoffs rather than be back in the lottery.

But even after the Phoenix Suns offloaded their malcontent point guard, somehow, some way, Ainge managed to convince his former assistant and current Suns GM Ryan McDonough to part with a second of his three-headed point guard monster, Isaiah Thomas, just before the clock turned 3pm EST.</p>
<p>In exchange, the Celtics surrendered Marcus Thornton and the 2016 first round pick acquired from the Cleveland Cavaliers. Not bad, Danny. Not bad.</p>
