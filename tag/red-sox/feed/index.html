After a dismal road-trip, the Red Sox failed to improve on their record in a series against the Yankees, and now sit at only nine games above .500.</p>
<p>The playoff picture in the East is tight as it will ever be, with the Sox three games behind the Jays, and 2.5 behind the Orioles. At the moment, the Red Sox hold a .5 game lead over the Tigers for the second spot in the race for the second wild card berth. A poor series against a .500 team was the last thing David Ortiz and Co. needed, but regardless, it is what they got.</p>
<p>With a team as streaky as this, it&#8217;s feasible to consider the possibility that they might go on another tear, and finish the season with breathing room in any playoff race. However, sports in the Boston media remain ever-reactionary, and the flavor of the past ten games has been doom. It is always difficult to remain positive, after the stretch the Sox have most recently suffered through.</p>
<p>One of the bright spots on the team has been newcomer Andrew Benintendi. Unfortunately, the key word in the sentence prior is &#8220;newcomer&#8221;. All rookies are bound to make mistakes, or have a &#8220;welcome to the League&#8221; moment. Benintendi&#8217;s simply came during a crucial moment in the game.</p>
<p>For those watching, it was next to unbelievable. A seemingly playable, albeit sharply, hit ball by Jacoby Ellsbury quickly made it&#8217;s way into left field, prompting a quick response by Benintendi. The ball went mere centimeters over the 22 year old, and Ellsbury was safely aboard with a double, driving in two. Those two runs proved insurmountable in the eighth and the ninth for the Sox, who once again left the field with a heartbreaking loss.</p>
<p>Heartbreaking losses are acceptable in a season of 162 games, but at the rate they are coming lately to this team, one has to wonder if this is truly a team built for postseason success. All outside factors point to yes, with phenoms X, Betts, JBJ, and now Benintendi-but close games, especially during the postseason-are must-wins.</p>

Photo: Joe Nicholson, USA Today Sports" ></a><p>If anyone from New England stayed up till one in the morning to watch the Red Sox lose six out of eleven games on the West Coast, then&#8230;sorry. However, you were not alone, and you were also not alone if you felt frustration and anxiety as the Sox quietly ducked out of a playoff spot for the first time since April.</p>
<p>Now that all is said and done, the Red Sox sit three games out of first place in the AL East and a half game behind the Deroit Tigers for the second wild-card spot.</p>
<p>Opposite-coast games are tough for any team, but when you pair the exhaustion of eleven games in eleven nights-after a six hour flight from Boston, in which three different ballparks were visited-and, incredibly, the fact that the Sox have had to endure 43 games in 44 days-their toil is understandable.</p>
<p>The one off-day the Red Sox get in the midst of their mind-bending stretch comes today-and they get to relax on yet another long flight, this time back to Boston to take on the Yankees the next night. The six-game homestand is much needed, as the Sox will soon be on the road again for another 11 games, in four cities.</p>
<p>A few months ago, the entire city of Boston seemed confident in the Red Sox and their playoff chances. Now, with a little less than two months to go, hope is dwindling. If the Red Sox can manage to take four or five of six from the Yankees and Dbacks-a highly achievable goal, temperaments will improve, but the outlook after their next eleven game set on the road remains to be seen.</p>
<p>A few more thoughts&#8230;1. Why can David Price not get to ten wins? Who pitches for the Sox in a one-game playoff? 2. A-Rod finally stepping away from the diamond. One more series at Fenway? 3. ESPN can&#8217;t help but make sure that JBJ is always in the headlines as a trade candidate in the offseason. 4. Benintendi worth the wait so far.</p>

<p>The blast was number 526 for David, who was recently placed at number 78 on ESPN&#8217;s list of greatest baseball players of all time.</p>
<p>Consider last night just another day in the office in this man&#8217;s fabled baseball career. He owns this city, just as Tom Brady owns the NFL. So, does Dave Dombrowski have a case to bring back Big Papi for 2017? A few months ago, the answer would undoubtedly have been no, but with the second half of the season well underway, there has been some indecisiveness. Nothing definitive has been said regarding one more year for the 40 year old, but there is an air of hope for the Fenway faithful.</p>

Coming out of the break, Sox fans (including myself) were hopeful that David Price had figured out the source of his struggles throughout the first half of the year. Unfortunately, it was much of the same for Price and the Sox last night in the Bronx.</p>
<p>Like so many times this season, the big lefty looked sharp in the opening frames. His velocity was excellent, painting the black with a fastball touching 96 mph early and often. That, combined with his ability to mix in his breaking ball saw Price making quick work of the Yankees 19th ranked lineup through the first three innings. But, much like it has SO many times this season, one big inning ultimately did in the Red Sox &#8220;ace&#8221;.</p>
<p>So often this year, Price&#8217;s nemesis has been the long ball. While he didn&#8217;t allow a yabo last night, (a small miracle) he did surrender five hits in the fourth inning that resulted in three Yankee runs. Combine that with an excellent performance from Tanaka and the great Yankee bullpen, and that was all she wrote for the Sox and their six game winning streak.</p>
<p>Watching a pitcher with Price&#8217;s track record and ability struggle so mightily this season has been nothing short of perplexing. Mowing down lineups for years with the Rays, Jays, and Tigers, no one could have envisioned him sitting on an ERA of 4.36 twenty starts into his Red Sox career. Here&#8217;s hoping he can right the ship before the Sox and their playoff hopes disappear in the heat of the summer.</p>

Leon Halip (Getty Images)" ></a><p>Six Red Sox players were recently named to the All-Star team, with Dustin Pedroia currently on the outside looking in. Starting for the Red Sox in San Diego will be David Ortiz (DH), Xander Bogaerts (SS), Mookie Betts (OF), and Jackie Bradley Jr. (OF). Pitchers selected from the Red Sox include Steven Wright and Craig Kimbrel.</p>
<p>Five of the aforementioned names should have almost been shoo-ins. Ortiz, at 40, is hitting at an unbelievable rate. Bogaerts is clearly the best shortstop in the AL. Betts and Bradley Jr. have been impeccable in the outfield, and both are exceeding all expectations at the plate. Steven Wright&#8217;s ERA is 2.68, second in the AL.</p>
<p>But then there is one more name: Craig Kimbrel, who was acquired by the Red Sox for four prospects in the offseason. San Diego rightly touted him as the best closer in baseball, and at that point in time, it certainly seemed he was. When Boston brought him in, he was portrayed as a bullpen stabilizer and lock-down pitcher in the media.</p>
<p>When Kimbrel is called upon, who shows up on the mound might be based upon the score. From Scott Lauber (ESPN): &#8220;In save situations this season, Kimbrel has allowed nine hits and three walks in 18 2/3 innings, with 27 strikeouts and a 1.45 ERA. But in non-save situations, he has allowed 12 hits and 10 walks in 13 1/3 innings, with 21 strikeouts and a 6.75 ERA&#8221;.</p>
<p>These stats never shined brighter when Kimbrel faced the Rangers this week with a 3-2 Red Sox deficit. Kimbrel got zero outs, and gave up four runs, turning a potentially winnable game into an unwinnable one for the Red Sox, who are in dire need of wins.</p>
<p>So, is Kimbrel All-Star worthy? Is he worth the four prospects? Maybe. Some would argue that his 17 saves in 19 opportunities is respectable enough for a nod. But not many.</p>

Photo: Michael Dwyer (AP)" ></a><p>Back in 2014, when the Red Sox signed Cuban native Rusney Castillo to a 7-year, $72.5 million contract, it finally felt like Boston had won something. 2014 was a year many Sox fans would like to forget, but Castillo was something of a bright spot. Castillo joined the big leagues late in the season, played in 10 games, bashed three home runs, and gave the Red Sox faithful something to dream about in 2015.</p>
<p>When Castillo finally got to play on a more regular basis, the general consensus was that perhaps the outfielder probably needed more time to acclimate to the league. Major League Baseball is a far cry from Triple-A ball, and with a .253 average, he was sent back down to Pawtucket for a little more seasoning. This season, after losing steam in the minors, Rusney continued to disappoint on the Pawsox, batting .245. This major, almost startling, lack of prowess, finally caused the Red Sox to place the outfielder-whom some predicted would be a top 40 player this year-on outright waivers.</p>
<p>It is at this point extremely unlikely that any team would pick up Castillo, due to his hefty contract and lack of serious production.</p>

In a match-up with one of the very best in the game in Madison Bumgarner, Price was as sharp as he&#8217;s been all season long, spotting his fastball and making quick work of an opportunistic Giant&#8217;s lineup. The only problem? The Red Sox offense, who has carried Price through his lackluster start of the season with tremendous run support, forgot to show up.</p>
<p>John Farrel has to take the lion&#8217;s share of the blame, as he made what I believed to be a huge blunder in the final inning. With men on first and second and just one out, the struggling Travis Shaw was due up to bat. Shaw has looked absolutely lost at the plate as of late, and Farrel should have pinch hit Rutledge or Hernandez for Shaw in this spot. Instead, Farrell elected to take the bat out of the hands of the hottest hitter on the team in Chris Young, and Shaw struck out on a breaking ball in the dirt.</p>
<p>Let me be clear- I am not among the contingency who believe that the Sox are winning despite John Farrell. I think he&#8217;s done a fine job this season, and he&#8217;s earned the right to be at the helm through the playoff push. But some of his in-game decisions this year have been baffling to say the least, and it&#8217;s going to catch up with him at some point or another.</p>
<p>While the loss was certainly frustrating, my big takeaway was the performance of the man brought in to be the ace of this staff.  Price looked like the confident, controlled pitcher we all remember from his days of mowing down lineups in Tampa and Detroit, and he outlasted one of the baseball&#8217;s elite in Bumgarner last night. He got stronger as the game went on, with his fastball touching 95 as late as the 7th and 8th ininngs. Once again, Price was once again done-in by the long ball, which has been the crux of his struggles all season long.</p>
<p>So yeah, the Sox split the mini-series with the Giants, but this series may ultimately be remembered as the moment when David Price found &#8220;it&#8221; for the first time in a Red Sox uniform. Despite their potent lineup, the Sox won&#8217;t be a true contender without a dominant Price come October.</p>

This is surprising, since the sheer amount of firepower displayed by the Red Sox may have led one to believe that they put up 15 runs per game.</p>
<p>Bogaerts did run his hit streak to 26 games, and the Red Sox did win the first two games to walk away with a split, but there is an air of disappointment after they dropped the final two games. The pitching staff gave up 25 runs over the final 18 innings, which is no recipe for success. Joe Kelly was largely to blame, giving up 7 ERs in 2.1 innings, but Porcello did nothing to assuage the bleeding, giving up 5 ERs in 6 full and allowing three long home runs.</p>
<p>The Red Sox will remain up a game on the Orioles in the AL East, as they look to widen the gap over the Toronto Blue Jays, who are suddenly only 3.5 games behind.</p>
<p>Tonight, David Price (7-1, 5.11) will look to get the Red Sox back to their winning ways. Price faced Toronto on May 29th and pitched well, giving the Red Sox enough support to propel them to a 5-3 victory. He will face his former team for a third time at 7:10 in Boston, and will be facing R.A. Dickey (2-6, 4.64) who cannot beat the Red Sox. In three starts against them, Dickey has led the Blue Jays to a loss each time. Price&#8217;s 94 mph fastball should be able to take down Dickey once more. Expect the knuckleball to be close to ineffective. <strong>Final score: BOS 8, TOR 3</strong></p>

Neither happened, and yet, the Red Sox offense still managed to score twenty runs in a series in which they took two out of three from the Colorado Rockies.</p>
<p>At 11 games over the .500 mark, Boston can look forward to a 7 game road trip beginning in Toronto for three games, and ending in an extremely important four game showdown against second-place Baltimore. With first place in mind, this is a vital road trip to establish a cushion in the AL East.</p>
<p>Joe Kelly (2-0, 5.28), who shocked a lot of people in his last start (Kelly took a no-hitter into the sixth inning against Cleveland in his first start back from rehab) looks to bump his record to 3-0, after slicing his ERA almost in half last week. Kelly had previously been impressing in Triple-A Pawtucket, but not many could have predicted how in command he would look on the mound. Opposing Kelly, for Toronto, is Aaron Sanchez (4-1, 3.20), who most recently went seven innings in a 9-3 Blue Jays drubbing of the Twins. Sanchez can be expected to go for around six innings, but the Boston bats have silenced more impressive pitchers this season. <strong>Final score: BOS 6, TOR 4</strong></p>

Boston got a reality check when it ran into a sputtering Kansas City team, posting only eleven runs over three games. Jackie Bradley Junior extended his hitting streak to 24 games with a solo home run during the second game of a day/night doubleheader, as the Red Sox took the final game of the series, 5-2, and were certainly thankful for a day off yesterday.</p>
<p>Moving forward throughout May, the Red Sox are at home against Cleveland and Colorado, before finishing the month on the road in Toronto and Baltimore.</p>
<p>Tonight, Clay Buchholz (2-3, 6.11), backed by an offense that can be downright superb at times, will take on the winners of four straight. The Indians are sitting at 2.5 games behind the White Sox for first place in the AL Central, and they need a solid series in Fenway to stay relevant. The Indians will send out Corey Kluber (2-5, 4.30), who gave up four earned runs in 5.1 innings the last time he faced Boston, on April 5th (Sox won, 6-2). The Red Sox and Indians split two games in Cleveland (as a third was rained out), after Buchholz gave up five earned runs in 4 innings the next night, on the sixth (Cleveland won, 7-6). These are two mediocre pitchers, both with high ERAs. Who will implode first? <strong>Final score: BOS 9, CLE 6</strong></p>
