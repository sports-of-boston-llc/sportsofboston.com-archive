Adding Jackson to the 53-man roster put the Patriots at a total of 75 different players making up the 53-man roster over the course of this season. The injuries have been noticeable and if this were any other team they would have been crippled. Instead Bill Belichick and Tom Brady have steered the ship to another first round playoff bye and with another win can lock up home field advantage throughout the playoffs. Injuries are part of the game but it&#8217;s obvious that no one handles them better than the New England Patriots.</p>
<p>&#8211; Joey Iosefa is the exact reason Patriots fans only wonder one thing every year which is &#8220;are they going to have the first or second seed?&#8221; LeGarrette Blount was finally getting the late season production that he has been so good at. Just as he&#8217;s getting the carries he goes down for the year with a hip injury. The expectation was James White and Brandon Bolden would see an increased role, which they both did. In classic Belichick fashion he promoted Iosefa from he practice squad on Saturday night. Iosefa then carried the ball 14 times for 51 hard earned yards, while also blocking as a full back. Sure it wasn&#8217;t a Jonas Gray 200-yard game but Belichick once again found production where you&#8217;d least expect it. The addition of Steven Jackson adds depth and experience, not to mention he has fresh legs. For how the Patriots use the running game they definitely have the pieces in place for a postseason push.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/12/21/notes-and-observations-week-15-patriots-clinch-1st-round-bye-handling-the-titans-33-16/">Notes and Observations Week 15: Patriots Clinch 1st Round Bye Handling the Titans 33-16</a> (1,430 words)</p>

With Dion Lewis and LaGarrette Blount out with season ending injuries the once dynamic combo of speed and power has been replaced by special team players and practice squad promotions. Jackson will add depth, experience, power running, ball security, and, for the Patriots, will hopefully transition to the offensive system quickly having played under offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels in 2011 in St. Louis.</p>
<p>With all the injuries the Pats have suffered Brandon Bolden, a key player in the special teams game who has always taken limited snaps at running back, has become the featured back in the New England offensive. He has been accompanied by the speedy James White who is able to play a vital role in the passing game. However with only two backs on the active roster New England was forced to promote a practice squad player for Sunday&#8217;s game against the Titans. Joey Iosefa, a 247-pound fullback who had been cut by Tampa Bay and later picked up by New England, made an impact with 51 yards on 14 carries and one big run in which he bulldozed Tennessee cornerback Coty Sensabaugh.</p>
<p>With New England so thin in the backfield, and with the playoffs and cold weather ahead, signing a veteran back like Steven Jackson looks like a solid move, although Jackson hasn&#8217;t played since being released by Atlanta in February. When in a Falcons uniform last season he averaged 3.7 yards per carry in 15 games. The three time Pro Bowler has churned out 11,388 yards over the course of 11 seasons in the NFL playing for Atlanta and St. Louis before that. Now at 32 years old the Patriots hope he has a little left in the tank to propel their running game forward. At 12-2 New England has secured a first round bye and has a great shot at the number one overall seed in the AFC. Over the next few weeks McDaniels and running back coaches will have the opportunity to work with Jackson and integrate him into the current carousel of backs.</p>
<p>If Jackson is able to get on the field quickly this would mean Bolden could get back to his special teams duties with limited touches at running back if needed. It would seem that the apparently explosive James White isn&#8217;t going anywhere as he has become a integral part of the Patriots offensive attack, particularly on passing downs. His combination of pass catching and ability to make plays when getting the ball in space gives back a little of the Dion Lewis dimension to the offensive.</p>
<p>The Patriots also recently signed running back Montee Ball to the practice squad, the Denver Broncos 2013 second round draft pick. Ball was productive in his rookie season with 120 carries for 559 yards and four touchdowns. In 2014 a groin injury sidelined him for much of the season before he was ultimately released.</p>
<p>If Jackson can get on the field this Sunday he will face a defense that is second in the NFL against the run for a better-than-expected Jets team currently fighting for a wild card spot.</p>

Offensively the team is still banged up but the return of Rob Gronkowski made an immediate impact. Julian Edelman returned to the practice field much earlier than anyone expected, granted it was light work but still a positive sight nonetheless. Both of those only added to the fact that the Bengals lost the game and Andy Dalton for potentially the rest of the season and the Broncos blew a 12-0 lead at home against the Raiders. The Patriots took the opening and now control their own destiny.</p>
<p>&#8211; Sunday night was the most balanced offensive game plan that they&#8217;ve used all year. Tom Brady finished with 30 pass attempts while the team as a whole ran the ball 31 times. They finally decided to stick with the run and it paid dividends. LeGarrette Blount looked to be having his most productive game of the season rushing 10 times for 53 yards. Unfortunately his day and season were ended early. Brandon Bolden showed a good burst for his first extended look of the season finishing with 51 yards on 16 carries. James White started to make more of an impact in the passing game gaining 27 yards on a screen pass. It&#8217;s a shame that one of the best rushing games for the year is marred by the loss of Blount.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/12/16/notes-and-observations-week-14-patriots-take-control-of-the-afc-defeat-texans-27-6/">Notes and Observations Week 14: Patriots Take Control of The AFC, Defeat Texans 27-6</a> (1,046 words)</p>

The Patriots ultimately defeated the Giants 27-26 on a last second, 54-yard field goal off the foot of Stephen Gostkowski. Tom Brady led the Pats into range by completing a 4th and 10 pass on their way down the field to victory.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Pats lost wide receiver Julian Edelman in the first half when it appeared he was rolled up on by Giants Linebacker Jasper Brinkley. Edelman limped off under his own power but tossed his helmet down when getting to the sidelines indicating that the injury may be more than just a tweaked ankle. He did not return to the game and afterwards was diagnosed with a broken foot, specifically a fracture of the fifth metatarsal bone in the mid-foot commonly known as the Jones fracture.</p>
<p>Fans may remember earlier this year when Dez Bryant suffered a similar injury, it does require surgery which Edelman underwent on Monday. Bryant was able to come back five weeks after going under the knife. Another Pro Bowl receiver, Julio Jones had the same injury and it took him a bit longer to recover. Like most foot problems if not given the proper time to heal they can lead to continued pain and possibly even recurrent fracture, but if anyone is likely to press getting back on the field it would be Julian Edelman. Not only is Edelman as tough as a bag of hammers, repeatedly taking big shots going over the middle and as a return man, but he is also a fierce competitor who wears his emotions on his sleeve.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/11/16/julian-edelman-breaks-foot-return-this-season-questionable/">Julian Edelman Breaks Foot, Return This Season Questionable</a> (394 words)</p>

(AP Photo/Steven Senne)" ></a><p>Last week I talked about how spoiled we are in New England basically being able to pencil the Patriots into the AFC Championship every year. This week was another prime example of just how good we have it here. The Patriots handled the Redskins all game and the win was never in doubt. Tom Brady finished just one yard shy of 300 for the day and threw for two more touchdowns. The defense played as good as they have been the past few weeks. Even with all that it was a bad game by Patriots&#8217; standards.</p>
<p>&#8211; Tom Brady put up another solid performance with 299 yards, going 26-39 with two touchdowns. He had a very uncharacteristic interception that made me do a double take to make sure it was Brady throwing the ball. It was a rare instance where he didn&#8217;t read the defense correctly and just never saw linebacker Keenan Robinson playing zone. Credit to Robinson for reading the play and making the interception, but that was a bad pass by Brady. Again, that&#8217;s how great it is to be a Patriots fan. These awful plays are so few and far between that it&#8217;s actually shocking when it happens.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/11/11/notes-and-observations-week-9-patriots-beat-redskins-27-10-to-go-8-0-for-2nd-time-in-team-history/">Notes and Observations, Week 9: Patriots Beat Redskins 27-10 to go 8-0 for 2nd Time in Team History</a> (929 words)</p>

The game concludes a week that included two days of joint practices. Tom Brady and the Patriots offense shined throughout the two sessions that both teams called valuable. As with the first preseason contest, tonight will feature limited time by the starters with backups playing most of the game. With that in mind, here are five players to watch tonight:</p>
<p><b>Chris Harper- </b>The rookie wide receiver out of Cal will likely get a lot of chances tonight with Julian Edelman, Brian Tyms, and Aaron Dobson all dealing with injuries. He has looked solid in camp and has come on strong as of late and was productive in joint practices while working with Jimmy Garoppolo. The 5&#8217;11&#8221;, 175 pound Harper has also had some punt return opportunities in camp.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon Bolden/ James White- </strong>Bolden and White have been battling throughout camp to fill the third down back roll that was left open by the departure of Shane Vereen. Bolden is stronger, but White has more speed and quickness. White played in last Thursday&#8217;s preseason opener and looked like a player ready to take on the third down role. Bolden has the advantage that he plays on special teams, but if White has another strong outing he could put himself firmly ahead of Bolden.</p>
<p><strong>Malcom Brown- </strong>The rookie first round pick is one of several options to fill the middle of the defensive line after Vince Wilfork signed with Houston this offseason. Pairing Brown with 2014 first round pick Dominque Easley is something the Patriots hope to do for the next several seasons.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Garoppolo- </strong>The potential of Garoppolo starting at least one game this regular season has been well documented. What the Patriots need is for Garoppolo to have a strong game and continue to build toward his possible regular season action. He looked shaky in the first half against Green Bay last week but improved as the game went on. A more consistent performance will help both the Patriots and the young quarterback going forward.</p>

In fact, neither side got off to an appreciable start offensively, trading three-and-outs to start and finding difficulties for a good chunk of the 1st quarter. Tom Brady did get a first down on a quarterback sneak and marched effectively and quickly down the field, but two sacks later on the drive damaged New England&#8217;s hopes there. By the time the first frame had concluded, the two sides had combined for 60 yards of offense and four first downs.</p>
<p>Danny Amendola returned a punt 39 yards to start the second quarter, and it didn&#8217;t take New England long to capitalize on the great field position. Six plays later, Brady found Rob Gronkowski on the left side of the end zone, as Gronk twisted his whole body around while lunging for the catch.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2014/12/21/patriots-survive-gritty-challenge-from-jets/">Patriots Survive Gritty Challenge From Jets</a> (645 words)</p>

Both the Patriots and Chargers needed the victory but each had their own reasons. The Patriots needed the win to keep pace in the AFC and hold onto the number one seed. The Chargers, on the other hand, needed the win to keep their playoff hopes alive against the competitive AFC field. With the offense not exactly looking sharp, the defense rose to the occasion on the road. Strong play all around defensively kept the Patriots in it long enough for Tom Brady and the offense to finally put it together. The end result was a bounce back win on the road, against a tough, playoff-caliber team.</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8220;Next man up,&#8221; has always been the Patriots philosophy, but no more so than the last two seasons. We all remember how decimated the team was with injuries last season, only to still make it to the AFC championship game. This year, they again lost Jerod Mayo for the season, and Sunday night saw Dont&#8217;a Hightower on the inactive list. Hightower had stepped up in a major way becoming the signal caller on the defense in Mayo&#8217;s absence. He along side Jamie Collins had successfully held down the linebacker positions. Without Hightower, a drop off in production could have been expected. Instead Jamie Collins played his best game as a pro.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2014/12/09/notes-and-observations-week-14-patriots-grind-out-a-tough-23-14-win-over-chargers/">Notes and Observations Week 14: Patriots Grind Out a Tough 23-14 Win Over Chargers</a> (1,569 words)</p>

Of course when the Patriots play the Jets, it turns into the closest game both teams played all season and was decided by a last second blocked field goal. The defense looked terrible and the offense did just enough to squeak by one of the worst secondaries in the league. If you&#8217;re looking for silver linings in this game it&#8217;s that the Patriots got the win, they&#8217;re 5-2 in control of the division, they have 10 days off before their next game, and they escaped without any additional injuries.</p>
<p>&#8211; To start off, how about that redemption for Chris Jones? Remember it was Jones last year against the Jets who was called for that ridiculous penalty on a field goal in overtime which Nick Folk missed. Jones was called for pushing the lineman from the second level, or as we called it &#8220;Pushgate.&#8221; Folk then nailed the field goal from 15 yards closer and the Jets won the game. Throughout the game the Patriots were close to getting to Folk coming off the edges. The final play saw Jones go right through the middle to get his hands up and swat the ball down. A fitting end to a brutal nail-biter. (...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2014/10/19/notes-and-observations-week-7-amendola-chris-jones-save-the-day-patriots-beat-jets-27-25/">Notes and Observations Week 7: Amendola, Chris Jones Save the Day; Patriots Beat Jets 27-25</a> (1,493 words)</p>
