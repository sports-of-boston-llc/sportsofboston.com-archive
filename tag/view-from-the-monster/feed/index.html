<p>It will be hard for anyone to deny that Jason Varitek&#8217;s age has caught up to him and perhaps the same can be said for David Ortiz. Shortstop was a mess with Julio Lugo, Jed Lowrie, and Nick Green all shelved at one point or another and Lugo was even shipped out of town for essentially nothing. With the inability to solve the backstop and shortstop dilemmas from within the organization while positively impacting the lineup card, the team went outside to get Victor Martinez and familiar face Alex Gonzalez, who was a defensive upgrade as well.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/10/19/red-sox-2009-infield-review/">Red Sox 2009 Infield Review</a> (577 words)</p>

Burnett and instead, tried to wring value out of three ailing veterans. John Smoltz and Brad Penny were coming off surgeries and each agreed to incentive laden contracts in the hopes that at least one of them would return to their past productivity and become an enviable fifth starter. Of course, neither lived up to expectations and were released in the second half. The Red Sox tried the same tactic with Rocco Baldelli, a player with star potential who could never dodge the injury bug long enough to live up to the hype. As a fourth outfielder, he managed to stay relatively healthy and be productive in the role. General Manager Theo Epstein will have similar dilemmas this offseason with Jason Bay&#8217;s free agency (with <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/10/13/jason-bay-heading-to-san-francisco/">early interest from the Giants</a>), with Matt Holliday a possible replacement target.</p>
<p>Before moving forward, we must take a look back. Which players earned their paychecks in 2009? Which group performed the best?

<p>The Sox are 3-2 against the Indians this season and split their earlier two-game set at Fenway. With the playoff spot locked up and no room to move up, the Red Sox will continue to work in the whole roster and keep as many key guys as possible fresh. The starting pitcher&#8217;s stints will likely be short and the regulars in the lineup will be taking extra days and at-bats off.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/10/01/red-sox-face-indians-with-chance-to-rest/">Red Sox Face Indians With Chance to Rest</a> (520 words)</p>

The Red Sox downshifted into a resting for the playoffs mode and will stay in that frame of mind as they should continue to play more of the backups including Josh Reddick, Brian Anderson, and Rocco Baldelli. They need to sharpen the second tier guys in case they are needed and need to rest up the guys like Mike Lowell. This coming series with the Blue Jays might look more like a showcase of future stars as the Red Sox try to keep this balance.</p>
<p>As for the Blue Jays, the Red Sox have won the season series already with an 11-4 mark, including a perfect 6-0 record at home. The Red Sox need to grab a couple wins over the next week to ensure they get the Wild Card and are not totally deflated heading into the playoffs.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/09/28/red-sox-looking-wild-against-blue-jays/">Red Sox Looking Wild Against Blue Jays</a> (267 words)</p>

The Yankees swept the last series in the Bronx as part of their hottest streak of the season, while the Red Sox were sliding, which seemed to put them out of the picture in the East.</p>
<p>However, recently the Red Sox have been the hot team and the Yankees have not played their best ball and watched their division lead slowly and quietly shrink. The Red Sox cannot seize the East lead this weekend, but can close the gap and make the Yankees sweat, even if the Bombers eventually win it.</p>
