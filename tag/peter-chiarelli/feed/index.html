This makes him the eighth GM in Bruins history. This past season ended in disaster, just missing the playoffs then firing GM <strong>Peter Chiarelli</strong> shortly after, and all the rumors about <strong>Claude Julien</strong> getting fired as well.</p>
<p>So Sweeney has to deal with all of this and deal with all of it soon so he can end the Chiarelli era in Boston and begin an era of his own. There are a few things he has to deal with before anything else.</p>
<h2>Keeping Claude?</h2>
<p>It is best for the Bruins organization if Sweeney officially makes up his mind on whether he is going to keep Claude Julien as his Head Coach this season or if he will end up with the same fate as Chiarelli.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/05/22/a-few-things-that-don-sweeney-needs-to-address-right-away/">A Few Things That Don Sweeney Needs to Address Right Away</a> (757 words)</p>

Photo Courtesy Nesn.com" ></a><p>It has been over a month since Peter Chiarelli was fired as the Bruins general manager. Since then, Chiarelli has been hired by the Oilers and the Devils have also filled their general manager vacancy with potential Bruins candidate Ray Shero. The Bruins have still yet to hire aÂ new man to run the front office behind team President CamÂ NeelyÂ despite several interviews. Rumors and reports have suggested that Don Sweeny, the current Bruins assistant general manager, is a likely candidate. But if that is the case, why has he not been named to the post yet?</p>
<p>There is one potential candidate that could be holding everything up: Rangers assistant general manager Jeff Gorton. Gorton is no stranger to Boston, he was the assistant general manager under Mike O&#8217;Connell in Boston and was the interim head during the 2006 offseason before Chiarelli left Ottawa to take over.</p>
<p>As the assistant general manager, Gorton built a substantial part of the 2011 Bruins Stanley Cup Champion team, helping draft both David Krejci and Patrice Bergeron as well as signing Tim Thomas to both his initial deal and his extension. His 2006 offseason as interim general manager was one of the best of the last decade for the Bruins. His first three draft picks were Phil Kessel, Milan Lucic, and Brad Marchand, a haul that any front office executive would be jealous of. He also helped sign Zdeno Chara and Marc Savard that offseason, although Chiarelli and Jeremy Jacobs also had strong influence on those two moves.</p>
<p>Currently in his post as the number two man behind Rangers top man Glen Sather, Gorton has helped build a Rangers team that is in the Eastern Conference Final for the second year in a row. The team advanced to the Stanley Cup last season as well. The Rangers have a strong core of defensemen and a plethora of speed up front, two things the 2015 Bruins were sorely lacking.</p>
<p>The trouble with Boston hiring Gorton is that because the Rangers are still in the playoffs, he is not available to even be interviewed yet and if they advance to the Cup Final he may not be available for another 4-5 weeks, a long time to wait for a team at a crossroads. It is not a sure thing that the Rangers will make Gorton available to interview even then, as Sather is 72 years old and may have Gorton in mind as his eventual replacement.</p>
<p>Gorton would be the best hire, in this writer&#8217;s humble opinion, but the Bruins cannot wait around too long to nab their man. If hired Gorton may want to change coaches, a process that gets more difficult as the offseason continues. He also would have little time to evaluate the roster before the draft in late June and free agency in July. Until the Bruins make a decision the Bruins will remain a front office in flux, which is not good for anyone.</p>

Photo Courtesy AP." ></a><p>Whenever a team enters a season as a favorite to be a Stanley Cup Contender and misses the playoffs, serious questions need to be asked. The Bruins, fresh of a Stanley Cup Final appearance in 2013 and a President&#8217;s Trophy in 2014 looked primed to make some serious noise in 2015. Despite losing Jarome Iginla and Johnny Boychuk prior to the season to the Avalanche and Islanders, respectively, the Bruins still looked to be a contender.</p>
<p>Expectations took a hit when the Bruins began the season 1-4 while playing a poor brand of hockey. They began to right the ship but then the injury bug hit, Boston lost Zdeno Chara and David Krejci for significant parts of the season. Despite these losses, the Bruins were still putting themselves in position to win games. The problem was they werenât finishing. A full 60 minute effort was hard to come by and the Bruins seemed like a squad just going through the motions and waiting until the playoffs. Their play against elite competition was troubling also, going 0-4 against Montreal and 0-3 on a key west coast road trip in December.</p>
<p>A strong month on January was followed by a lackluster February that saw the team suffer another west coast losing streak, this time at four games. March was the month that finally quashed any doubts about the Bruins being contenders. Their five game losing streak in the middle of the month that included losses to three playoff teams and the league worst Sabres. Despite having a chance to sneak into the playoffs on the last day of the season, it would have been naÃ¯ve to think this Bruins team would have made much noise in the postseason.</p>
<p>Several players performed well below expectations this season. The injuries to Chara and Krejci greatly affected their performance while Dennis Seidenberg and Milan Lucic only showed flashes of the players that helped bring Boston to two Cup Finals in three seasons. Gregory Campbell and Daniel Paille were ineffective and have already been informed by the team that they will not be brought back. Chris Kelly was the best player on the team through October, but came back down to Earth offensively while still contributing on defense. Reilly Smith was ineffective throughout the season and did was constantly moved around the lineup.</p>
<p>Loui Eriksson played well as did Carl Soderberg, but at times lacked the necessary physicality. Adam McQuaid was not as effective as years past and Dougie Hamilton played well but was hampered by a late season ribs injury. Patrice Bergeron and Tuukka Rask were stars for the Bruins, but unfortunately Rask had to play in 70 games because his backup, Niklas Svedberg, was woefully ineffective.</p>
<p>Three bright spots for Boston were Patrice Bergeron, David Pastrnak, and Ryan Spooner. Bergeron was an elite player as always and Pastrnak and Spooner joined the team and made heavy contributions after the All-Star break. Both could end up being major pieces of the Bruins moving forward, but the fact that the Bruins relied on two rookies for most of their offensive production was a troubling sign in itself.</p>
<p>The question now is whatâs next for the Bruins in their longer than anticipated offseason. The first shoe dropped earlier this week when the team fired General Manager Peter Chiarelli. Chiarelli had been with the team since 2006 and was a major factor in building the rosters that won a Stanley Cup in 2011 and the Eastern Conference in 2013. His struggles this year were too much for the Bruins, however, and they are now looking for his replacement.</p>
<p>The Bruins will not decimate their core, but it is possible one or two longstanding Bruins could be dealt. Soderberg and McQuaid could very well join Campbell and Paille in playing elsewhere next season. Matt Bartkowski, whose tenure with Boston has left much to be desired, will also probably be wearing a different uniform next season. Zdeno Chara and Milan Lucic have been floated as potential trade names and it is possible that one of them gets dealt this offseason. Malcolm Subban, the teamâs young goaltending prospect, could also be part of a deal.</p>
<p>The major question now is the fate of Coach Claude Julien. Julien, who has one Stanley Cup ring with the Bruins, will remain as coach for the time being. But a new GM could choose to make a move for a new coach, which would allow Chiarelli and Julien to reunite next season; possibly in Toronto.</p>
<p>In retrospect, the 2014-15 Bruins have no one to blame but themselves for their failure to make the playoffs. Although they were not as talented as Bruins teams from the past five seasons, they still had more than enough talent to make the postseason. One major change along with several minor ones has already been made. It seems only as though there will be more changes coming and next seasonâs Bruins team could look quite different from this yearâs squad. It will be a long offseason in Boston.</p>

<h2>Quick Hits:</h2>
<p>He&#8217;s always been a controversial guy. During his 9 year tenure, he undoubtedly took a train-wreck of a franchise and brought them to perennially one of the league&#8217;s top teams. Well, for the most part. On the plus side, he has 8 consecutive playoff appearances, President&#8217;s Trophy, 1 Stanley Cup win, another Cup appearance, and a very strong core. However, he has shown some serious cap mismanagement with the way he cap-strung this team&#8217;s ability to make moves and obviously Neely and the Jacobs&#8217; didn&#8217;t take too kindly to the Bruins missing the playoffs. Rumors indicate that Don Sweeney will replace him as General Manager.</p>
<p>What do you think? Was he fired too quickly or does he deserve this? Who would you want to come be the GM?</p>

Â As it stands, if the Nets lose tonight, they&#8217;re in. Â Yet the season did not transpire as expected, and the catalystÂ for this unforeseenÂ success was addition by subtraction. Â At the start of the year, the two best players on the 2014-2015 Celtics were undeniably Jeff Green and Rajon Rondo. Â Yet, it wasn&#8217;t until after they were traded that this Celtics team really hit their stride. Â The offense became less stagnant, the defense became more formidable, and perhaps most of all, the players look like they&#8217;re having more fun.

<p>Brad Stevens has established himself as the future of Celtics basketball.

At the beginning of the season it was easy to say the more exciting team throughout the whole year would be the Bruins. They had just come off of a season where they won the President&#8217;s Trophy and made another run in the playoffs despite a disappointing finish in the second round against their hated rivals north of the border, the Montreal Canadiens. Sure, they did not replace the scoring hole left by the departure of Jarome Iginla and then they traded away Johnny Boychuk just before the season started, but they were still going to be contenders in the East if not Stanley Cup contenders. There was no way you could even try to make the comparison between the Celtics and the Bruins as to who was going to have the better season or at least be more exciting, right?</p>
<p>Well, here we are midway through February with both teams facing their upcoming trade deadlines and both teams essentially battling for the eighth spot in their respective playoff brackets.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In what can be summed up as a disappointing season for the Bruins so far, the team has showed little signs of being a serious Cup contender and are on the cusp of not making the playoffs at all. The media and fans are quick to point fingers in all directions, but most notably the blame is going toward the General Manager, Peter Chiarelli.</p>
<p>Chiarelli, who has been known as more of a passive GM, gets criticized as being too committed to his core group, which limits the Bruins ability to make big deals. While this may be fair, this is for a good reason. The Bruins core <em>is the reason</em> we don&#8217;t need to make big deals. Outside of Chara, the core of this team includes Tuukka Rask, Patrice Bergeron, David Krejci, Milan Lucic, and Dougie Hamilton. All under thirty years old. A lot of teams would kill for a core like that.</p>
<p>When people want to blame Chiarelli for every single thing that goes wrong with the Bruins, I want to cringe. He&#8217;s an excellent GM. Is her perfect? Of course not. But he&#8217;s put together a great team overt the years with a track record of success. He took a crumbling franchise back in 2007 and slowly, steadily, and patiently built it into the team that won a Stanley Cup and a President&#8217;s Trophy.</p>
<p>So I took the time to lay out three of the main criticisms of Chiarelli and thrown in counter-arguments. Truth be told, it seems silly to me that we even have to have this conversation but that that&#8217;s the way things go.</p>
<h2>1. Chiarelli got lucky when the Bruins won the Cup</h2>
<p>This one drives me crazy. It fits right in with the age-old theme that when things are going well, people praise the players, and when things are going poorly, people blame the GM. Did Tim Thomas stand on his head during that Cup run and play out of his mind for a month and a half? Absolutely. He was incredible. A performance for the generations. And who signed Thomas, despite the fact that he was 34 years old and we had a young superstar in Rask waiting in the wings? Peter Chiarelli.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/01/09/in-defense-of-chiarelli-debunking-5-myths-about-the-controversial-gm/">In Defense of Chiarelli: Debunking 3 Myths about the Controversial GM</a> (708 words)</p>

Arguments have been tossed around that he his too loyal to his &#8220;core&#8221; guys and that a few bad contracts are hurting the B&#8217;s cap situation.

<p>As the saying goes, &#8220;if it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it.&#8221; Just because the Bruins got bounced in the second round by their kryptonite Montreal doesn&#8217;t mean that they have something fundamentally wrong with their line-up. This is a team that finished first in the regular season and made a solid playoff push despite starting four rookie defensemen.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2014/07/15/quiet-off-season-best-option-for-bruins/">Quiet Off-Season Best Option for Bruins</a> (547 words)</p>
