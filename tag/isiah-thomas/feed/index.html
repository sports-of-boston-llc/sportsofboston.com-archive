Well that&#8217;s what happened this week when it was announced that Florida International University hired Isiah Thomas to coach their team. It&#8217;s a sad attempt to grab attention. This is after all, the same Isiah Thomas who has failed at almost every post-playing-career job that he has been hired for.</p>
<p>Isiah&#8217;s been a failure on an executive level in a variety of ways. He bought the CBA for $5 million in 1998 and within two years caused the league&#8217;s bankruptcy, despite having received an offer of $11 million for it to be bought and become the minor leagues of the NBA (of course Isiah rejected it). For normal people, 11 is greater than 0, but in Isiah World, 0 beats all.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/04/20/isiah-thomas-has-found-a-new-home-to-wreck/">Isiah Thomas Has Found a New Home to Wreck</a> (477 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New York Knicks made their first smart move since Patrick Ewing left, firing one of the worst coaches and especially one of the worst GM&#8217;s of all time in Isiah Thomas.</p>
<p>New Knicks president Donnie Walsh seems excited about replacing Isiah:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If I could get the coach I wanted right away, then that would be great, but if it&#8217;s going to take time, then I have to give it that time. I know this: That by getting to this by today, Friday, we still have a good selection of people that are available out there. I will get calls. This is a coveted job, and people will want to coach here. So I&#8217;m going to get calls.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Allow me first to address Quentin Richardson&#8217;s pre-game comments that the Celtics&#8217; Big Three weren&#8217;t a big deal.</p>
<p>HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!</p>
<p>That game was the perfect slap in the face to the Knicks (well, more like knockout blow). Not only did I see the Celtics annihilate the Knicks by over 40 points in a 104-59 win (<a href="http://www.nba.com/games/20071129/NYKBOS/boxscore.html" target="_blank">NBA.com Box Score</a>), I got to do it sitting in Club Section 137 on nice padded seats with food service. Sure the seats were 150 bucks, but it&#8217;s worth it, trust me. The worst part of the win though was that I got to see just 22 minutes from Kevin Garnett. As a result, it was the Glen &#8220;Big Baby&#8221; Davis show. To be honest, Davis showed me a lot of promise as a scorer in this league.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m talking about Glen &#8220;Big Baby&#8221; Davis in the first full paragraph of this post, you know that the game was a blowout. I mean, the Celtics were up by 50 late in the game! The Knicks probably wouldn&#8217;t have fared much better if it was 5-on-4. Here are some stats: the Knicks shot 30.3% from the field (23-76), had 14 turnovers and just 12 assists.</p>
