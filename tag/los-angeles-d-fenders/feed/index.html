				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Los Angeles D-Fenders announced that Gabe Pruitt, who was waived in November due to injury, is healthy and able to play. In an effort to make room for Pruitt on the roster, the D-Fenders have waived shooting guard Charlie Parker. Pruitt, a point guard from USC, attended the 2009 D-Fenders training camp as an allocation player. The Los Angeles native finished his three-year career with the Trojans ranked 27th all-time in scoring with 1,102 points.</p>
<p>Pruitt was drafted in 2007 by the Boston Celtics and was assigned to Bostonâ€™s NBA D-League affiliate during the <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2008/07/30/celtics-player-review-gabe-pruitt/">2007-08 season</a>. He played minimally in the <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/06/12/celtics-player-review-gabe-pruitt-2/">2008-2009 season</a>, and was waived by the Celtics during the summer of 2009 before joining the New York Knicks for the 2009 pre-season.</p>
<p>During a tumultuous two-year tenure with the Celtics, Pruitt never got off on the right foot. After sitting on the bench while the team acquired veteran point guards in his place (Sam Cassell in 2008 and Stephon Marbury in 2009), Pruitt capped off his Celtics career with a <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/02/26/gabe-pruitt-arrested-for-dui/">DUI arrest</a> and <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/02/27/marbuy-signed-pruitt-suspended/">subsequent suspension</a>.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/12/03/former-celtics-guard-gabe-pruitt-signs-with-los-angeles-d-fenders/">Former Celtics Guard Gabe Pruitt Signs with Los Angeles D-Fenders</a> (128 words)</p>
