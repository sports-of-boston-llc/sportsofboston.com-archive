<p align="left">Apparently, Danny Ainge enjoyed reading these player previews, as he has given me more to write about again with the recent acquisitions of Esteban Batista and former Duke guard Dahntay Jones. So, Danny, here we go with what I imagine is the final Celtics player preview before the 2007-2008 season. Jones joins the C&#8217;s with an unguaranteed contract, meaning he must play well in training camp in order to earn a spot on the active roster. His deal is kind of like a minor league deal with an invitation to spring training in baseball. With that said, Jones may have his work cut out for him, as he is staring at three rookies with zero NBA experience that stand in his way. Does Jones have enough to make it?</p>
<p>Yes. The 6&#8217;6&#8243; Jones, believe it or not, was originally a Celtic. His first stint was extremely short-lived, however, as he was sent in a trade with BC star Troy Bell to the Grizzlies for PG Marcus Banks and high school center Kendrick Perkins. As you may know, Bell isn&#8217;t in the NBA anymore, Banks has bounced around, and Perk is the C&#8217;s starting center. So that leaves Jones as the dark horse.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here’s the Celtics Four-Point Play to appear every Wednesday (I know, today&#8217;s the belated edition) on Sports of Boston. This is where I will compile four (4) small and related Celtics facts and offer my own spin on a variety of Celtics news stories. The general format will be a short blurb about the story first, then my reaction tabbed underneath it.</p>
<p>1. As I reported earlier today (<a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2007/09/27/celtics-get-batista-and-jones/" target="_blank">Celtics get Batista and Jones</a>) and was first reported by the Globe, the Celtics have agreed to deals with Uruguayan center Esteban Batista and swingman Dahntay Jones. Batista played sparingly with Atlanta last season, but his eye-popping performance in the FIBA Americas Championship (a tournament-leading 12.4 rebounds per game) is what made him an attractive free agent on the market. Jones had served as a scorer off the bench during his career with the Grizzles, averaging 7.5 points per game last season.</p>
<ul>
<li>Danny Ainge made a couple of good moves here, bringing in guys to compete for spots in training camp. The two additions bring the Celtics roster to 17, which is two more than the league maximum. So what does that mean for Jackie Manuel and Brandon Wallace? Well, I guess they&#8217;re both going to have to play harder to earn their spots, and they won&#8217;t have to back in. Personally, I see Batista definitely making the team, due to his size and apparent rebounding ability. At 24, he still has time to develop, and may become a solid backup center.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m not so sure about Jones. He&#8217;s a veteran, which gives him the edge right away. I&#8217;d lean towards the former Duke star over Wallace and Manuel, as they both will probably playing for the NBDL this year anyway. Jones is a great dunker, and is probably known for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnP32DhQeSE" target="_blank">his dunk over 7&#8217;6&#8243; Houston center Yao Ming.</a></li>
</ul>
