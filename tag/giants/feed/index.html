The Giants have been the one team to have the Patriots figured out. For most of the game on Sunday it appeared like it was going to be more of the same. We were going to be subjected from a perfect performance from Eli Manning, while Tom Brady looked as mortal as he has all season. Luckily for the Patriots and their fans they were the recipient of the lucky break at the right time.</p>
<p>&#8211; No doubt about the fact that Danny Amendola was the savior of that game. His punt return sparked some much needed life into a team that was dragging. I, like everyone else I imagine, have zero idea what Duron Harmon was trying to accomplish. Amendola walks into the end zone if Harmon stays far, far away from him. On the last drive he was right where he had to be to haul in a laser of a pass to keep the drive going on 4th and 10. His awareness produced the necessary yardage on his catch setting up Stephen Gostkowski for the game winner. If Amendola goes down right where he catches that pass there&#8217;s a real chance Gostkowski doesn&#8217;t make that kick. (...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/11/16/notes-and-observations-week-10-gostkowskis-game-winning-field-goal-sends-patriots-past-giants-27-26/">Notes and Observations Week 10: Gostkowski&#8217;s Game-Winning Field Goal Sends Patriots Past Giants 27-26</a> (1,392 words)</p>

They beat the Giants. The teams fought back and forth with many big plays and the Patriots won 27-26. Stephen Gostkowski kicked a field with six seconds left from 54 yards out to win the game.</p>
<p>The game began with a long Patriots touchdown drive capped off by a Scott Chandler touchdown catch. The Giants answered right back with an 87 yard touchdown catch by Odell Beckham on their second offensive play. The teams fought back and forth throughout the second and third quarters with the Giants taking a lead into the fourth.</p>
<p>Tom Brady hit Rob Gronkowski on a 76 yard touchdown to give the Patriots the lead 24-23. After forcing a punt, the Patriots drove down the field highlighted by a 50 yard catch by Brandon LaFell. With the ball at the two yard line, LeGarrette Blount ran into the end zone for a touchdown but the score was called back due to a holding penalty by David Andrews. Despite the penalty, the Patriots were still in position to increase their lead. However, the drive came to a stunning end when Brady threw an interception  at the goal line.</p>
<p>The Giants then drove nearly the entire length of the field and appeared to take the lead on another Beckham touchdown catch, but the play was overturned. The Giants settled for a field goal and a 26-24 lead with less than two minutes to go.</p>
<p>The Patriots took the field needing to get into field goal range for a a chance to win the game. After three straight incompletions, the Patriots faced a fourth and ten. On one of the biggest plays of the day, Brady hit Danny Amendola for a first down. The Patriots got the ball into Giants territory and set up Gostkowski for the game winner. In a truly memorable affair, the Patriots left New Jersey with a one point.</p>
<p>They also may have left with a significant injury. Julian Edelman left the game after the first play of the second quarter. His ankle got rolled up on and he went back to the locker room. He did not  return and the team hasn&#8217;t provided any further details. The Patriots offense had significant trouble moving the ball after Edelman went down for much of the game.</p>
<p>If he is out for a significant amount of time, it will be a huge blow to a New England offense that has already suffered a rash of injuries. He is their best wide receiver and is one player who Brady always turns to in difficult situations. He is a third down machine with a knack for making big catches and moving the chains. He also rarely drops a pass, even when taking a big hit.</p>
<p>In retrospect, the Patriots got a huge road win but may have suffered a serious loss as well. The next few days are crucial for Edelman, as much about the severity of his injury will be known by the middle of the week. The Patriots face Buffalo next Monday night and that is followed by a match-up with the vaunted Denver defense. If Edelman can&#8217;t play, he will be immediately missed.</p>

However, no Eagle had his name called in either of the first two days of the NFL Draft. On the third day, four BC players were taken, making this edition of the Draft the most successful for BC since 1995, when there were also four Eagles draftees (Mike Mamula, Pete Mitchell, Stephen Boyd and that year&#8217;s Mr. Irrelevant Michael Reed).</p>
<p>The unquestionable star of last year&#8217;s team, running back <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/16889/andre-williams">Andre Williams</a>, was the first to come off the board, with the 13th pick of the fourth round (113th overall), to the New York Giants. Williams had a phenomenal senior season, rushing for 2,177 yards and 18 touchdowns, and finishing fourth in the Heisman voting and winning the Doak Walker Award as the nation&#8217;s top RB. He was also a consensus All-American along with Arizona&#8217;s <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/16942/ka'deem-carey">Ka&#8217;Deem Carey</a>, who outplayed Williams in <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2014/01/01/bc-gets-blown-out-in-advocare-v100-bowl/">the AdvoCare V100 Bowl</a> and was drafted by the Bears four picks after Williams.</p>

<p>I wanted to reflect on a few things first, because history tends to repeat itself and unfortunately for the Patriots, it’s repeated itself a few times in the last eight years. Now, the pessimistic fan would say the New England Patriots are the Atlanta Braves: another playoff run, another failure. There is obvious truth in that statement, but the Patriots are a victim of their own success. This isn’t baseball, where a large payroll can guarantee admission on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>The Patriots have made the playoffs 9 out of the last 11 seasons and that excellence has allowed them to reach the biggest games in the sporting world.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2012/02/08/hey-patriots-coffee-is-for-closers/">Hey Patriots, &#8220;Coffee is for Closers&#8221;</a> (2,094 words)</p>
