My goal was to gain further insight as to whether what I was watching was sport or some kind of voyeurism akin to mud-wrestling: mostly there just to amuse the  audience that was mostly male. What I got was a blowout by the Cosmonaughties  against the Nutcrackers, 168-61. I also found some answers to the questions I  posed last time around.</p>
<p>To begin with, there is too much sheer athleticism to call this  purely voyeurism. The ability to skate alone suggests as such, but the  women of roller derby have to do far more than just skate. The jammers  must navigate a pack of aggressive opponents and teammates, find the  open seams, and accelerate through them. The pack must control its speed  long enough to allow its jammer to get by, then react to whoever  becomes the lead jammer by either accelerating or decelerating in an  effort to make it easier on the leader (if they&#8217;re on the same team) or  harder (if they&#8217;re on opposite teams). A fast pack will be harder for  the lead jammer to catch up to, but it will cause the pack to space out,  making it easier for the jammer to pass once she gets there. Meanwhile,  a slow pack will be reached sooner by the jammer (who must complete a  full lap before she can score), but it will remain tighter together,  making penetration more difficult. If all of this sounds like strategy  to you, it should.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/04/19/boston-derby-dames-roller-derby-revisited/">Boston Derby Dames: Roller Derby Revisited</a> (421 words)</p>
