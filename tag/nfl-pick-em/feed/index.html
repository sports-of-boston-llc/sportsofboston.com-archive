<p>Such back-and-forth action really put our Pick &#8216;Em up for grabs. But when the dust settled and the Patriots had emerged victorious, who reigned supreme atop our standings?

(AP Photo/Animal Planet, Keith Barraclough)" ></a><p>Welcome to Super Bowl XLIX. The Patriots and Seahawks are ready to fight for the Championship in Arizona. Everything has come down to this one game, both for these two franchises and our panel of experts. With odds makers not making either team favored, it&#8217;s pretty much a pick the winner scenario. That caused a split in our panel in choosing whether the unstoppable force in New England&#8217;s offense or the immovable object in Seattle&#8217;s defense will emerge victorious.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a disagreement as to how high-scoring the game will be, though the passing attack is thought to give way somewhat with Marshawn Lynch and LeGarrette Blount giving an explosive element on the ground. And for the Super Bowl, in such a quarterback driven league, only one pick set has a quarterback as the game&#8217;s MVP.</p>
<p>Scoring will be largely as before, with the addition of choosing the game&#8217;s MVP. Furthermore, ALL POINTS WILL BE DOUBLED! In addition, in the event of a tie, we&#8217;ll also be guessing the length of the game&#8217;s longest drive, in minutes and seconds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Successfully picking the winner of each game is worth four points.</li>
<li>Picking the total number of touchdowns scored by both teams COMBINED in each game is worth two points if guessed to within one, or four points if guessed exactly right.</li>
<li>Picking the MVP of the game is worth two points.</li>
<li>Picking the total number of yards thrown in each game by WHICHEVER quarterback throws the most is worth two points if guessed to within 50, or four points if guessed to within 10, or ten points if guessed exactly right.</li>
<li>Guessing the length of the game&#8217;s longest drive, IN MINUTES AND SECONDS, is for tiebreaking purposes only.</li>
</ul>
<p>So with that out of the way, pick sets are below. And be sure to come back post-game for the final results.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2015/02/01/2014-2015-nfl-expert-picks-super-bowl/">2014-2015 NFL Expert Picks: Super Bowl</a> (47 words)</p>

<p>For our picks, one game was easier to pick than the other, which caused a split vote from our panel. Either way, the defenses in Seattle are thought to make that game less of a shootout than their New England counterparts.</p>
<p>As before:</p>
<ul>
<li>Successfully picking the winner of each game is worth <strong>two points</strong>.</li>
<li>Picking the total number of touchdowns scored by both teams COMBINED in each game is worth <strong>one point</strong> if guessed to within one, or <strong>two points</strong> if guessed exactly right.</li>
<li>Picking the total number of yards thrown in each game by WHICHEVER quarterback throws the most is worth <strong>one point</strong> if guessed to within 50, or <strong>two points</strong> if guessed to within 10, or <strong>five points</strong> if guessed exactly right.</li>

Thanks to most of the winner picks being alike, not too much ground was gained, but TD and yardage totals did shift some things around.

With how long it took to settle so many spots, this should be a very good postseason to watch.</p>
<p>To that end, we&#8217;re here once more to bring you our selections for how the postseason will turn out, starting with the Wildcard Round. Only one game was picked unanimously, while two others were relatively clear to our panel, and the final game being much closer.</p>
<p>For our Pick &#8216;Em, scoring is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Successfully picking the winner of each game is worth <strong>two points</strong>.</li>
<li>Picking the total number of touchdowns scored by both teams COMBINED in each game is worth <strong>one point</strong> if guessed to within one, or <strong>two points</strong> if guessed exactly right.</li>
<li>Picking the total number of yards thrown in each game by WHICHEVER quarterback throws the most is worth <strong>one point</strong> if guessed to within 50, or <strong>two points</strong> if guessed to within 10, or <strong>five points</strong> if guessed exactly right.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the season, we&#8217;re here to bring our picks as to how the season will go. Denver and New England are getting plenty of love again, while the Seahawks have pretenders to their top status in the NFC. Otherwise, a lot of teams look to jockey for position from there.</p>
<p>Scoring in our Pick &#8216;Em is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Successfully picking a team to make the playoffs is one point, or two points for a correct division winner pick instead.</li>
<li>Successfully the #1 seed in each conference exactly is worth six points, then five points for #2, and so on.</li>
<li>Successfully picking which #1 seed will wind up with the NFL&#8217;s best record is worth two points.</li>
<li>In the event of a tie, we&#8217;ll also be picking which team will wind up with the draft&#8217;s #1 pick, then #2 pick, then #3 pick.</li>
</ul>
<p>So now that that&#8217;s out of the way, the complete picks are below.
