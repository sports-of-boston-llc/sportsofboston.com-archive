				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Red Sox (3-3) scored first and held a 2-1 lead in the fourth, but Clay Buchholz and the bullpen faltered from there and the Blue Jays (3-2) scored a 10-2 blowout win over the Sox.</p>
<p>Manny Ramirez doubled home David Ortiz in the first and Sean Casey drove in J.D. Drew in the fourth, but the Jays busted out 11 hits and six different players had RBIs. Casey&#8217;s throwing error in the fourth allowed two runs to score and the Jays never looked back from their 3-2 lead.</p>
<p>In his first start of the season, Buchholz pitched five innings, allowing six hits, four runs (three of which were earned), struck out seven and walked two. The bullpen really let the Blue Jay offense blow the door open as Kyle Snyder allowed two runs in a third of an inning and Bryan Corey allowed four in just a third of an inning.</p>
<p>The three game series wraps up tomorrow with a 1pm game at Rogers Center as the Jays go for the three game sweep.</p>
<p><strong>My Take: </strong>I think this is what we&#8217;re going to see in Buchholz for the first few weeks of the season. He will get his strikeouts and won&#8217;t walk too many people, but as he feels out his new body (and he is noticeably bigger), there will be growing pains along the way &#8211; no pun intended.</p>
<p>Many picked the Blue Jays to win the division this year as a surprise. I don&#8217;t see it happening, but the offense led by Alex Rios looks pretty scary, especially with the Frank Thomas hitting well.</p>
<p>Tomorrow&#8217;s pitching match-up is &#8211; as the English say &#8211; &#8220;rather tasty&#8221; as Josh Beckett makes his 2008 regular season debut against Roy Halladay.</p>

<p>Hideki Okajima pitched a scoreless ninth inning and earned the win as the Sox bats woke up in extra innings. In the 10th, Manny Ramirez doubled home David Ortiz and Julio Lugo after Big Papi was intentionally walked before him. Papelbon was shaky in the bottom of that inning, allowing three hits and 1 ER, but escaped with the save in a 6-5 win.</p>
<p>Rookie RF Brandon Moss, a late addition for an injured J.D. Drew, hit a game-tying home run in the ninth off of Huston Street to knot the game at 4-4.</p>
<p>Japan native Daisuke Matsuzaka started and looked shaky early on against the Aâ€™s, allowing 2 runs in the first, but he settled down to go 5 innings. He did not get the win after Kyle Snyder failed to hold the lead in the sixth inning.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last month, the Sox have been busy trying to sure up their bullpen. Last week, the Red Sox inked middle relievers Dan Kolb and Dan Miceli to minor league contracts with an invitation to Spring Training. If either pitcher makes the squad, they will earn $650,000 plus incentives.</p>
<p>The Red Sox also agreed to terms with reliever Kyle Snyder and lefty specialist Javier Lopez. Lopez is scheduled to make $840,000 next season while Snyder will earn $835,000. Both players avoided arbitration with their deals.</p>
<p>The only Red Sox player that remains eligible for arbitration is gold glove first baseman Kevin Youkilis. Youk, who made $424,500 last year, has asked for $3.7 million, while the Sox have countered with $2.525 million.</p>
