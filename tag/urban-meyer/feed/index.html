This time, we are learning shocking details about his heavy angel dust use and withdrawal from family and friends. We are also learning about former first class coaches aware of his drug use and even one coach going as far as covering up failed drug tests, according to Rolling Stone. All these factors combined to jeopardize not just his career but his life.</p>
<p>The story, written by Paul Solotaroff, who interviewed Hernandez&#8217;s family friends, high school teammates and NFL sources, offered explanations as to why Hernandez immersed himself in a life of drugs and violence despite a luxurious career, eventually leading to his downfall and murder indictment.</p>
<p>According to the article, Hernandez was already in jeopardy of loosing his job with the Patriots even before the murder investigation began due to heavy angel dust use.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2013/08/28/aaron-hernandezs-heavy-angel-dust-use-jeapordized-his-life/">Aaron Hernandez&#8217;s Heavy Angel Dust Use Jeapordized his Life</a> (263 words)</p>

<p>Meyer, who coached Hernandez at the University of Florida for three years, had been rather quiet when it came to the Hernandez situation until now. Meyer has come out to address the criticism of how he and his coaching staff handled disciplinary actions when it came to Hernandez, who is currently being held without bail on a first-degree murder charge.</p>
<p>Meyer and his team have been the center of mounting criticism on the way they handled Hernandez as a collegian. Critics have blamed the coach for Hernandez&#8217;s transgressions in college, some even going as far as to blame the coach for Hernandez&#8217;s present choices, arguing the coach should have done more to discipline the tight end.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2013/07/07/urban-meyer-defends-against-criticism-in-aaron-hernandez-case/">Urban Meyer Defends Against Criticism in Aaron Hernandez Case</a> (502 words)</p>

<p>However, the 2010 season is a minor hiccup in a incredibly successful tenure. Meyer won two national championships with the Gators in 2006 and 2008, and led his team to the Sugar Bowl in 2009.

(Getty Images)" ></a><p>In the spirit of this Sunday&#8217;s game against the Dolphins I would like to talk wildcat, or in this instance, wild<em>pat</em>. There is no doubt that in the 2010 draft we will see one of the most interesting prospects turn pro and his name is Tim Tebow.</p>
<p>I can hear all the groans now &#8211; &#8216;Not another Tebow story, I <em>hate</em> that god-loving, <a href="http://ncaafootball.fanhouse.com/2009/07/23/tim-tebow-says-hes-still-a-virgin-saving-himself-for-marriage/">virgin</a>!&#8217; By the way, can we really believe that Tim Tebow, the star quarterback at the University of Florida is still a virgin? In a world where Tiger Woods can get caught juggling three girlfriends and a wife at the same time, I don&#8217;t know what I can or cannot believe anymore.</p>
<p>Back to the point, and that is that Tim Tebow could be suiting up for the Patriots next year. Sources have said that Bill Belichick has grown very fond of Tebow from sitting in on Gators&#8217; practices and according to several reports, Belichick has developed a <a href="http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/story?id=09000d5d80649978&amp;template=with-video&amp;confirm=true">great relationship</a> over the years with Florida head coach Urban Meyer.<br />
