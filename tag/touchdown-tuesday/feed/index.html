<p><em>Touchdown Tuesday is a weekly column on all things Patriots:</em><br />
Five down, 11 to go, right? We&#8217;re five weeks into the season and the Patriots haven&#8217;t needed to break a sweat in winning their first five by a combined score of 182-65 (good for the most points scored and the fifth fewest points given up in the NFL so far). The Patriots have won in a bunch of different ways using a bunch of different players.<br />
Case in point was this past Sunday when the 2-2 Browns invaded Foxboro. For the first time all season, Randy Moss wasn&#8217;t a big factor and Tom Brady completed less than 70% of his passes. Running back Laurence Maroney missed his second consecutive game with a groin injury and Rodney Harrison was a little rusty after missing the first four games&#8230;.<br />
Yawn, a 34-17 trouncing.<br />
Donte Stallworth (4 catches, 64 yards, TD) finally got some touches and Ben Watson (first career 100 yard game, 2 TDs) was stellar. And the defensive stars on defense? Tedy Bruschi and Junior Seau, combined age of 72).<br />

<p style="text-align: left">Sunday was just great. There&#8217;s nothing like the opening day of the NFL. It may not have the history of opening day in Major League Baseball, but seeing your team run out of the tunnel onto the field for the first time still gives me goosebumps.</p>
<p>Before the 2004 season (the year the Pats took down the Eagles), I remember looking at the schedule and the Patriots roster and commenting to a friend, &#8216;In all honesty, we shouldn&#8217;t lose more than a game or two all season.&#8217; Well, the Patriots proved me right, losing only to Pittsburgh on the road and that bizarre collapse by Brady and the boys on Monday Night Football against the Dolphins. Other than that, the prophecy was filled and the Pats beat both co-NFL MVPs on their way to a Super Bowl XXXIX win against the Eagles.</p>
<p>Get ready New England, because our team is locked, loaded and ready to start the march towards Super Bowl XLII in Phoenix.</p>
<p>The Patriots were simply dominant in Sunday&#8217;s 38-14 win over the J-E-T-S, Jets Jets Jets. Despite missing two of their defensive stop gaps in Rodney Harrison and Richard Seymour, the Pats never seemed in any trouble of faltering in against the unproven Jets. That&#8217;s the key thing to remember here. The Jets may be the best competition in the AFC East this season but they are far from an elite team. After consulting several different media outlets it&#8217;s apparent that not only are the Patriots receiving heaps of accolades from their performance, but everyone seems to be keeping the good start in perspective. The Pats have no room for error with the San Diego Chargers coming into town next Sunday night.<br />
