<h2>Eagles never trail, but can never bury Yale</h2>
<p>There was a sense that this might be a high scoring affair since Yale is the top scoring team in the nation and the Eagles are third. The feeling was probably confirmed when Carl Sneep of the Eagles dumped the puck out of the BC zone and it bounded past Ryan Rondeau at the other end for a shorthanded goal and a 2-1 Eagle lead. There were also two four-on-four goals, three power play goals, and an extra attacker goal in the game.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/03/29/bc-outduels-yale-to-advance-to-frozen-four/">BC Outduels Yale to Advance to Frozen Four</a> (304 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It may be painful to write these words, but it&#8217;s more important that the City of Boston participated in and won another championship, this time in the realm of college hockey as Jerry York&#8217;s Boston College Eagles defeated the Notre Dame Irish 4-1 Saturday night.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worse that I will always hate the Eagles due to my love for Boston University Terriers hockey, but I have to give credit where credit is due. The Eagles were the hottest team at the hottest time and have been the best team in college hockey the last three seasons (losing twice in the final Frozen Four game before winning it all this year). They also currently have one of the best players in all of college hockey in Nathan Gerbe, who of course was in the Championship game mix with two more goals to give him 35 in the season.</p>
