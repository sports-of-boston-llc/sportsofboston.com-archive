The column appeared on Page 6 of the Thursday Herald with teases on the front and back pages, and the Boston Herald&#8217;s website also featured <a href="http://bostonherald.com/sports/columnists/view/20110106welcome_to_my_coming-out_party/srvc=home&amp;position=1" target="_blank">Buck&#8217;s coming-out column</a> on the homepage.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It’s my hope that from now on I’ll be more involved. I’m not really sure what I mean by being “involved,” but this is a start: I’m gay,&#8221; said Buckley to close his column.</p></blockquote>
<p>As you may know, Buck tends to get stuck telling tangent stories whether he&#8217;s writing, on the radio, or on TV, but in his column on Thursday, he stuck to his story, explaining why he came out now and why he took so long to do so. Let&#8217;s face it: while we as a society have made tremendous strides in equality, coming out of the closet is still very difficult. I can&#8217;t imagine the pressure Buck must have faced. He knew he wanted to come out, but he didn&#8217;t know when the time was right.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2011/01/07/steve-buckley-gay-announcement-took-courage/">Steve Buckley Gay Announcement Took Courage</a> (398 words)</p>
