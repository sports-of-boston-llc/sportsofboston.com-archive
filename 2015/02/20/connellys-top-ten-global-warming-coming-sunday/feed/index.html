		<description><![CDATA[I just watched Hagler-Hearns again.  Best round was the first, not the second.  They stood toe-to-toe from the beginning until the end.  Not so in the second.  Thanks for your insights...

		<description><![CDATA[Awesome spoiled list.  Great to read through it and realize how right you are.  

Other than Boston not being a college football town, much to my chagrin, we are in the best sports place in the world.

That&#039;s not a slight to BC by the way.  It&#039;s a slight to the fans who don&#039;t pay attention.  I was at the USC game last year and there were plenty of empty seats for the ESPN prime time game of the week (honoring Wells Crowther to boot).

MPC - REPLY - Good point that USC game might have been one of the top ten local sporting events of the year and they can&#039;t even get the student body there never mind alumni - I do think after watching them butcher the Luke Kuechly campaign that they might have the worst marketing team (Fenway Sports?) around]]></description>
