		<description><![CDATA[With all the 2/3 pitchers the Sox signed, a la the &quot;Ace by Commission&quot;, they obviously could use THE guy in Hamels. However, with their star-studded lineup, they will score runs in droves which gives them the flexibility to wait and see with their pitchers. They can wait until the deadline, or at least until summer, to see what they have in guys like Porcello, Masterson, Miley, and which version of Buchholz they&#039;ll get. This team will win some games.

And, regarding your comment that the Sox need Hamels to become a contender again, Vegas has them among top teams to win it all.]]></description>
