		<description><![CDATA[My picks for lighting the torch
1. Mike Erouzione (Olympic hero) or maybe even a bunch from 1980 team
2. Joan Benoit Samuelson (1st female Olympic marathon and gold medal)


no Bill and Tom, ZERO Olympic experience, and by then they will be at least 7 years from playing in Boston
no Bobby Orr, he is a Canadian, never played in the Olympics

REPLY - MPC - Excellent point on Bobby Orr - you are right / Benoit from Maine which is in Canada isn&#039;t it - what I loved about her win was just qualifying 30 days after knee surgery.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ortiz .264? Where you getting that from? His batting avg with Sox is .290 and played almost all his games at DH.

REPLY - MPC - You are right my mistake - I took it off Baseball Reference splits must have looked at the wrong number .286 DH]]></description>
