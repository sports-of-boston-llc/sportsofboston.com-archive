		<description><![CDATA[You are wrong regarding the 3rd down catch by Seattle which led to their first TD. It was extremely clear that the receiver did not get a first down.
 He was one yard shy on the catch and tackle. I was amazed Belichik didnt throw the red flag. This game should not have to come down to Butler&#039;s interception to win

Also, the official was clearly staring at the Pats punter when he was hit in his plant leg. The only logical conclusion on why it was not roughing the kicker is the ref did not know the rule. Pathetic for a super bowl.

REPLY - MPC - I was agreeing bad spot]]></description>
