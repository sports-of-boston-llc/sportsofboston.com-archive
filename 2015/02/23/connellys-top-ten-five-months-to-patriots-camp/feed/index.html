		<description><![CDATA[I have been thinking the exact same thing about the ISIS victims.  You have to know the end result so why not try to go down swinging?

I&#039;m not saying that they are wrong at all - I&#039;m just confused.  It is deep in the human nature to fight for survival which is why it is so puzzling that they never seem to be doing that.

I wonder if some tried to flee and were tortured beyond belief so the others think their best option is to do anything but that.

It&#039;s sad and someone has to do enough to make it stop.  A good start would be to have the administration at least admit to what is going on and who is responsible.  If the Muslim world is not going to do enough to police their own, then don&#039;t be afraid to call them out on it.  I&#039;ve had enough of hearing about how &quot;violent extremists come from all different backgrounds and ideologies&quot;.  Not at this point in history.  

Stop making inept comparisons.  The Inquisition lasted for 345 years and 3,000 people were killed.  Spanish socialists killed 6,832 members of the Catholic clergy in the summer of 1936 alone.  Muslim terrorists killed more than 3,000 people in one day.

The Crusades and the Inquisition also happened hundreds of years ago - let&#039;s focus on now.]]></description>
