		<description><![CDATA[interesting discussion on brady v. montana.  i think brady is firmly in the lead, only because he has minimum 2 if not even 4 more years to get a 5th ring.  if he does, the debate is totally done in my opinion.

also, montana led 1 4th-quarter clutch drive in the SB.  tom brady has now given his team the lead, in the 4th quarter, in 4 of his 6 SB appearances - with 2 of those 4 essentially winning the game outright (rams and panthers bowls).

granted, that&#039;s a discussion of clutch QB not the better QB.  still, i would take brady over montana on any given sunday.

REPLY - MPC - Amazing to see how many 4th quarter comeback drives Brady has had in postseason]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bottom line - Montana played measurably better than Brady in the postseason.  That has to matter!

Jerry Rice was a great one, sure, but so are Randy Moss and Rob Gronkowski. Bill Walsh was a great coach, sure, but so is Bill Belichick.  

Your arguments seem more partisan to me than balanced: a niners fan could make as many arguments as you do, and they would be about as convincing.  Brady&#039;s accomplishments, viewed objectively, are roughly comparable to Montana&#039;s and no more.  To call the debate a &quot;knock-out&quot;? - I don&#039;t see it.

Ask yourself this: how many Super Bowls would Joe Montana have won had he been coached by Bill Belichick?  And what does your answer to that question imply for the comparison between Brady and Montana?

REPLY - MPC - My point on the coaches is that Walsh was an offensive genius - Brady has some paper boy calling signals for him / we agree to disagree]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ummm..  You do know that 45 TD to 21 Int is a better ratio than 53 TD to 26 Int, don&#039;t you?

Montana&#039;s postseason passer rating was 95.6; Brady&#039;s only 89.0, despite leaguewide passer ratings about 10 pts higher during Brady&#039;s career.  I love Tom Brady, but Montana is alive and well in the GOAT discussion!

REPLY - MPC - So you are saying Montana is better or are you making a math statement - if you don&#039;t think what Brady has accomplished surpasses Montana I&#039;m going to have to say you are way off base. If you want Montana in the discussion that&#039;s fine but its not questionable. If you gave Brady Bill Walsh as an offensive coordinator, Jerry Rice, John Taylor, Roger Craig and Dwight Clark along with a  fixed lineup every year because of player restrictions and the Cincy defense twice to go against - c&#039;mon man.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[that was inexcusable by zolak.  he called in 2x to Toucher &#038; Rich for the morning program but then couldn&#039;t get out of bed to do a show.  interesting move... particularly as he was the bandwagon leader most of the season, and was the single voice out of all 3 primary shows on 98.5 that never wavered on pats this year.  would think he would want to puff out his chest a bit on the radio.

REPLY - MPC  - said he was at airport but you would think he would use every ounce to get on that show by phone or whatever it took - why did have to fly home with team?]]></description>
