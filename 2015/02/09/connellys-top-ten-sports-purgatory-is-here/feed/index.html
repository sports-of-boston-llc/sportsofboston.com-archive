		<description><![CDATA[I believe Phil Jackson, with even more titles than Auerbach, also only got one Coach of the Year.

It also should be pointed out that the Coach of the Year award is named the Red Auerbach award!

REPLY - MPC - Maybe they figured that Jackson should win with Jordan and Pippen and Kobe and Shaq]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fred Brown to James Worthy, and the Webber timeout. Freak plays, and Dean Smith was that close without winning a title. Amazing...considering all that talent. 

Dean Smith did teach a team oriented game, similar to the Celtics. Pointing to the player who passed the ball if you scored. Four corners drove me nuts though!

Only guy that could hold Michael Jordan to under 20 points. 

Great BC hoops moment when the Eagles beat UNC, Tar Heels were a 1 seed with Wallace and Stackhouse. Eagles had Curley, Huckabee, Abram, Abrams and others. 

Shane Vereen&#039;s game in the SB reminded me of Jermaine Wiggins&#039; game in the snow vs Oakland. Unsung hero.

REPLY - MPC - Good note Wiggins had a great run and had a big catch in super bowl drive / Also good note on how close he was to not winning Smith that is  / If I remember right Dean Smith said some classless things about BC after that game]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[dean smith coment.  I was at UNC during one of the championships and it is amazing he didn&#039;t win more with the talent he had over the years.  the old joke was, name the only person to hold Michael Jordan to less then 20 points a game: answer Dean Smith

REPLY - MPC - That&#039;s a good one - Jordan never forgave him for keeping him off the cover of SI when he was a Freshman]]></description>
