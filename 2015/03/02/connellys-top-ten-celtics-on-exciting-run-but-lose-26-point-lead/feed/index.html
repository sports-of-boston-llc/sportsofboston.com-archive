		<description><![CDATA[-Right on with Thomas, electrifying!
-Fumble stats are interesting, yes, where is that Deflate-Gate report anyway?  
-On the FDR speech at Fenway, you left out the part from Bill O&#039;Reilly&#039;s book, where O&#039;Reilly, then a young concessionaire selling Fenway Franks for the event, saw FDR prior to the speech in the Sox clubhouse dancing the Charleston with his mistress.  Only to return to his wheel chair for the speech to gain sympathy from the American public.

REPLY - MPC - He was selling Cotton Candy - I bet if you look at all these journalists they have either sensationalized their experiences or their cleveage]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After his third game as a Celtic, Isaiah Thomas had already passed Rondo in free throws made1

Do you think that he was named after the Piston&#039;s Hall of Famer?  He is about the right age.

REPLY - MPC - I read that he was named after him]]></description>
