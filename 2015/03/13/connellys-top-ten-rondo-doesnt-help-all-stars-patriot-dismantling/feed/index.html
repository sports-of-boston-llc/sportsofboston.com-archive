		<description><![CDATA[If Rondo&#039;s performance doesn&#039;t imrove, his career could be close to over. His on-court performance has deteriorated massively since his early years in the league.  Once upon a time, he shot 50% from the field, 65% from the line, penetrated with regularity, played elite on-the-ball defense, took it coast to coast after pulling a defensive rebound, and gave the ball up quickly, getting the team into its offense. He doesn&#039;t do any of those things anymore! His attitude is really the least of his problems.

REPLY - MPC - Almost like Nomar&#039;s demise]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, Richardson rushed for more than a yard per carry less than any other Colt RB with more than 10 carries, and that&#039;s with defenses loading up against Luck&#039;s passing. He&#039;s a stiff. I&#039;ll agree with you on global warming and Tebow will be an NFL QB before he&#039;s a Patriot. 
Cheers, see you on Opening Day, the best day of the year!

REPLY - MPC - I&#039;ll take two out of three - opening day Monday - lets hope off to a good start at home]]></description>
