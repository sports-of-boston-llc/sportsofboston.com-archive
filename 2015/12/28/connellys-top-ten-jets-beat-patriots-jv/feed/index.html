		<description><![CDATA[For biggest home runs in Red Sox history, I would still rate Carbo&#039;s homer slightly bigger than Hendu&#039;s homer in the Angels series. This is not diminishing Henderson&#039;s homer by any means. But Carbo saved the Sox from losing game 6 of the World Series, Henderson saved the Red Sox from losing the ALCS. Either way, both were HUGE. I agree with Henderson having a statue in his name if the Sox hadn&#039;t blown game 6 of the Mets World Series.

REPLY - MPC - I guess the only difference is that Hendu was last strike Carbo was 7th or 8th]]></description>
