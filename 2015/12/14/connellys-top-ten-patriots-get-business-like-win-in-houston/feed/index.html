		<description><![CDATA[Can&#039;t believe how bad Cassel has regressed. Should be squishing grapes for Bledsoe. 

The only thing rarer than a Hillary2016 bumper sticker is someone who admits to voting for Obama twice.

REPLY - MPC - Don&#039;t get behind a Elizabeth Warren, Obama fender - you&#039;ll never get to work]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Houston turf is a curse now, because they changed it out in September, so they&#039;re pretty much like everyone else:http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13684348/houston-texans-switch-artificial-surface-rest-2015 

Hope there are no bear-hunting parties. Easier these days to see a bear in the wild than it was to see a great white in the 70&#039;s.  I have friends in a bucolic suburb, Madison, NJ, that has had a black bear walking through their yards this Fall. Around here it happens... uh-oh.

REPLY - MPC - brown lie down - black react - or something like that]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Celtics just might learn how to win those games. Still a work in progress, which is being made. If they get a ringer with that Nets&#039; draft pick... 
One question: Where are the comments about global warming you like to make now that it is 50 degrees every day in December? 
Cheers!

REPLY - MPC - I LOVE GLOBAL WARMING - I&#039;m a huge fan! I am moving a little bit if that makes you any happier I guess I would ask what made warm winters in the 1910&#039;s and dust bowl and ice age melt - I&#039;m not sure they know exactly why - I&#039;ll call you next day my car doesn&#039;t start though]]></description>
