		<description><![CDATA[1. shut up and let record speak.  Unfortunately, rest of country HATES pats and Brady, so my guess is at least 4 games (he never beat his wife though)
2. Prospect list reminds us, trade the prospect for real value all the time.  always overvalued
3. Dr. Jekle comment means more inconsistency, whereas, some you mentioned are just plain CRAZY &quot;OIL Can&quot;, Sanderson and Lee come to mind.
4.best outfield AGREE, Evans should be in the Hall and Lynn would be if he had a longer career.  
5. Vermont K great wiki reference, thanks

REPLY - MPC - Can, Sanderson were definitely up and down - Lee was consistent / he will get more than the wife beater]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[the new ESPN format is the worst.  terrible decision.  can&#039;t find leading articles, not very functional.  no clue who thought it was a good idea.

D-Lowe def had his ups and downs, but i recall that his last few years (and almost all of his postseasons) were pretty consistent until wheels fell off right at end.  he is one of my all-time favorites!

i think it&#039;s worse if anyone on pats goes on offensive.  sadly, they just need to take their lumps.  brady is too big for all this, he will never speak his mind.  the things he might say in retirement... that should be fun.

over/under on colts deficit at halftime of their game this year?  belichick will try and drop 80 on them if he can.

REPLY - MPC - Colts violated an unspoken nfl rule like Mangini - imagine if every team called out all the cheaters - ie. juicers, salary cap cheaters, throwing games for draft picks /* D lowe games pitched hung over probably high]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tigers OF in the 1920s had Ty Cobb- Harry Heilmann- Heinie Manush.  All three are in the Hall of Fame.  And of course the &#039;61 Yankees had Yogi Berra- Mickey Mantle- Roger Maris.

REPLY - MPC - I would say the only difference with 61 and 75 is the quality of defense from the Sox - good point on Tigers]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you want to talk &quot;Old School,&quot; that trio might not even the best Sox outfield of all time. Tris Speaker (single best Sox OF ever), Harry Hooper and Duffy Lewis helped Sox win 1912 and 1915 Series. Two are in the Hall. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Outfield

REPLY - MPC - NESN didn&#039;t cover those 1912 games - Remy was sick - Pre ruth is tough to compare but obviously solid]]></description>
