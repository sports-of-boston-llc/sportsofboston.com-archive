		<description><![CDATA[-Odd to me that the sports media represented &quot;The Deflator&quot; text as having happened shortly before or after the AFC Championship game, and Ted Wells seemed to use it that way, when it was 8 months prior in the off season in May 2014. The Pats attorneys don&#039;t seem to be bringing that up.

-Is there a worse guy in sports than Paul Pierce?  Yes, and the list is long.    

-Agree on peanuts in Cracker Jacks, get them outta there!  We wouldn&#039;t even have to change the song as it says &quot;peanuts and cracker jacks.&quot;

-Does Ted Wells remind anyone of Jackie Chiles from Seinfeld?

-Wells seems like a bit of a loose cannon with his constant chirping in the media.  Under questioning he seems like he would crack pretty easily.  He had 242 pages or whatever it was and he still feels the need to defend himself?  Thin skin.

MPC - REPLY - REally strange that Wells came out and defended himself don&#039;t see that often - I guess he is on thin ice with his suppositions]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would substitute Zane Smith for Ken Brett. As I recall when Brett came up with Boston, he threw pretty hard. Zane was as much of a soft tosser as the others on the list. 
I thought Ned Martin was the best on radio, with a great right hand man in Jim Woods. 
Cusick and Pierson on TV were great. There were many times Cusick would call out a Bruins goal, with Johnny coming back with &quot;I don&#039;t know Fred, it looked like (insert player&#039;s name) may have tipped it in&quot;, and Pierson being right on the replay.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Did you read some Pesky-love website recently?  All I remember is my grandfather telling me how Pesky was the Bill Buckner of his generation.  Even Pesky takes blame for the CHOKE in the world series.  Longevity, committment to the Sox, and being a good guy are not reason enough for the Hall.  with that said, alot of the Hall members from NYC in the 30-50&#039;s should not be there, but that is where the electors were from.

&quot;I&#039;m the goat. I never expected he&#039;d try to score. I couldn&#039;t hear anybody hollering at me above the crowd. I gave (Enos) Slaughter at least six strides with the delay. I know I could have nailed him if I had suspected he would try for the plate. I&#039;m the goat - no doubt about it.&quot; - Johnny Pesky

REPLY - MPC - No doubt he played a sad role in 1946 but he is a lot better player than the Scooter and lost out on his three biggest years]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[papelbon is a baseball oddity.  his peripheral stats with PHI have been terrible, but he continues to save games and get guys out.  i think that proves it&#039;s more of a mentality than elite level stuff, control, etc.  he was always a winner, despite his knuckleheaded ways.  i would gladly welcome him back to boston if it could improve the &#039;pen.

gronk is a total [feminine product].  i love him on the field, but have no use for him off the field.  he&#039;s so chiefy.

i would disagree whether or not NFL will get destroyed in court.  it all depends on how much patriots want to open the cabinets on the whole league.  this is after all a business.

goodell arbitrating brady&#039;s suspension is laughable.

REPLY - MPC - You would like to think Goodell has a plan but hasn&#039;t to this point]]></description>
