		<description><![CDATA[After the Colts dropped a dime on the Pats, the NFL &#038; Walt Anderson STILL lost control of the balls and didn&#039;t feel it necessary to recheck or replace the balls. Shows you how important they thought the air pressure was in the beginning.
Even IF Brady is guilty of something its a first offense and a minor one at that. Punishment does not fit the crime.
Brady&#039;s lawyer&#039;s are going to expose Well&#039;s and the NFL as incompetent boobs.]]></description>
