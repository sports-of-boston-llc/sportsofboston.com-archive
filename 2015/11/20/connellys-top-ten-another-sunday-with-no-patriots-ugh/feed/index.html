		<description><![CDATA[Not bad lists, but DImaggio isn&#039;t even top 10 in baseball. Cy Young, Walter Johnson, Willie Mays, Ty Cobb, Hank Aaron, Tris Speaker, Honus Wagner, Stan Musial, Rogers Hornsby, Eddie Collins, Lou Gehrig, Ted Williams, Rickey Henderson, Mickey Mantle, to name just a few.

REPLY - MPC - Good list - I put Mays over DiMaggio - I have such a tough time with anyone before 1930 - but fair points]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good list, but doesn&#039;t the Rocket have to rank higher than Cam Neely?  Neely never led the league in anything, never won any awards, never made first team all-NHL.  Clemens, on the other hand, won an MVP, three Cy Youngs, and six (!!) ERA titles while wearing the Red Sox uniform.

REPLY - MPC - Yes my hatred for him clouded my judgement]]></description>

REPLY - MPC - Yes, I think Neely was a one in a generation scorer, fighter his 50 goals in 48 games? won&#039;t happen again in this league. Bourque was an A- all the time - Neely was an A+ for five years - ie orr]]></description>
