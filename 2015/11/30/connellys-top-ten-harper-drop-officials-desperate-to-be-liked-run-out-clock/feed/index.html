		<description><![CDATA[the officials caused the gronk injury.  if pats hadn&#039;t been called for the PI, they wouldn&#039;t have been screaming footballs at gronk with 2 minutes left, trying to pick up chunk yardage to end game.

that was another disgraceful game by NFL officials.  it was all over the league turkey day and yesterday.  the product is getting worse.  i am rethinking my commitment to watching as much football as i do every sunday.  there are better things to do when the pats aren&#039;t on.

we are lucky to watch a team such as the pats, though.  the mere fact that a team of scrubs almost pulled out that win, playing their tails off for 4 quarters.  if pats get healthy, they will steamroll in playoffs.

REPLY - MPC - No doubt they don&#039;t throw to Gronk on a seam route if they were already down the field - Belichick has been begging for replay on everything. Why don&#039;t they just make him commissioner and President of the United States - we&#039;d be a lot better off]]></description>
