		<description><![CDATA[&quot;panda&quot;... so infuriating.  i hate that nickname, despise the player more by the day... ugh.

remember the &quot;it&#039;s called bruins&quot; campaign.  well, apparently it&#039;s called bruins means shipping out talented players in the name of a coach that plays for ties and 2-1 shootout losses.  seriously... until they man up and fire claude, the product won&#039;t change on the ice.

REPLY - MPC - Red Sox got their lunch money taken every day - they need a consulting group to come in and do a survey of former Bruins and free agents that won&#039;t come here and ask why]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t like the Rinaldo deal at all, either, but to be fair he had two years remaining on his contract, and Soderberg was a restricted free agent. Not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison.

REPLY - MPC - They can&#039;t draft in the first round never mind the sixth - just give Soderberg away]]></description>
