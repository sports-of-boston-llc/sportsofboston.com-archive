		<description><![CDATA[Good call on Ortiz.  Other than being totally selfish and a malcontent, why does he wait for the first 4 game winning streak with the Yanks in town to be the Sox buzzkill. Try to keep your mouth shut and hit your weight. Put Shaw at first, DeAza in left and DH hanley so Papi can get his well deserved rest. Wonder how Belichik would react to this.

REPLY - MPC - look at what has happened since his whining - Belichick got rid of Seymour as soon as he good]]></description>
