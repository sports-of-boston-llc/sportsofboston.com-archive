		<description><![CDATA[Pedro moment for me, seeing him walk out to the bullpen in game 5 vs. Cleveland in 1999.  Crowd was electric.  Sox getting crushed, but everyone knew Sox would win with Pedro on the mound

Sprite for sure
I think Chuck Cunningham was supposed to be the first spin off, before Laverne and Shirley, Mork and Mindy, Joanie Loves Chacchi

REPLY - MPC - Definitely top 3 moment for Pedro - 1st being Yankee stadium 17 K / All Star game / then Cleveland]]></description>
