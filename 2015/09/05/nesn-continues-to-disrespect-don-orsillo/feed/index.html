		<description><![CDATA[RED SOX NATION ARE THE FANS THAT SUPPORT 
NESN by watching the Red Sox games faithfully and enjoy Don &#038; Jerry tremendously!!!! Why would Tom Werner want to fix something that is not broken!!! I can&#039;t believe that they are not listening to the patrons of NESN THAT 50,000 SIGNATURES DOESN&#039;T MEAN ANYTHING TO THEM!!! What do the sponsors of NESN think when the powers that be do not care what their fan base thinks!!!
It TRULY is MIND BOGGLING!!!!TO THINK
THAT THEY WOULD ASK DON ORSILLO  TO STAND BY THEM AND SAY IT WAS A MUTUAL DECISION??????]]></description>
