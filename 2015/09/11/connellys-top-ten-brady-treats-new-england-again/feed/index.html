		<description><![CDATA[Nothing to do with football at Gillette, But when there are music concerts at Gillette has anyone complained that the sound or Bluetooth was a problem!! The opposition complaining about the Patriots is outrageous.

REPLY - MPC - There was sound problems at a game last week at a college game and there was no complaining]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are 100% correct on Edelman being a big trash talker. I noticed it a few times last year, especially in the SB. But last night it seemed he was yapping EVERY time a pass went his way. Hope no one cleans his clock for it.
It really was head-scratching to see how much time the Steelers (and Roethlisberger) wasted last night at the end of the first half and the end of the game. Definitely brought back memories of the Pats-Eagles SB with Andy Reid and McNabb.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Defensive front 7 did not look as good as I had hoped - but it&#039;s early.  I agree about Butler.  Give him at least a couple of games.  They won&#039;t be facing too many QB&#039;s and teams that throw the ball as well as Pitt.

Collinsworth is such an ass. I used to like him until Deflategate.
Bring on Buffalo.

REPLY - MPC - fair point on Butler / front 7 will get better though Easly could hurt]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The pre-game sucked, there was no real way to tell what was going on because it was clearly mishandled on purpose by the NFL and NBC.

That, coupled with the plant comment about headsets... it&#039;s shaping up to be a real salty year to root for the Pats.  So that&#039;s how the NFL is going to play it this year?  If I&#039;m Kraft, I am suing for the picks today just to irk these jerkwads.

I like Butler&#039;s competitiveness at this stage in his career.  He, at the least, looks better than any scrub they have had in there in the years before Revis and Talib.  Give it time, I say.  I also love the fact that the Pats just left him on an island all night and said go compete.  He got toasted a couple times, no question.  There is talent there.

REPLY - MPC - You know Kraft has been meeting with attorney&#039;s / Butler is skilled and athletic]]></description>
