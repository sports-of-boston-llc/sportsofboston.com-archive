		<description><![CDATA[Absolutely agree that Felger and Mazz played a dangerous game this year.  But, I will still never go back to WEEI.  Ordway is flat-out terrible and doesn&#039;t resonate with me, and I am of the opinion that Minihane is the worst sports personality in town.  Everything he says sounds like nails on a chalkboard.  Lots of yelling and screeching unnecessarily - yes, I am aware that Mazz has a high-pitched shriek himself.  I liken Minihane more to Gresh in that they are generally grating people.

I do like Jerry Thornton and I thought it was weird that 98.5 didn&#039;t utilize him more when they had him.

REPLY - MPC - All three shows on Sports Hub are in the bullpen right now]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[According to one count, 90 of 92 sources in ESPN piece were anonymous. What newspaper would print that? Of course, might not really have been 92 sources, as one of my friends said, how many were Bill Polian?

REPLY - MPC - Bill Pollian add to the haters / amazing for so many quotes without names- Grantland Rice must be rolling in grave]]></description>
