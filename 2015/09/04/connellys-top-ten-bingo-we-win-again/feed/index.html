		<description><![CDATA[If state governments are dumb enough to give someone $75M for anything, especially video games, that&#039;s on them and the idiots who elect them. If it&#039;s a great product hedge funds will invest. Governments need to stay out of the private sector. 
As for radical Islamist and Muslims, Schilling is right. Nazi&#039;s tried to cleanse a race of people and Jihadist are doing the same thing. ESPN is wrong..... again. 

REPLY - MPC - Same page]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t say Schilling couldn&#039;t comment.  I said he shouldn&#039;t tweet dumb nonsense.

I&#039;m undecided on ISIS relevance.  I&#039;m hesitant to say that they are really a force to be reckoned with.  Their land grabs have been focused on oil... meaning they need resources to continue to gain power.  I never said we shouldn&#039;t do anything about them, though.

Also, I was talking about extremists over the last 30 years.  Schill never mentioned ISIS in his tweet, he generalized.  ISIS is one of the first groups to attempt to establish a so-called &quot;caliphate&quot;.  If he wanted to discuss ISIS, that&#039;s what he should have talked about.  I don&#039;t really think he was interested in having a dialogue, though.  He just wanted to troll people.

REPLY - MPC - Problem I see with ISIS is momentum, money and organized]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On point #9: We really have been extremely fortunate to have had Cusick/Peirson for Bruins TV, Wilson for Bruins radio, Most for Celtics radio, Santos/Gino for Pats radio, Ned Martin/Jim Martin for Sox radio, Gowdy for Sox TV. I also loved when Hawk Harrelson was doing color for the Sox TV crew, as well as any and every time the Eck does Sox TV.

REPLY - MPC - I agree no city can boast the talent behind the microphone as Boston and I agree the Hawk was and is good (put it on the board!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agree with tron above... Michael Hurley should get his own Sports Department at this point. His very first article on the subject brought up issues that Berman ruled on. 
I&#039;ll admit, I thought he was just homer-ing, but dang if he was being impartial, insightful, and... Right. On. The. Money.

REPLY - MPC - All good points]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, lots to digest here...

I&#039;ll start by actually making a point about football, not the &quot;deflated ball situation&quot; - I&#039;m not calling it a -Gate, anymore.  The idea that Brady hasn&#039;t had a lot of weapons over the years, I believe, should morph to very specific years when the Pats screwed him - such as &#039;06 and &#039;12.  They have been more sneaky talented throughout the years than people give them credit for.  Also, for the past 5, he&#039;s basically working with the most evolutionary player not named JJ Watt in all of football, and a player that could arguably go down as one of the top 3 players at his position, ever.  Just a point.  I generally agree they have screwed him in some specific years and that other QBs have been catered to far more than Brady ever has.  I am glad for that, though.  I think that approach has benefited the team and Brady himself.  He never can stop working and is always relentless.

On Point 3, I think you missed the most critical member of the media - Michael Hurley of CBSBoston.  From the jump, Hurley was all over the sham of the NFL and the fact that the process was a kangaroo court.  He went up against Felger and Mazz multiple times and always came out with his head high and never sunk to their level and today he&#039;s pretty vindicated, I would say.

What do you say to those that argue the judge vacated the suspension based on process and basically, in his written ruling, murkily stated he accepted that Brady did something if Goodell says he did?  I tell them to suck it, but it&#039;s still something that will always linger.  I am glad the judge wrote his opinion in that fashion because I think there is 0 chance the NFL appeal wins - the ruling is airtight.  Berman slammed the NFL for 39.5 pages.

Count me as one of the many that view Carter&#039;s comments as far more combustible than Schilling, and I agree that it&#039;s hypocritical.  However, what Schilling said was far from cogent... it was just troll speech.  That he clearly didn&#039;t believe in because he took it down quite quickly.  It was silly nonsense.  There is no comparable between extremist Muslims and the Nazis beyond their hatred of others.  Extremists operate in shadows, Nazis were fanatical record keepers.  Nazis took advantage of a weakened super power to brainwash an entire populace.  Extremists operate in pockets throughout the globe.  He was way off base and uninformed.  It&#039;s a pretty good idea if you almost bankrupted a state economy because you wanted to play video games and eat pizza to probably not tweet Hitler, anyways - call me crazy.

REPLY - MPC - Good effort on your points - first of all I think you are understating isis as being in the shadows they are moving through the middle east toward Turkey right in front of everyone and identifying people and groups that are different and massacreing them - see how Nazi Germany started and starting picking away at morals and then the Rhineland and then ..... / Also I think its unfair of you to say because Schilling screwed up in Rhode Island that he has lost the freedom to comment / Check out all pro appearance by Brady weapons and those QB weapons - Gronk has only been available for 65% of those games / Good point on Hurley - he made a name for himself for being on the wall although I think Felger got the better of him on one appearance / Ultimately the judge&#039;s ruling was brilliant and written in anticipation of the appeal - wasn&#039;t his job to discuss footballs but instead process -]]></description>
