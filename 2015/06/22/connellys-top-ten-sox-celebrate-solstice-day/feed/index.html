		<description><![CDATA[Boggs and Jeter hitting HR in 3000th hit is more fluky than having anything to do with steriod era in my opinion. Better example is Shawn Green hit 42 Hrs with 123 RBIs. hit 309, won a Gold Glove and that was only good for 9th in MVP voting in 1999! Or always remember this one, Chipper Jones knocked in 100 runs 7 straight years from 96 to &#039;02 and in none of those years did he manage to crack top 10 in NL in RBIs (he did have 100 next year for 8th straight season and finally finished 9th)

REPLY - MPC - HE swears that he never used because he didn&#039;t want to disappoint his father]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Three things
1) why haven&#039;t we embraced Diva_legacy as a good luck charm? Sox 3-1 since she was contacted by Panda.  Let her throw out first pitch, can&#039;t hurt.
2) TIGER JUICED!!! yup, 100%, he juiced and pulled the rug over all of us.  Steroid guy, wife cheater narcisitic, glad he is done.  Just look at the numbers, the juicing doesn&#039;t lie.
3) $40 million for Upton, WOW, and she ruined Verlander while at it

REPLY - MPC -No doubt Tiger Juiced but I bet 35-40% of the tour does just to keep up with him. Rory hits the ball farther than Nicklaus did / good idea on diva legacy like Pedro&#039;s little friend]]></description>
