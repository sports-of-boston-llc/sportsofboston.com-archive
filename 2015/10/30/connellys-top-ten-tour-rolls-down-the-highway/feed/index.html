		<description><![CDATA[The folks at Toucher and Rich are a joke.  The problem is with Kirk Minnihan on the other station morning drive time is tough.

REPLY - MPC - things getting personal now - I think Minihane is brilliant but the lack of filter means he should be on Sirius radio]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On #6, Edelman - what is his percentage of drops compared to others? He get&#039;s the ball a lot so I bet he&#039;s also near thew top for completions so I think that percentage is more relevant than the actual number

REPLY - MPC - fair point 9.3% is his ratio which is - which is 10th highest for receivers targeted over 20 times]]></description>
