		<description><![CDATA[&quot; Long article in Globe Sports on Friday about Marshfield player Danny Dalton going to Penn State after committing to Boston College. Not one word about his responsibility to his word and what commitment means&quot;

REPLY - MPC - No one stopped in editors office and said this kid is just another spoiled athlete who wants what he wants when he wants it]]></description>
