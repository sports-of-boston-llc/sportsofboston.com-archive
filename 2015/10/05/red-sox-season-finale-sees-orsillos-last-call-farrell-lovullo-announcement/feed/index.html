		<description><![CDATA[It was a sad situation to watch Don Orsillo call his last game for THE BOSTON RED SOX. He had such loyal fans who loved and respected him.
The tip of their caps by the RED SOX TEAM to DON was very touching and a class act. It was, also, very difficult for Jerry Remy to end this partnership that no one can top.
Best Wishes to Don as the voice of THE SAN DIEGO PADRES
It was indeed a sad ending to the RED SOX season.]]></description>
