		<description><![CDATA[Never been to Cooperstown?  It is a great take, try and go for Induction Weekend.  It is crowded, but it is an amazing take.  You&#039;ll need to book a motel close to the Village over a year in advance and pay a little more, but well worth it to be able to walk to the Hall and then get to all the events.  Was so fun to see random HOF players just out walking around or eating lunch, most were very friendly.  The Parade the night before the induction ceremony was the best.  Paul Molitor is always amazing, stops and signs for everyone, Wade Boggs?  Not so much.

REPLY - MPC - I have lucky enough to be there several times - not for induction week - will re-visit thanks!]]></description>
