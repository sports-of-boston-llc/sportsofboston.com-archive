		<description><![CDATA[Love the random name, especially as a great second baseman that Doug was. I still have his baseball card.  Wondering what someone like him or Hank Finkel are up to now, would make an interesting 30 for 30, &quot;where are they now, the non-famous&quot;
Scorcese is over-rated when looking at all his movies, he had a few GREAT ones, then the rest are CRAP

REPLY - MPC - I agree Scorcese was hot but then became a caricature of himself]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with you guys on Departed.  How about Martin Scorcese is just overrated all the way around?

REPLY - MPC - Gotta give him some love but big picture not even in top 20 of directors]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[-MPC, spot on.  &quot;The Departed&quot; is fascinating in how bad a movie it is.  The acting is pathetic.  The sets looked fake (Damon&#039;s view from his condo of the Statehouse was unbelievably bad); upon walking out of his graduation ceremony, as if a Statie in full uniform would climb in the back seat of the biggest mobster in the State&#039;s car?; Martin Sheen gets tossed off a building and it looks like someone throws a cup of blood in Dicaprio&#039;s face--amateur special effects, similarly 3rd grade level symbolism of rat crawling on the balcony railing of Damon&#039;s condo after he gets whacked.  People love that movie and I can&#039;t fathom why.

REPLY - MPC - It was the cast, the song, Boston edgy but a cinematic mess]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank God for Chris Mintz, Pat Tillman, Marcus Lutrell, Carlos Arredondo and those countless others who rush to danger or put themselves in harms way. It&#039;s folks like them that make our country great! Not the Kardashians, Clintons or countless other narcissistic clowns.

REPLY - MPC - Amen brother!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How was that bad form to drill Arrieta?  He hit 2 guys... and was trying to establish plate close to hitters in doing so.  He wasn&#039;t malicious for it, but he certainly wasn&#039;t apologetic.  I think it&#039;s fine, wasn&#039;t a dangerous pitch or anything.  That nutcase Rodriguez was the only one out of line, I think.

It is going to be a long season for the Bs.  Despicable how quickly they have fallen back to mediocrity.

REPLY - MPC - Lucky to be 500]]></description>
