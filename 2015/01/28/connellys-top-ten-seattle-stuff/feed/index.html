		<description><![CDATA[of all the zany analysis that people have said since the game was set... the strangest thing to me is that people believe the pats will be able to run on the hawks D.  i know that GB ran on the hawks, but blount is NOT eddie lacy.  blount can&#039;t run out of the shotgun and pistol formations like lacy did.  when the pats get him going, it&#039;s out of i-formation, 6-linemen sets, 2 TE sets, etc.  the hawks will eat those formations alive.

believe me... i know that they HAVE to try this in the gameplan, as it will limit SEA O time on the field if the pats can get running AND it will wear down LoB and the linebackers, but i expect SEA to put up more of a fight than the colts.

it&#039;s interesting to me, because the pats didn&#039;t even bother trying to run against BALT bc they were so bad against the pass, but SEA is versatile everywhere.  how do you attack that D most effectively?

REPLY - MPC - Use Seattle&#039;s aggressiveness and speed against them - cut backs / counter plays / end arounds to Edleman]]></description>
