		<description><![CDATA[I kind of get what you&#039;re saying about the 12th man thing, but look at the luxury seats at Gillette for most of the game...they&#039;re empty.

I know you&#039;ve mentioned it a bunch of times before as well.  It would be nice to see everyone there to watch a football game as opposed to being there to be rubbing elbows with the other &quot;swells&quot;.

REPLY - MPC - Great point! you are completely right. Patriot organization sold out for money instead of almost demanding a culture of in your seats bar is closed, fireplaces are turned off]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You have apparently stripped Wade Boggs of the 1983 American League batting championship.  He hit .361 that year, including .404 in the month of July.

Boggs and his wife Debbie will celebrate their 39th wedding anniversary this year!

REPLY - MPC - That year he tested positive for Miller Life and chicken and Margo so he&#039;s out! Debbie and Hillary]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[LOL on Shula, just shut up, Don. 
Thanks for Yaz 67 reference. Keeping in mind what was at stake and that was the high-mound, dead-ball era, that may have been the best month of them all.

REPLY - MPC - Greatest individual season in Boston sports history]]></description>
