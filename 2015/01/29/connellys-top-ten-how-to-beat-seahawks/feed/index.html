		<description><![CDATA[I have listened to 98.5 since the first day it launched.  typically, I enjoy the contrarian views of felger as I think it&#039;s fun and good to hear a different viewpoint.  it also helped 98.5 that WEEI&#039;s programming was (and still is, by the way) laughable at the time - most notably the morning and afternoon drive shows.  no one really has strong opinions about any midday show, right?

HOWEVER - in my opinion, 98.5 is doing a disservice to itself in allowing felger and mazz to run the program in their current fashion.  it is essentially a 4-hour rant against the premiere sports organizations in boston, and focuses most hate on the pats whose games are broadcast on THEIR station.  they are free to express their opinions, but I am also free to continue my present boycott of portions of their show.

I will say, any year they go to the super bowl, they have had mad dog on.  I still didn&#039;t agree with them letting him rip the pats for as long as he did.  they also gave a platform to El Prez, who killed them for 15 minutes.  they do try and acknowledge their opposition.

I think the mistake has been they focused on creating hype and &quot;hot takes&quot; and missed the mark.  they will absolutely look disingenuous when / if the pats pull it off on Sunday and they open Mondays show praising them.

REPLY - MPC - Good points]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I remember telling you when we first met that I couldn&#039;t stand Felger because of exactly that reason. He&#039;s a smug, arrogant, condescending puke. The first time the Patriots went to the super bowl in 01/02 season, he spent every pre game discussion explaining why it was over and they would be exposed. He would spend every post game discussion rolling his eyes explaining that it was a fluke and their luck will run out next game. 

I&#039;m not a fan boy who needs my team defended at all costs, but if you can&#039;t recognize a great feel good story and give credit to a hard working, well prepared team then go somewhere else. That season is what sports is all about - especially after 9/11. They overcame the adversity of losing their franchise quarterback and rode the young guy to a championship. They chose to enter as a team - now it&#039;s become common. Remember having to deal with Ray Lewis&#039;s dance?

I can&#039;t listen to him and am always surprised that people do.

REPLY - MPC - You have been against him since beginning - I think he provides a perspective but now its a sincere attack against a team that has accomplished more than his Green Bay Packers]]></description>
