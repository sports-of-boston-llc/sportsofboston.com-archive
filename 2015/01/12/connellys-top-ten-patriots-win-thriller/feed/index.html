		<description><![CDATA[Taking a safety would have been a bad idea. Turned it into 2 point game. Ravens could used &quot;fair catch kick&quot; to beat them by a point. Obscure rule, but sure was in Bill&#039;s head http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_catch_kick   Much better odds to punt at that point and defend a hail mary. However, I thought Brady could have danced around a few seconds or ran towards sidelins and give self up before going out of bounds on 1st, 2nd, and 3rd down, it was insane they ended up punting and having to defend hail marry.

I think if the punt was far enough away even using that rule would have been too far - either way we&#039;re on the same page - they messed that up]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wasn&#039;t that Amendola with the catch and stretch for a 1st down..not Edleman? 

Amendola has been an overall disappointment in his time in NE but he has come up big in a few games down the stretch this year...

REPLY - MPC - you are correct my bad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Where was Jonas Gray? He is the best running back on this team. He needs to be playing on most running plays. I am disgusted in the fact he is in the doghouse

REPLY - MPC - I heard there is more things than an oversleep]]></description>
