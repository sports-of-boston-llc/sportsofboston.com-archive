		<description><![CDATA[In the next few weeks. The identity of this NFL leaker. The motivation and reason he seems to have lied to or given incomplete info to media outlets is a bigger scandal than deflategate. In think the NFL will be firing people long before Mr. Kraft will be. I also can see several media personalities suspended. The haters are on cloud 9 right now. But reality is about to slap them in the face. Which is what men used to do to hysterical women.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you Steve for a wonderful article. I agree with every word you said. This has definitely been a media circus, they were judge, jury and if they could be the executioner. Unfortunately, in my opinion, if the Patriots win, in the eyes of the media and everyone they brought to their dark side, it will be because they &quot;cheated&quot; their way to the Superbowl and if they lose, it will be because they couldn&#039;t cheat. So sad for the true fans of football and what should definitely be the best superbowl with the two top teams in the NFL.]]></description>
