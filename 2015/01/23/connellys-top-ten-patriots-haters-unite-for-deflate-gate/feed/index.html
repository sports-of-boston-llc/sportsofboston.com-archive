		<description><![CDATA[I like your list of people happy about this deflation situation, but I would put Ron FORGEs higher.  He was downright gleeful yesterday during the Brady presser, and his twitter feed is a constant rant against the Patriots, regardless of controversy or success.

saw whiplash based on your statement that it gets best picture oscar in your mind.  loved it, just a tad better than american sniper.  it&#039;s easily in the A / A- range, whereas some parts of sniper move it down a hair.  still have 6 of the best picture nominees to see, though.

reply-mpc - this is Christmas for the patriot haters / Boyhood (which was clever not better) I would go with Whiplash, Imitation Game, American Sniper, Citizen Four, Wild, Birdman in that order]]></description>
