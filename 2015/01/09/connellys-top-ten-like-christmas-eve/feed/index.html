		<description><![CDATA[Mike, I just looked this up. Dwight Evans hit 94 homers in a five-year stretch in his late 20s, and then hit 137 in five years in his early 30s. That&#039;s a difference of 41. Biggio&#039;s spike of 55 in his early 30s is more dramatic, for sure, but HR spikes are not unusual for players in their early 30s, usually with lower BA and higher BB rates. I am not saying Biggio didn&#039;t use, but without more evidence it might not be fair to speculate.

REPLY - MPC - Good points]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, many, many players used PEDs during Biggio&#039;s career, and Biggio may have as well. But the circumstantial evidence you cite is unconvincing. Biggio moved from the pitching friendly Astrodome to the bandbox Enron Field in 2000 at age 35. He went from averaging about 12 HR a year to about 20 a year with that switch. It is also typical for players to generate more power as they age. Check Dwight Evans&#039; career, and nobody accused him of PED use.

REPLY - MPC - I think your comments are fair I will offer though - first five years at Astrodome 30 home runs / last five years at Astrodome 85 home runs]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kars4kids is in a class all its own in terms of annoying commercials.  I also question whether it is really a legitimate charity.

&quot;Dallas has never recovered from 11/22/63&quot;?  What does that mean?

REPLY - MPC - When I think of Dallas I think of three things - oil, Cowboys and hosting the Kennedy killing]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I almost always agree with you on your randomocity points, but I like the Icky shuffle commercial...&quot;I&#039;m going to get me some cold cuts today!!&quot;

For some reason I think it&#039;s funny - although I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a good add because until you wrote that it&#039;s for Geico I had forgotten that&#039;s what is was for.

REPLY - MPC - Just googled Ickey - lost his 16 year old son to an asthma attack and has started a foundation - maybe this is a nice source of cash flow that he is using for good. My question is the three second rule in effect - the cold cuts are on the floor]]></description>
