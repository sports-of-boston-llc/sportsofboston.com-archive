		<description><![CDATA[Speaking of smarts, Seattle also has a player from top NE liberal arts college Middlebury, the kicker. Good guy, too, and really rare to see a NESCAC player in the NFL, never mind the Super Bowl two years in a row. He used to kick against Tufts and Amherst.

The pitchers Sox traded won&#039;t amount to much, look at their Major League numbers. Sox kept the better prospects, Owens, Escobar, et al.

REPLY - MPC - Did they get enough for their investment - yes they protected their three lefties but still seems like the Texas lefty wasn&#039;t enough]]></description>
