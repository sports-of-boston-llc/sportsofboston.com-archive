		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Brendan&#039;s synopsis of the 
paragraph that states &quot;The Red Sox coaching staff shares some of the blame for today&#039;s loss----- Every point made is on point. It&#039;s a shame that the Red Sox couldn&#039;t win this one after making a great comeback! I was hoping that they could change the stat report of being 0-55 when they are behind in the 8th inning!]]></description>
