		<description><![CDATA[I feel the need to add a comment on the departure of Don Orsillo. I recently heard that Red Sox Nation had 50,000 
signatures for a petition to keep Don 
Orsillo on NESN.I haven&#039;t heard that NESN responded to that petition.What does it take for them to reconsider their position on Mr. Orsillo???
What if the fans did not support their 
sponsors,how do the sponsors feel about this decision???? Also, NESN needs to take in account all the phone calls they received on changing this decision!!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s hard to believe that NESN let go 
their top play by play announcer and top personality Don Orsillo. My husband and I love  Don and Jerry,they are so compatible, and make the game so interesting and comedic by their funny comments to each other. EVEN,when the Red SOX were loosing most nights, we enjoyed listening to them. We were always disappointed when one of them was not there.NOW, the Red Sox games have been exciting to watch and we hear this sad news about Don.
NESN is making a big mistake letting Don go!!! I wish Don all the best,and 
know he will definitely be picked up by another network!]]></description>
