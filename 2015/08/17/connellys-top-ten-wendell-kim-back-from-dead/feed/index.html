		<description><![CDATA[Matt G is correct.  There is no scientific evidence to suggest that Adderall is a masking agent whatsoever for steroids.

However - a few quick google searches took me to many steroid juicing forums in which these meatheads talk about using Adderall in conjunction with their &quot;cycles&quot; to curb appetite, increase focus and stamina, and support their efforts to tone their bodies.

I think at its most base, MPC&#039;s 1st comment was about a clear link between Adderall and steroids.  After about 3 minutes on the internet, and the mountains of posts I found... there&#039;s enough to intrigue me.

Davis was a nobody for a few years and then exploded onto the scene in the new &quot;dead ball&quot; era with ridiculous HR and RBI numbers for 2 seasons.  Hard to sit here and say he did it on the up-and-up, after everything we have seen in the last 15 years.  It&#039;s speculative, certainly.  He did get a legal exemption from MLB this year for another ADHD drug, Vyvanse.

Also, it&#039;s definitely fair to include Papi in any speculation, however I might feel about him.  Grateful for what the team has done with him on it and all that, but he&#039;s dirty in my opinion.  Just that - opinion.

		<description><![CDATA[Are you saying taking Adderall could hide a positive test for steroids? I couldn&#039;t find that on a google search. NFL players can claim they got suspended for taking Adderall w/o a prescription, when in fact they tested positive for steroids, but I don&#039;t believe that is what happened with Davis. I could be wrong, but would love to read about the science behind hiding steroid use by taking Adderall. He got a 25 game suspension, would have been 50 if was steroids.

rEPLY - MPC - I just googled Adderall masking steroids and multiple articles came right up]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Adderall is a performance-enhancing drug for adults banned by virtually every professional sports league. See Seattle, NFL, the real cheaters. Juicing, as Michael suggested, is juicing. Including Papi might be unfair, however; evidence is scant there.

REPLY - MPC - Thanks for the support on first point - but are you saying Papi hasn&#039;t had a surge and its not a little suspicious and that the surge has included three 450 foot home runs - also what is your take on the leaked name for positive drug tests?]]></description>
