		<description><![CDATA[Agree with tron on Felger and Mazz, thank goodness we are a two sports radio station town.  Mornings I cant do 98.5 because they are CLOWNS.
Some great names thrown around today, Andy Marte #1 prospect in the world when we got him and Willy Mo (wow).  Makes me want to trade any minor leaguer when they are HOT and RANKED, remember LARS Anderson, probably could have got a bunch for him at his peak

REPLY - MPC - I presume that these young GM&#039;s and all their excel spread sheets do forensics on old trades and see that prospects don&#039;t pan out 70% of the time thus trade them]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am very disappointed in the depths to which Felger &#038; Mazz have sunk to keep their show relevant.  Trolling Pats fans constantly, running basically a 4-hour anti-Patriots themed afternoon drive just to generate angst and venom from callers.

And then Mazz comes out of left field with the &quot;pharmacist&quot; stuff this week on his return.  I&#039;m not saying he could be wrong, but I just feel that it was unnecessary to put that on air other than to get people going.

It&#039;s a shame.

REPLY - MPC - ITs crazy that a show like F&#038;M can now just throw out things with no back up or foundation - come to the table with at least I&#039;ve talked to sources and they are telling me....]]></description>
