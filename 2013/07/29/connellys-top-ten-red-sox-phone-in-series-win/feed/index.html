		<description><![CDATA[i certainly don&#039;t want them to be there for 8 seasons, but everyone should be rooting for the Cs to be horrible the next 2 years.  if they end up 40-42 and an 8 seed, it is without question worse than sucking full-time and getting a high draft pick.

agree on papi.  that flipout was an all-timer and a low moment.  he should certainly be grateful the club brought in guys like napoli and gomes, who easily made light of the situation yesterday.

REPLY - MPC - Ortiz is a selfish guy - evidence is there / Celts could be ugly but I&#039;m predicting 40 wins]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nick O&#039;Leary is lucky he didn&#039;t get seriously hurt or killed. 

Agree about adding the 5th infielder, especially when you have speed on second (Ichiro). Any ball in the outfield, he&#039;ll score easily. 

Not only is Maddon doing a solid job, the Rays&#039; front office is one of the best in the game. Great trades, pickups, etc. 

Prediction for tonight: Lavarnway goes deep! 

Iglesias not hitting and not drawing any walks. He has returned to earth, but his glove is top notch. 

I have mixed feelings about Drew. Solid glove at short. I think his bat will get cranking. Just a hunch. 

Not sure about Nava moving forward.

REPLY - MPC - Iglesias love the trade high value / Lavarnway I will hold on that prediction / crazy motor cycle accident]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[* I would have traded Stephen Drew when he stepped on home plate with his second home run Saturday
* Inglesias is hitting .208 in July

Um, maybe you don&#039;t do the first thing because of the second thing? Iglesias is coming back to earth fast, Drew might well be a better option at SS for the rest of the season, with Bogaerts at 3B.

Also it is weird to see Fox backing soccer so big because of the political angle: Hugely popular sport for immigrants, and the in the bigger picture Fox ownership is not too immigrant-friendly.

REPLY - MPC - Kids in Connecticut love soccer]]></description>
