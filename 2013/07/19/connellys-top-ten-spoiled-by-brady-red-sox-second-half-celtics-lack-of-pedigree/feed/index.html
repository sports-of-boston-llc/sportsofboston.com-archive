		<description><![CDATA[MPC,

Crain from the White Sox? Tigers are in the hunt for a closer as well. Dombrowski(Detroit GM) one of the best when it comes to adding pieces to his team in late July. 

Tazawa concerns me. Looks like a different pitcher lately.

REPLY - MPC - Dombroski has done a great job ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No on Papelbon. Watched him pitched vs the White Sox, and he didn&#039;t get above 92 mph on his fastball. His best years are behind him. 

Will Buchholz throw another pitch this year? I&#039;m thinking Boston grabs another starter and a bullpen arm (righty)and a backup infielder come trading deadline. 

Marty Barrett also made the last out in the 1986 World Series. 

Vermontk explained what you need to know about Rivera. It&#039;s just that simple. Leyland did the right thing. 

Johnny Football will not last the entire season.He&#039;ll take too many hits. He will get hurt. Guaranteed! You heard it hear first.

REPLY - MPC - Johnny Football might not get out of the tailgates / good point on Barrett last at bat - I can still see Orosco throwing his glove in the air / Interesting on Papelbon - then who?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Michael, if Rivera doesn&#039;t pitch 8th, NL takes the lead in the bottom of the inning, AL gets shut down in the top of the 9th, Rivera never pitches in New York in his final all-star appearance. That&#039;s why Leyland played it safe and put No. 42 in for the 8th inning. Also allowed for the empty field run-in after Neil Diamond. It was done right. 
Also, I wouldn&#039;t touch Papelbon and his declining K rate and inability to protect one-run leads - look it up - with a barge pole. 
Like the Lester-Garza deal, though.

REPLY - MPC - Good help on Rivera]]></description>
