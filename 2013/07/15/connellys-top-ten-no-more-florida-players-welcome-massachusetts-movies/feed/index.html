		<description><![CDATA[Fever Pitch didn&#039;t even get an honorable mention? Please explain. Jimmy Fallon never more charming; Fenway Park never more beautiful; the passion of Boston for baseball and the euphoria of winning never more convincingly presented.

REPLY - MPC - Absolutely not because they sold out the celebration of the World Series by filming a movie during it]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agree but Farrell but Tito is doing a solid job with the Tribe. 

Thornton at this stage is a lefty specialist, he shouldn&#039;t be facing righties. 

It sounds like Aceves&#039; days are coming to a close in Boston. Solid 2011 but a headache since then. 

Timlin was a rock for a couple of years in Boston. Had a long career coming out of the bullpen. 

Belichick will have a &quot;us&quot; against the world mentality. 

Patriots&#039; issues over the years: lack of a pass rush, 3rd down defense, and protecting Brady. Brady won Super Bowls with no stars at wide receiver.

REPLY - MPC - Troy Brown, David Patten and David Givens is better than this group / Timlin great Theo pick up along with Ortiz, Millar, Mueller]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Completely agree with #2, having Kraft bring the whole team in - they should all start community service immediately and have curfews. It&#039;s more clear now why Tim Tebow was brought in. And get a chaperone for Gronk

REPLY - MPC -I could see Gronk hurting himself sneaking out the window]]></description>
