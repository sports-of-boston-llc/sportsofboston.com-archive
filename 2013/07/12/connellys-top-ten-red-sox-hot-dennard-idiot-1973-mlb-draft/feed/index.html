		<description><![CDATA[Rabbit Maranville, Mark Belanger, Stuffy McInnes, Jeff Bagwell, Fred Tenney, Pie Traynor all born in MA, all played more games in the majors than Richie Hebner. I may have missed a few more.

REPLY - MPC - As I stated before - I took from Massachusetts list on Baseball Reference.com - must have sorted list wrong]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that the parade like escort of Whitey Bulger and the Marathon bomber in and out of the courthouse downtown has caused a ton of delays as well.  Traffic is insane!
I don&#039;t care if M&#038;Ms are boring - they&#039;re wicked good.
Psyched to see the post today.

REPLY - MPC - Good point on traffic - city has been turned upside down]]></description>
