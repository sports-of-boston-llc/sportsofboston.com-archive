		<description><![CDATA[TB has a terrible lineup? Are you serious? 

Toronto..most complete team? No way. Their pitching is suspect. 

If the Orioles got a solid starter, I&#039;ll go with them as division champs. If they don&#039;t, TB wins that division.

REPLY - MPC - Lot of holes in that lineup and they are getting it done]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fans need to help out Pedroia and make sure Stewart doesn&#039;t make that catch. 

Poor baserunning by the Red Sox on Saturday and it cost them a game. 

Put a fork in the Yankees, they&#039;re done. NY has a lineup of outs. Cano is the only real threat. Girardi doing a good job. 

Sabathia looked 40 years old last night. Throwing meatballs. 

AL East is a three team race. TB is the most complete team among the three.

REPLY - MPC - I think Tampa has a terrible lineup - Toronto most complete unless Baltimore goes and gets a #2 / good point - imagine a fan could bat that ball away]]></description>
