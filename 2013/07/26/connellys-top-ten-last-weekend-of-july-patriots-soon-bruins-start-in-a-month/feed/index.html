		<description><![CDATA[Raise your hand if you thought Lackey would be this good? Amazing year and I thought he would win maybe 12 games and have an era of 4+. 

Kuroda looked sharp vs Boston last Saturday and shutout the Rangers yesterday in Texas. 

Chuck Finley once traded for Coco Crisp. He had a crazy wife back in the day. 

Sabathia has a chance to win 300 games. 

Underrated Boston pitcher: Bruce Hurst. 

Matt Young scared to throw the ball to first and would underhand the ball to home. 

I don&#039;t see any ARod in LeBron.

REPLY - MPC - I think their is some fake looking the part by Lebron - Matt Young must wake up in cold sweats / Bruce Hurst great 86 postseason / LAckey gets in shape now? No on Sabathia he is depreciating - his pitching in Milwaukee old school]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[They were chanting &quot;just say no&quot; to Canceso in the &#039;88 playoffs at Fenway as well. Always think about that when people say that fans didn&#039;t know or talk about steriods until after McGwire and Sosa in late 90&#039;s.

REPLY - MPC - This is a forty year issue - look at the 70&#039;s STeelers line they are all dead or many of them]]></description>
