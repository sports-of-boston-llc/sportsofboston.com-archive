		<description><![CDATA[* Glad to see you gave Tuukka some love (finally!).  I think his stick save in OT on Lupul has gone under the radar.
* I thought Lucic was great all series, but he was an animal in the 3rd period.  His periods of apparent hibernation are infuriating, but this series showed why the Bruins are in no rush to trade him.  When right, he has a unique combination of size, speed, skill, &#038; anger. Tough to get equal value for that.
* Obvious but Chara carried the defense.
* Krejci is the most under-appreciated athlete in Boston when you look at his post-season play for his entire career.
* Everyone says they knew the B&#039;s would win when get when it went to OT.  Not me. I must admit when Perverly couldn&#039;t settle a bouncing puck in the slot with 10-seconds left in regulation, I thought that was an omen that they had let the opportunity pass.  Happy to be wrong (again!).
* Dave Goucher, who is 10-times better than Jack Edwards, had a great call of Bergeron&#039;s winning goal on radio.]]></description>
