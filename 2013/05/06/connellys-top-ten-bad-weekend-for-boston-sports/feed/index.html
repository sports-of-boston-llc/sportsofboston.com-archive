		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m getting tired of some aspects of the &quot;Patriot way&quot;.  If the Pats get an actual deep-threat, expand the field WR that says &quot;give me the damn ball&quot;, i&#039;m fine with that.  the dink-and-dunk is not working anymore, particularly in crucial close and late situations.

the key for the sox will be to continue to get strong pitching / health.  also, pedroia... no HRs out of 3rd spot?  yikes.

not worried on Bs yet.  I didn&#039;t think any of those goals were Rask&#039;s fault... let&#039;s also not forget that absurd scrum in which Rask made a save with his a$$!  the problem the other night... as is problem on most given nights... they CANT score!  they routinely whip shots wide and high of the net (seguin is most egregious).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Aaron Dobson will make a big impact on NE in 2013 and beyond. 

Will Doubront make it through the entire year? 

Orioles are the team to beat in the AL East. 

Astros are pathetic. Worst baseball team I have ever seen (I&#039;m 41). 

Time for Ainge to tear it down. Will Doc hang around for the rebuilding of the green? 

Send KG to the Clippers. 

Back-up point guards for Ainge is shortstops for the Red Sox.]]></description>
