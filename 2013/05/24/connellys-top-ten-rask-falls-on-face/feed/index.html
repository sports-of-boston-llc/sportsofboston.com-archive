		<description><![CDATA[D Lowe is not even close to boston hall of fame.  he was a mediocre pitcher who had some great games, but boozed too much.  As a reliever, just recall that D-lowe look, when the ball would be hit for a HR

REPLY - MPC - 3.72 ERA / no hitter / had all three clinching wins in 2004 / 85 saves - 70 wins / 2.157 strike out to walks / only pitchers ahead of him on basebareference.com for win probability added - Clemens, Pedro, Papelbon, Kinder, Tiant, Parnell, Stanley Radatz]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Would like to think the dog wasn&#039;t planted and the train was unrelated to Boston, Orlando and London. But by you bringing up the question shows how little we can trust those who tell us the news. The &quot;Fourth Estate&quot; has turned into a leftist propaganda machine. 
The &quot;rule of law&quot; and God is needed more than ever in this great country. 
God Bless all those who served and their families. For they truly are what makes this country great! Sacrificing of themselves to make it better for someone else. 
And Pedro has to be the best pitcher EVER! 
Thank You Michael once again for your column.]]></description>

No way the old lady dog thing was fake, the donkey reporter and cameraman watched the 80 year old lady dig the dog out herself.  If it was planned, they would have helped instead of acting like douchebags.]]></description>
