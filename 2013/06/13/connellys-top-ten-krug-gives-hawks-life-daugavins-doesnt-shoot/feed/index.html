		<description><![CDATA[-Do people need to give back their &quot;Krug Life&quot; t-shirts?
-Great Chicago crowd.
-2 pinball goals by Hawks doesn&#039;t shake my confidence in Rask.
-Does Jagr&#039;s facial hair make anyone think John Wensink?  
-Agreed, too many icings and too many Rask tie ups.  
-I don&#039;t like that Chicago and the Hawks (other than Shaw) are hard to hate. 
-Nava on pace for 90 RBIs (trade him). By the way, compare his stats to whiner Carl Crawford right now. Crawford makes $19.4 mill. more per year.

REPLY - MPC - good comparison point on Crawford / Krug won&#039;t be on the big roster next fall]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i&#039;ve been in agreement with pierre on seguin... but who knows.  maybe he&#039;s about as far away as that non-planet planet pluto.  he missed 3 golden opportunities to just end the game and put a mark on the series already.  it&#039;s disappointing considering the hype and $$$.

chris kelly has been horrible.  doesn&#039;t have a single point in the postseason.  if they had anyone else besides caron or soderberg, i would imagine we would be seeing them.  still has like 2 more years or something, too.]]></description>
