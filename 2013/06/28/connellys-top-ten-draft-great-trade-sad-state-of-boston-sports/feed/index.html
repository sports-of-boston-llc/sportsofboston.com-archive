		<description><![CDATA[How come these whispers were out there on Hernandez but no media member spoke up? 
Media was deaf, dumb and blind when it came to Manny &#038; Sandusky!

REPLY - MPC - Sandusky is a great example of these frauds that don&#039;t have the guts - I remember being shocked when all the stuff came out on Nomar after he left and the media knew it for years that he was a fraud]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Celtics want to tank at this point. They want to have a championship team. That doesn&#039;t come easily.  

Ainge will tanks for a better pick.

With Gerald Wallace at 10mil/yr for the next 3 years, the Celtics won&#039;t look to compete until that contract is off the books.

Look for Rondo to be traded next. The Celtics would be better off with the draft picks Rondo would provide when it comes to putting together a team for 2016 and on.

REPLY - MPC - I still think you can get something out of Wallace - I&#039;m staying on my 41 wins]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How many games will that starting five you proposed play in the 2013-14 season? 

Don&#039;t forget about Washington and Girardi as skippers of the year. 

Rick Pitino is the head coach of Louisville. 

Urban Meyer let a lot of stuff go in Gainesville. How many Gators were arrested while he was there? He covered up for Hernandez and others because it&#039;s all about wins!

I&#039;m not sure if Russ Francis is available but maybe Marv Cook, Ben Coates, or Derrick Ramsey are. 

The East will not be easy for the Heat. Pacers, Nets, and Bulls are on the heels of Miami.
REPLY – MPC – That starting five is more likely to start 70 than Pierce and Garnett / Marv Cook under-rated / Good help on Pitino / Yes on Girardi

		<description><![CDATA[Feels like the &quot;good old days&quot; of Boston sports may be behind us now. Withess today&#039;s Globe: Hernandez in shackles, two! Celtics icons going to the Nets and somewhere in the back was surely a list of Bruins that will not return. It&#039;s been such a fun run - does it really have to end?

REPLY - MPC - Sad times from the Marathon to Hernandez and everything in between]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; Can’t cut Tebow now that the home team has to repair its image with good guys

Yeah right. Tebow will get cut in a nanosecond if he can&#039;t contribute on the field.

REPLY - MPC - Bill would cut over Kraft]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s absolutely no way the Celtics win more than 35 games next year.  And even if they were on pace to do so, Ainge would make them tank.

REPLY - MPC - They will win at least 40]]></description>
