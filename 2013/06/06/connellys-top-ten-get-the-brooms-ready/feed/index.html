		<description><![CDATA[gregory campbell has always seemed a little crazy, particularly when he throws down.  he has this whirling dervish type style in fights.  but he cemented his status as a total maniac by playing on clearly broken bone for over a minute.

yahoo has the whole sequence posted right to the hockey splash page.  re-watching it gives me goosebumps.

Bs need the sweep.  seguin is still cold but, interestingly, i thought he played his best game defensively ever last night.  he made well over 7 strong back-check or neutral zone plays.  and he was dangerous in 2OT.  he&#039;s close.

rEPLY - MPC - I think Seguin knows he stinks on offense and is now figuring he can only help by backchecking]]></description>
