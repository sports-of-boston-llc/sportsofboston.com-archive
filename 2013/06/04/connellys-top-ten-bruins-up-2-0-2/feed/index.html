		<description><![CDATA[Re: &quot;Doc like usual was great.&quot;  Ugh.  It seems that Mike Emrick has become an icon, &#038; it&#039;s sacrilegious to criticize him. I don&#039;t get it. 
 
To me, Emrick should be doing baseball not hockey, as his calls reminds me of Vince Scully. In other words, Welcome to Cornball City.  It&#039;s TV, not radio. A little quiet time is not a bad thing. Someone doesn&#039;t have to speak all the time.  Having said that, I certainly prefer Emrick to the obnoxious self-promoter, Jack Edwards.  Hockey play-by-play guys that I think are better than Emrick would start with B&#039;s radio announcer, Dave Goucher.  Others that I like better than Emrick are John Forslund (Hurricanes &#038; NBC Sports), Joe Beninati (Caps &#038; NBC Sports),  Rick Peckham (Lightening, NBC Sports, &#038; back in the day, the Whalers on Sports Channel),and Jim Hughson.  Hughson does Hockey Night In Canada on the CBC &#038; is very good.  It should be noted, however, that Hughson had a huge miss-call when he called Marchand, not Bergeron, as the scorer of the OT winner in game-7 vs the Leafs.

REPLY - MPC - You are anti-emrite / Goucher is late to the call you can hear the crowd yelling and he is still on the pass to the shooter - what about the guy who did the first round for b&#039;s?]]></description>
