		<description><![CDATA[The best day  was last Tuesday when I heard your voice from the kitchen after I had turned the game on. Yea!!  I became a red sox fan several years ago and although I love the game and the Red Sox, I love listening to you and Don just as much.  The Red Sox need you Remdaug.  It`s just not the same when you are not there with Don.  Thank you Jerry for all you are with the Red Sox.  You make watching a  game more enjoyable and I look forward to each and every one because of  you. I wish you well and the best of health.  You are appreciated and loved from Gorham, Maine.]]></description>
