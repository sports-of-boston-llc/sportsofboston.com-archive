		<description><![CDATA[When discussing the Red Sox &quot;average lineup&quot; have you not considered that the Red Sox are 2nd in all of MLB in batting average, 2nd in hits, first in RBIs and first in Runs? Do you mean that the players are over producing compared to what you thought they would do? Seems like they are doing pretty well this year!

REPLY - MPC - I think the lineup is well constructed and maximize run opportunities - by Napoli, Gomes, Carp, Drew, Salty, etc are average at best as their stats prove out over history - but they are playing great ball ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[if the patriots offered a 1st rounder, the ravens would have rejected it.  it is highly unlikely those 2 teams would ever trade with each other.

REPLY - MPC - in theory correct they would take a first though - never understood how an established nfl player gets traded for such low picks ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[AFC North: everyone is 0-1, are they tied for first or last? 

Will Boras allow Ellsbury to play again this year?

Good call on Wash. State, but Ga. won between the hedges. Where was the defense in that game? 

How did Virginia beat BYU? BYU ran through and around Texas. 

Are the Canes back? 

Keep Middlebrooks and Lester. No reason to trade them away. 

Long season for the Steelers. 

Tough play for Pence. My heart goes out to that pitcher.

REPLY - MPC - Miami part of me wants them back / then Middlebrooks to first now? / I almost like the Steelers glad I didn&#039;t say it / Good call on Hedges / Anyway Mac Brown loses his job?]]></description>
