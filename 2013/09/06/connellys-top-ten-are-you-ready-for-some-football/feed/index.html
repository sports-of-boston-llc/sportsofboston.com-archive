		<description><![CDATA[Dolphins maybe 8 wins, but little chance they win 10 games. Running game issues all season long. 

Colts make the playoffs, not going backwards. They&#039;ll battle Houston for the division. I like the Bengals to win their division. 

Koji could be MVP of this team. Bullpen before Koji concerns me. Thornton is a lefty specialist at this stage of his career.  


I&#039;ll take Ga. between the hedges. Gurley is a beast.

Bridgewater wins the Heisman and he&#039;ll be the number one pick. 

Bet the house on the Colts. Raiders are brutal.

REPLY - MPC - Gurley is like a man playing boys / Bridgewater&#039;s knee ok from last year - I like him / Koji amazing / Is Cherrington executive of the year ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[are you predicting 2 TDs for welker?

how can you predict 42 for brady but gronk only plays 9 games?  i love brady, but he doesn&#039;t sniff 30 if gronk only plays 9 games.

i set the o/u for patriots team sacks at 33.5 and go with the over.  chandler jones!

REPLY - MPC - The Welker thing should went down below - just noting that he had 2 TD last night / Brady td was aggressive / hope Chandler Jones doesn&#039;t hit the wall again]]></description>
