		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s easy to ignore important facts (Welker&#039;s ACL &#038; MCL tears) and call him the most unbreakable force in the history of the NFL and it makes for a great narrative for some really stupid Patriots fans and media people. George, you&#039;re not smarter than Belichick, get over it already.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Where to begin...you mention these other HOF coaches with their record over the last 8-10 years of their careers as you compare Belichick to them, and then mention the 62-20 (which is a 75% winning pct--in this past five year stretch alone, he has a  winning pct that ranks third all time in the history of the league) record Belichick has since the Super Bowl following the &#039;07 season.  Wins and losses is the most objective measure of the job he is doing, and (without checking), I think it&#039;s safe to say the Patriots have one of the top 1-2 records in the entire league in that timeframe.  If the biggest crime is that the team has not won a Super Bowl while getting there once (in addition to two Conference Champsionship games) in a five year span, then they are in pretty damn good shape.  Three coaches have taken a team to the Conference Championship twice and the Super Bowl once in the past two seasons:  Belichick and the two Harbaughs.  That&#039;s what matters if you truly want to look at things objectively.  Seems to me the people focusing on those numbers are the people who are being objective. The man continues to excel in that regard.  Everything else is talk radio fodder and white noise.

PS-Wes Welker has fewer catches than Julian Edelman, and has two more catches than Amendola in spiite of playing one more game.]]></description>
