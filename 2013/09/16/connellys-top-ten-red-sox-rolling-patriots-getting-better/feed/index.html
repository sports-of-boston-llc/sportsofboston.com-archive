		<description><![CDATA[the 78 team was unbeleivable, ed markey should be impeached he is a coward, pawtucket with bogaerts, JBJ, and lavarnway would have won it all

REPLY - MPC - 99 wins and no playoffs / I wouldn&#039;t even cared if Markey voted different from me - have some conviction in life / I think Red Sox make a mistake not trying to win the minor league playoffs - I think there is value for organizational culture]]></description>
