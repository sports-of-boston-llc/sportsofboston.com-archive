		<description><![CDATA[Re: &quot;Interesting the Zoltan Mesko change – hats off to him he was working hard in the community.&quot;

Did anyone think the Pats had a punting problem after last season ended?  This move was driven completely by money.  They saved $900K by whacking Mesko. Ryan Allen may have a &quot;big leg&quot;, but he did not out-perform Mesko in the pre-season games.  Interesting that someone who is supposed to be as fanatically detailed oriented as Belichick, would use a rookie punter as his holder, even though he has never held in his life, including the pre-season that just ended.  

Depending upon who says it, the Pats are under the cap from anywhere from $10M-to-$13M.  It&#039;s always said in a matter of fact manner.  Where&#039;s the criticism?  Brady must be thrilled that he re-worked his deal for this.  Theoretically, the Pats had plenty of cash to re-sign Welker, let Edleman walk away, &#038; then sign Amendola if they wanted to (supposedly, he can play on the outside). The window is closing on Brady.  What are they waiting for???

My guess is that &quot;Mr. Kraft&quot; is using the money saved from the team to produce more audition tapes for his &quot;pal&quot;, Ricki Lander.  Anyone smell an Oscar?

REPLY - MPC - I think you are right it was strictly money - he was coming up on contract at end of the year - hope the holding on kicks isn&#039;t a problem]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought Edgar Rent-an-error was paid over 10 a year and wasn&#039;t Lugo over 10?  but agree Drew is not the best.  They would do it again, because the unknown was potentially worse.  We are the LUCKIEST city and the Greatest

REPLY - MPC - I know that they paid someone to take Renteria which isn&#039;t a good thing - Lugo too maybe so they were long deals]]></description>
