		<description><![CDATA[I disagree with your statement that Brady can &quot;never be the bad soldier&quot;.  I think throwing Ryan Wendell under the bus when Brady caused the fumble is a prime example.  It was completely unnecessary, as I don&#039;t ever recall it happening before.  I don&#039;t think anybody would have crucified Brady for 1-mistake with a snap.  But trying to shift the blame the center is pathetic.

REPLY - MPC - I was saying in his mind he can&#039;t be a bad solider - I agree with you its not what leaders do]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t blame Brady for being angry with BB &#038;/or &quot;Mr. Kraft&quot;.  He redid his contract &#038; then watched them let Welker walk away for relatively short money, &#038; then stay way under the cap (good-bye, Zoltan Kesko).

His receivers are definitely over their head at this point. However, Brady&#039;s outburst on the sideline after Dobson ran the wrong route was over the top.  Give a quick yell at the guy fine.  But these prolonged Brady outbursts are counter productive.  What kind of leadership is that?  

It&#039;s starting to feel like these tantrums are little staged, too.  In other words, &#039;In case you had any doubt, I&#039;m a HOF QB, &#038; these receivers suck.  I didn&#039;t scew-up, they did.&#039;  

I think another example of this was against Buffalo.  Brady fumbled the snap on 4th-&#038;-goal on the goal-line.  All the analysts said Brady pulled out too soon, but when he was asked about it after the game, Brady said &quot;WE have to look at the film&quot;, &#038; &quot;WE have to execute better&quot;.  In other words, it was center Ryan Wendell&#039;s fault.  That&#039;s bad form &#038; horrible leadership.  Even if it was Wendell&#039;s fault (&#038; it wasn&#039;t), Brady should have taken the bullet.  Brady is acting like a diva &#038; should cut it out.

REPLY - MPC - tantrums are a passive aggressive at Belichick - he is mad and can never be the bad solider - he owes the receivers an apology and he should publically say he did that and was out of line]]></description>
