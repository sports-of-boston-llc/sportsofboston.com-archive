		<description><![CDATA[Epic Game! 

Belichick is light years ahead of his coaching brethren. Pats injuries would&#039;ve devastated any other team. 

This game seemed like last years Texans game where as they were dominating the NFL until the Pats game. Now Texans are a shell of their former selves. Don&#039;t be surprised if the Broncos are psychologically concussed. 
Belichick just mentally destroys teams.

REPLY - MPC - I don&#039;t think it is hyperbole to say the Patriots have the lowest level of talent on defense in all of the NFL]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Last week&#039;s loss to Carolina (one play here or there changs the outcome) and we had to read all the Cam Newton &#038; the changing of the guard, the Pats &#038; Brady are fading articles.  

This week the shoes on the other foot.  Brady and Manning are both great, don&#039;t particulaly care who is deemed better.  

The national media has to turn every game into a three part Greek tragedy.  Don&#039;t believe their hype...

REPLY - MPC - Manning is a top five QB - Brady is #1]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ninkovich&#039;s call, at least when compared the later non-calls, was an abomination. Also, that was the Pats gameplan all night long... keep the contact, the officials can&#039;t call &#039;em all. Unfortunately, they called that softie.
But, can&#039;t believe I just read the all-time misquote on possibly one of the best movies.... I&#039;d have to say it was &#039;InCONCEIVABLE&#039; (followed by, &#039;You keep using that word, I dona-thinkit means what you think it means&#039;).  But it was early AM, I know, cheers!

REPLY - MPC - thanks for the pass on time of entry - I think Ninkovich got lazy there and just reached]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike,

I know that you wrote this at 12:30am but ...savor this win.  We&#039;re all second guessers and I didn&#039;t like some of the play calling down the stretch but last night proved (in my opinion) without a doubt why Brady is a better QB than Manning.

This has been a crazy season.  It&#039;s strange that, given his supporting cast this year, Brady seems to have gotten his swagger back with regards to comebacks.  

If Pats D was fully healthy, we would be marching to New York.  Last night proved that we at least still have a shot to get there with small steps.

REPLY - MPC - It was an amazing win and Brady put another stamp on his superiority - their talent level is so low they have no right being in the playoff mix but Brady and Belichick find a way]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was at the game. We didn&#039;t really consider leaving at halftime, but certainly don&#039;t begrudge those who did. Any score by the Broncos would have sent us to the exits. For those of us who do things right by tailgating and staying until the end, we were outside in the single degree wind chill for roughly 11 hours. Don&#039;t ever tell me the Patriots fans are soft now because of success!

REPLY  MPC - hats off to you - I could hardly bring out the rubbish yesterday - yikes - there isn&#039;t enough anti-freeze to get me through three hours.]]></description>
