		<description><![CDATA[also, i&#039;m going to argue that the return to health of gronk and vereen is more of a key than collie, as it relates to the offense!

REPLY - MPC - I&#039;m just looking for a go who can catch the 7 yard out]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[fair question on cherington.  the ownership seemed to have their hands off this year, and let the baseball people do their thing.  it will be interesting to see if that becomes a trend.  i would hope they learned their lesson the past 30 months or so.  they were perilously close to losing a fan base, and now look where they are in a single season by taking a step back.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No on dealing Lester and Lackey.  

Zero chance the SF Giants deal Posey. He&#039;s the face of the franchise. They have won two titles with him behind the plate. 

No on Pujols, not that the Angels would be dealing him anyway. Let him stay and suffer in Orange County. 

I&#039;m open for a Bradley Jr. deal. 

Will Ortiz look for an extension this winter?]]></description>
