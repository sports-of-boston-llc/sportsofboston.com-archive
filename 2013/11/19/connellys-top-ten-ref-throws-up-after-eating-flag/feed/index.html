		<description><![CDATA[Only 1 of the following has to apply for the play to be pass interference … I think the 3 out of 4 do. 
 
•Contact by a defender who is not playing the ball
•Playing through the back of a receiver in an attempt to make play on ball
•Grabbing receiver arms in such a manner that restricts his opportunity to catch a pass
•Extending arm cross body of receiver thus restricting his ability to catch a pass, regardless of whether a defender is playing the ball

The 3rd and 7 scramble and escape by Newton was huge play in that game.

REPLY - MPC - it was with out question a bad call or non call or gutless flag pick up]]></description>
