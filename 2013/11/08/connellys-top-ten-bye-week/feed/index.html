		<description><![CDATA[I was with you on the shortstops until I got to Alex Gonzales.  Are you kidding? He has a .290 lifetime OBP and played one year for the Red Sox! You also have Vern Stephens too low - #2 would be more like it.

The Rolling Stones and Reubens are the things that make life worth living!  Get with it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[it&#039;s trendy to bash stephen drew, but i&#039;d take him back for another year.  try like hell to move middlebrooks, and give bogaerts the hot corner.  i liked drew&#039;s defense... also, for all the complaints about drew&#039;s hitting, he was in the top-5 in all of baseball in OPS for everyday shortstops.

that doesn&#039;t say much about the position, but still.]]></description>
