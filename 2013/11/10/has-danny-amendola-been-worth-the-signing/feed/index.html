		<description><![CDATA[I too have to disagree with your assessment. Namely the last sentence. The Patriots don&#039;t need Fitz because they seem to have a developing deep threat in Aaron Dobson. Fitz isn&#039;t really the slot type receiver that they need. Plus, Amendola&#039;s struggle aren&#039;t all his own as we have all seen that Brady has missed his targets on several occassions and the offense wasn&#039;t quite clicking until this past week.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[my counter-point to your commentary is this; amendola is six years younger than welker, and when doing the math amendola averages 12.8 yds/catch with welker averaging 11.1 yds/catch. Also, it was welker who chose to abandon new england not n.e. jetising welker. Maybe if welker could hang onto the ball in the BIG games n.e would have given him the extra money.]]></description>
