		<description><![CDATA[After beating Duke in 1985 at the University of Houston, BC would lose their next game in Dallas (Reunion Arena)against Memphis State. Tigers were led by Andre &quot;Little General Turner who played for the Celtics very briefly. Memphis also had William Bedford and Keith Lee.

REPLY - MPC - That Memphis team must have been wild off the court in the 80&#039;s - what I remember about that is that BC had the lead and the ball was going out of bounds baseline and someone saved it for Memphis and just threw it out to the top of the key where Andre Turner caught the ball and drilled the game winner]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Favorite BC hoops memory is when they beat Duke at the University of Houston in 1985 (second round of tourney). 

Even better, Curley and the Eagles taking down Indiana and Bobby Knight (Damon Bailey&#039;s last game as a Hoosier) in Miami to advance to the elite 8 against the Gators. 

Doubront will finish the year on the disabled list. He comes across as lazy. 

Opening Day in Motown 1986 was the best. Evans took the first pitch from Jack Morris and put it in the upper deck at old Tiger Stadium. 

Opening Day 1987 not so good. Bob Stanley took the ball in the opener in Millwaukee. 

Will the Heat finish with more wins than the Marlins?

REPLY - MPC - They should have beat Houston in the Final 8? I had a keg party in my room for the 1986 opener. Astros have a bigger problem than Marlins - ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[.. and then Dempster, Lackey, and Doubront.  Its a good staff from top to bottom.  Doubront, in particular has some real upside potential.

		<description><![CDATA[You are way too pessimistic on the Red Sox.  &#062;80 wins?! No way. 

The lineup is no worse than average, but the pitching staff should be well above average.  Closer to 90 than 80 wins I would say.

REPLY - MPC - above average (bullpen I will give you) Lester, Buchholz and then.........]]></description>
