		<description><![CDATA[Things have changed a bit in the standings, and it&#039;s now looking like the Nuggets would play the Golden State Warriors first round, but with how tight the race has become, who knows what&#039;s going to happen?  I can see each team in the western playoffs being capable of beating ANY other team, so there&#039;s not much need for speculation, lol.  I like to keep tabs on the rest of the west, when I&#039;m not watching a Nuggets game, and with my new app I can turn the games on live, on my iPad, as soon as my shift at DISH ends.  I like watching the games on the bus ride home, and DISH Anywhere lets me take all my live TV and DVR with me on-the-go.  It&#039;s like watching the game from my couch at home, except for all the rabid OKC fans on the bus next to me!]]></description>
