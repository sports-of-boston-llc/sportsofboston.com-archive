		<description><![CDATA[Best Resurrection addition:
- Luke Jackson, after eating 50 hard-boiled eggs

Worst General:
- Major General (U.S&#062;)/Brigadier General (England) Benedict Arnold

- Re: McCaskill (comment section): he was both all-ECAC in hockey &#038; baseball.  I was sitting in the dorms at UVM hoping for him to lose in &#039;86.  But a great Catamount nonetheless; little trivia - The Rooster, Burleson, DH-ed for the Halos in that playoff series...

REPLY - MPC - Good General / Luke Jackson excellent / did not remember Burleson hitting for them nice note]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[over-rated..bucket list. 

Agree on Beamer. Va. Tech did nothing before he arrived.Bruce Smith only player from Va. Tech before Beamer arrived. Beamer has had issues with players in the police blotter. 

Remember, Tubby Smith won that national title because of slick Rick. 

Best moment for Buckner in 1990. His HR off of Kirk McCaskill (played hockey at Vermont) and Claudell Washington ended up in the seats and Buckner gets an inside-the-park-home run.

REPLY - MPC - Amazing Buckner got around on those ankles / Tubby was a recipient of talent but he seems to do well everywhere / no doubt on Va Tech police issues]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Willie Mays had a Sox tryout. From baseball-fever.com:
&quot;The general manager of their AA team in Birmingham, Alabama alerted them to a phenomenal prospect on the Birmingham Black Barons whose contract could be bought for only $5,000. Even though the Red Sox&#039; local scout echoed the rave reviews, GM Joe Cronin wasn&#039;t interested...and so Willie Mays became a Giant.&quot;
Passover, indeed...

REPLY - MPC - Good one imagine him in center, Yaz in left and a healthy Tony C for the 60&#039;s]]></description>
