		<description><![CDATA[Just a few questions:
1. Why can&#039;t Paul Pierce dribble anymore?  He has always been a second rate dribbler, but now I wince every time he starts his moves.  His turnover rate from botched ball handling is scary.
2. Is anybody out there who would like to reverse the Green for Perkins trade?  You know who you are - the ones who thought the world was ending when the wonderful Perkins was traded. 
3. Is there a more disappointing expectation than the one that said that Terry would replace Allen?
4. If they kept stats on missing layups, would any team even be close to the Celtics?]]></description>
