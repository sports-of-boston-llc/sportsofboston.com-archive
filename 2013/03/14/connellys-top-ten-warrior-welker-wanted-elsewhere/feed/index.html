		<description><![CDATA[I love Wes, but I understand what the Patriots did--they didn&#039;t want to be left without a date to the dance.  They can only make a commitment to a player if the player is willing to make a commitment to them.  That the tradeoff of &quot;testing the market&quot; in free agency. See http://espn.go.com/boston/nfl/story/_/id/9050742/2013-nfl-free-agency-new-england-patriots-quickly-shifted-wes-welker-danny-amendola

REPLY - MPC - It was a divorce that started with the Rex Ryan comments and never recovered]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A gifted, super-loyal player who breaks the pass-receiving records, has a wonderful sense-of-humor (for which he gets punished), bonds with the community and his fellow players, and they elbow him off the team and out-of-town. What is not to hate? Worse, I understand. Taking all those hits for the team, he is now damaged goods. Amendola (never heard of him) is younger, probably faster. if he is as skilled and coachable as Bellichick usually finds, it was a smart move by the Pats. 
     But not a pretty one.

REPLY - MPC - A divorce that never needed to happen for sure but its over]]></description>
