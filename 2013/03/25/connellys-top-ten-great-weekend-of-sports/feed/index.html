REPLY - MPC - Some news station should set up a camera in Clark Booth&#039;s home and allow commentary - he would have been amazing in the sports talk shows these days ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Marquette is tough to watch but they get the job done. Win and advance is the name of the game this time of year. 

Arizona head coach Sean Miller appeared on Johnny Carson when he was in middle school because of his ball handling skills. 

Agree on Vision Quest.

REPLY - MPC - good note on Sean Miller - he can now host the Johnny Carson show as he has time available]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was at that Boston-Oakland game!  10 years old and wetting my pants with excitement to be seeing the Red Sox at Fenway for the first time. It turned into a long afternoon.  

What was the final, 21-7?

REPLY - MPC - I think you are right - Jackson one of the true prima donna&#039;s of sports]]></description>
