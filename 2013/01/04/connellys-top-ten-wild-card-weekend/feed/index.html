		<description><![CDATA[And Carney played pretty darn well for the A&#039;s for a number of years thereafter, although he was certainly no Wade Boggs.

REPLY - MPC - Couldn&#039;t say no to Boggs - to bad one of them couldn&#039;t have switched positions]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When it all said and done I bet Luke Kuechly will go down as the best BC player of all time.

REPLY - MPC - Are you talking in the pro&#039;s? Interesting item for Top Ten - Art Donovan, some offensive linemen, Smerlas.... ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[what did we get for Cassel and Vrabel from KC?  I agree move Mallet, he wouldn&#039;t fit in the scheme anyway

REPLY - MPC - We ended up getting KC&#039;s second round pick which back then seemed like a steal for both quality players but if I remember Vrabel was doing a  lot of talking back then. Did you see him head bang one of his Ohio state players this year - google]]></description>
