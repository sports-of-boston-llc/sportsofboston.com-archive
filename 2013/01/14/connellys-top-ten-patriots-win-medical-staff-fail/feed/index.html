		<description><![CDATA[The actor you refer to in the State Farm commercials is J.K. Simmons. He&#039;s a great &#038; versatile character actor. Among his other many credits:

He played a scary/evil white supremacist(Schillinger)in HBO&#039;s &quot;Oz&quot;. - He played the newspaper editor in the Toby Maguire &quot;Spider-Man&quot; movies. -
He played Ellen Page&#039;s father in &quot;Juno&quot;.

Here&#039;s some commercial trivia for you.  The actor (Richard Easton), who plays Ben Franklin in the Free Mason commercials, is the actor who played the character (Jackson Parkhurst)that Jimmy &#038; Richard scalped in Season-2 of &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;.

REPLY - MPC - Good Stuff - I&#039;m surprised that wholesome safe insurance company might associate with a guy who plays parts like that]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scary when you think that it was not Brady&#039; best game, that they left points on the field, and STILL scored. 41.

Having said that, I didn&#039;t like the bend don&#039;t break defense the last eight minutes of the game.

REPLY - MPC - To look up and see that a field goal and touchdown would tie that game was unnerving]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Pats miss Julian Edelman?! Really? Did he make one big play in the passing game this year?  If he did I missed it.

Richard Sherman probably makes the 10 pro bowls no matter what he says.  Russell Wilson will make a few of them as well.

REPLY - MPC - I just see Sherman being mouthy with a cop or someone with a bigger gun / Edelman could stretch the field and they miss him on special teams big time - now no Gronk, Edleman and Woodhead?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Both Harbaugh&#039;s do a lot of jawing at the refs during the course of a game.

Very few sightings of both Patrick Chung and Deion Branch.

Tony C. was done at 30 and Ernie D. at 27.

REPLY - MPC - I loved Ernie D&#039;s game - his best being Havlicek&#039;s best with the Celtics / I like Jim Haubaugh but will hate him coaching against the local team]]></description>
