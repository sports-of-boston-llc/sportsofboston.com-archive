		<description><![CDATA[Couldn&#039;t agree more about Pierce. While most superstars make those around him better, Pierce is the opposite...... He makes Everyone worse. Ainge should&#039;ve got rid of him last year while he had some worth. He is/has been slow and always out of shape. Now he&#039;s slow, old, out of shape and doesn&#039;t care. The wheelchair game was all anyone should need to tell you what a pos he is. 

I hope Al Gore&#039;s flight to Davos runs out of gas and is forced to land in Western Africa where he is eaten by Cannibals. He&#039;s extorted more money from American Corporations than the Gambino&#039;s, Columbo&#039;s, Bonano&#039;s, Genovese and Luchesse&#039;s combined. Hypocrite! 

As for Al Jazeera they are just as bad as the NYT. Both hate America. 

Mike, reading your column is like reading Will McDonough in the old days. You should be writing for a major publication.

REPLY - MPC - To be linked at all with one of the greatest sports writers of our time is an amazing compliment - thank you! The wheelchair game / the debacle in Indiana / the surley behavior is the real Pierce in my estimation. Excellent point about others around him - he&#039;s the anti Bird]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; Gore recently sold his television station to Al Jazeera for $100,000,000, joining the ranks of Jane Fonda and Benedict Arnold

You are way off base here--in fact, its hard for me to see how you could be further off base unless you are deliberately being &quot;obtuse&quot;.  We are not at war with Al Jazeera.  In fact, by watching more Al Jazeera, we could learn a lot about the mideast and the way people who live there think and feel. Unfortunately, as a nation, we are fairly ignorant about that part of the world, and learning more could only benefit us, especially considering our historical dependence on mideast oil. The sale of Current TV to Al Jazeera will likely benefit the USA by educating us and giving us a global perspective. Conversely, had Current been sold to the only other suitor (Glenn Beck&#039;s network), it certainly would have harmed the USA by further spreading false and inflammatory claims.

REPLY - MPC - Please don&#039;t be naive - Al Jazeera has been a propaganda machine for terrorist for years. They provided a vehicle for terrorists to spread their message of hate and evil. And if that represented 1% of their broadcasts its 100% to much. This guy wanted to be president (after Love Story and inventing the internet and then talked about the world and used more energy than any house in Tennessee and then made a move on the massage girl)and now he is profiting off a virtual arm of hate]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your disdain for Paul Pierce unjustified, and a bit mean-spirited.  Age catches up with all of them eventually.  Paul was a durable, consistent All-Star forward for the team for many years.  He gave great effort at both ends of the floor.  Probasketballreference.com lists Barry, Dantley, Wilkins, Havlicek as the most similar players, and I think that is absolutely the appropriate peer group for Paul. (Pippen probably another SF of that quality.) Are those guys &quot;superstars&quot;?  I guess it is a question of nomenclature.  They are certainly &quot;stars&quot; that are good enough to be the #2 player on a title team.

You need to give the &quot;new big 3&quot; their props!

REPLY - MPC - The second big 3 got a championship (Game 7 vs. Cleveland was Pierce&#039;s greatest moment) and a Game 7 but other than that I think he has always been a numbers guy who doesn&#039;t deliver - no one in the NBA would ever trade Pippen or Havlicek or Barry or Wilkens for Pierce - maybe over the top but I&#039;m investing in that game Sunday and he is allowing his player to get to the board, throwing passes away and generally stinking the place up - if he&#039;s washed up then he&#039;s Jim Rice refusing to wear glasses]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[$100M can sure buy a lot of Hash &#038; Prius&#039; for Al Gore III.

What&#039;s your take on the Globe article about Robert Parish wanting to be an NBA coach but needs a high six or seven figure salary to do so?

REPLY - MPC - Parish is one of the luckiest athletes of all time - beside being granted height he played on the weak side of a top 5 all time player and the greatest low post player of all time / he then was stupid enough to have drugs mailed to his house if I remember right and then from reports his wife had a habit of &quot;bruising&quot; I would hire him to sit people ]]></description>
