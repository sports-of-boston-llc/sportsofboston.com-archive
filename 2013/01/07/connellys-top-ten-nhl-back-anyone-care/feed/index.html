		<description><![CDATA[I think its great hockey is back. The NBA players make more money and were far more greedy in their lockout but that is forgotten now this will be as well. Go Bruins!

REPLY - MPC - This might be naive but millionaires who can&#039;t settle when unemployment is above 8 are dumb - I&#039;m happy for hockey fans because they are the most loyal and deserving]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A couple of non-lockout hockey notes... 

Note-1: It was nice to see the US win the Gold in the World Juniors in Ufa, Russia. One slight downer was the US beat Canada 5-1 in the semifinals &#038; B&#039;s pick goalie Malcolm Subban was pulled after 4-goals on 16-shots.  In Subban&#039;s defense, on at least two of those goals he had no chance due to screens.

Note-2: The current favorite to be the overall #1 pick in the 2013 NHL draft is 6&#039;-4&quot; defenseman, Seth Jones.  He&#039;s an American &#038; the son of former NBA player, Popeye Jones (briefly a Celtic).  If Jones is the number-1 pick, he would be the first African American or African Canadian ever to be selected #1 overall in the NHL draft. Popeye is now a coach with the Nets.  I apologize if this is a duplicate note that I missed.

REPLY - MPC - Watched teh championship game - that kid who scored Gramboni was a grinder / Good note on Jones - he looked good]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The only way we hockey fans can show our angst about the third shut down in 20 years is to not buy tickets or merchandise. For me I would love the arenas to be so empty that on the opening face-off  the first puck drop echos. Failing that when the players take the ice it&#039;s to boos not cheers.

REPLY - MPC - Insanity with no idea whats going on in the real world]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Speaking of murders. Nice to see that ESPN has already negotiated with Ray Lewis for next year. There has been alot of criminal behavior in Bristol over the years but I think murder brings a whole different kind of street cred down there. He is garbage and a thug.

REPLY - MPC - I guarantee the first time they will have him dance onto the set]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is important to remember that NYC, L.A., and Chicago are 13 times, 6 times and 4 times as large as Boston respectively.  New Orleans on the other hand has half the population of Boston.  They have a real problem down there.

REPLY - MPC - Good point on population though if you added Greater Boston it would be closer and count would still be dramatically less. New Orleans is way down although half the population is in Houston now]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tough situation with RG3. The correct decision in hindsight would have been to pull him and put in Cousins, if not for the game, then at least for the second half after it should have become clear RG3 hurt himself more and was no longer effective. But I personally don&#039;t know of anyone who, in the heat of the moment, would have gotten that decision right--not even myself, who is otherwise perfect ;-) At the end of the day, football is entertainment and that&#039;s what the fans wanted to see, RG3, win with him, or lose with him. I hope he didn&#039;t wreck his knee too bad.

REPLY -MPC - It definitely became a football decision in the second half and Shannahan couldn&#039;t pull the trigger]]></description>
