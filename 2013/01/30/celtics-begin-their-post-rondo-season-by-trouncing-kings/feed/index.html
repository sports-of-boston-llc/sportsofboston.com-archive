This team looks like they could benefit, at least in the short term, on both offense and defense from the added pace and energy the new rotation brings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As good as Rondo is, he&#039;s always had one major flaw - his tendency to walk the ball up the court.  Almost as if he&#039;s so sure of his passing ability that he only needs 14 seconds or so to find the open man.  Tommy Heinsohn has pointed it out for years, and Dominique Wilkins pointed it out doing color commentary for Atlanta in that fateful game where we lost Rondo. Wilkins said that Rondo, despite all of his other skills, holds onto the ball too long, and he&#039;s right.

Let&#039;s see what happens against a better team than Sacramento with Lee and Bradley racing up and down the court and getting rid of the ball ASAP.  Maybe we&#039;ll surprise everybody (except Tommy) and actually thrive under a fast paced, pass the ball quickly offense.  Time will tell.]]></description>
