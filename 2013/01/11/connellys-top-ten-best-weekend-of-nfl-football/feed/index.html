		<description><![CDATA[Sullinger is actually a better per-minute rookie rebounder than either Larry or Antoine!  He just isn&#039;t getting the minutes.  Doc doesn&#039;t like to play the rooks.

Going back a bit, but Lefty Grove was 4-2 with 1.75 ERA and 1.01 WHIP in WS play.  I actually think I would take him over anyone on your list, except maybe Gibson.

I think your list under #6 nicely highlights a number of HOFers that maybe shouldn&#039;t be there.

REPLY - MPC - If I was Ainge I would have traded Sullenger two minutes after that game and got value a rich man&#039;s Danya Abrams /// Kiner is insane / Good one with Lefty Grove]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agree with Steve above on Koufax.
 
Bird&#039;s prowess on the boards were an underrated part of his game as he averaged over ten a game for his career.  

Pats 2008 loss to the G-men in the SB was the third highest spread covered in the SB.  Both the Jets &#038; Chiefs in SB&#039;s III &#038; IV covered higher spreads.

REPLY-MPC - Bird was so smart his positioning and understanding angles made his lack of vertical irrelevant / Pats beat a high favored Rams team also]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting though I had the other day. If the Patriots get to the Superbowl to face either the 49ers or the Seahawks, it could be the first time they would have to play every game of the postseason against a team they played against during the regular season. Might be worth mentioning later on pending playoff results

REPLY - MPC - Love the contribution - and very interesting - who makes the best adjustments]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wouldn&#039;t mind giving the ball to Koufax in that situation.

Good call on Ross.  Not sure the others on that list could hold a candle to his annoyance level

REPLY - MPC - Of course Koufax - interesting his record in postseason doesn&#039;t reflect how well he pitched 4-3 but ERA insane 0.95 - whip insane 0.825 - strikeouts to walks 61-11 - I move him up to second - big miss (on another note - I called Pedro the greatest pitcher of all time but wouldn&#039;t put him on the list at 6-4 / 3.46 ERA)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agree with David H, today is some of your best stuff.  On pitcher for one game, Bob Gibson hands down.  Dave Stewart had that scowl #2, but what about a Dwight Gooden at his peak in 85?  Greenwell must Hate Canseco for stealing his MVP in &#039;88 while on Juice

REPLY - MPC - Gooden postseason surprisingly 0-4 /3.97 ERA / if I was canseco I would deliver the trophy to Greenwell and petition baseball to make the change - just like McGwire should ask baseball to asterisk his HR (and Bonds and Sosa) and give the HR season title back to the Maris family]]></description>
