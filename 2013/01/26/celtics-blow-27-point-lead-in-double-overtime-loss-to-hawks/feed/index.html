		<description><![CDATA[In a game with many, many things to feel disgusted about, nothing stands out for me as being more ridiculous than having Paul Pierce take the potential game winning shot at the end of the first overtime.  Who decided to let an ice cold Pierce do this?  A coach&#039;s decision? Rondo&#039;s? What in the world is going on here?  Pierce is looking pathetic lately, shooting horribly, fumbling balls, having his dribble fall apart, and someone decides he should take a critical shot in a game where he can&#039;t hit the broad side of a barn.  Huh? Nobody has more respect for Pierce&#039;s contributions to the Celtics than I do, but past is past and now is now and old legs are old legs.  Let&#039;s not keep embarrassing him.  At least they finally took him off of Korver.  Too little, too late.]]></description>
