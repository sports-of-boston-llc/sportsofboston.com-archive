		<description><![CDATA[There is no way that Rask flops as much as Thomas did. That was Thomas&#039; style.  When Rask is playing well, his style is very &quot;quiet&quot;.  He is square to the shooter, makes the saves look easy, &#038; limits the rebounds.  That is his usual MO.  

However, I agree that when Rask is not playing well, he becomes overly-agressive &#038; does go down too early.  That&#039;s the exception to the rule, though.

REPLY - MPC - Playoffs are coming we&#039;ll see who is better]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll take the over and say 84 wins.  

Awful NCAA tourney so far. Just a handful of good games. 

Middlebrooks will lead the team in HRs. 

Lester will win 17 games. 

Ortiz will play more than 100 games. 

Pat Riley was on that Kentucky team that lost to Texas Western.

REPLY - MPC - I&#039;ll save these predictions - Riley and Ainge cage match]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Yankee$ gave Youk 12 million bucks, is that fair market value?
Much rather have Papi.


But as with Papi it doesnt matter since there was noone else out there and they have the money.

Its gonna sting watching Youk bat cleanup for the Yank$ but how was he gonna turn down 12 million when his next offer was maybee 5...

REPLY - MPC - Both are stupid - you won&#039;t get value for that money]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Red Sox 80 wins. Maybe! I&#039;m surprised anyone pays for a ticket to see this train wreck. 
Since Sept 2011 when this team stopped playing and started whining, I&#039;m surprised anyone goes to the dump on Yawkey Way. The flim flam men did a good job though trying to polish a sneaker. 
Fenway Park aka Bozo&#039;s Big Top Circus.

REPLY - MPC - I was on Bozo and Rex Trailer - ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Stop whining and get behind the team! 

Who cares how much Papi earns the &quot;extra&quot; money he got wouldn&#039;t have gone to any other player. Sox still had 9 million over for Drew, the other players out there did not offer much at all. Papi could earn 25 mill for all I care he has earned it earlier in his career.

Go Sox!

REPLY - MPC - So why don&#039;t we pay Tony C and Ted Williams estates also if we are paying on history and not production?]]></description>
