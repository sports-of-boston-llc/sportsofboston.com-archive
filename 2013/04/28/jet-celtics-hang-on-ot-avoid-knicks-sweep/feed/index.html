		<description><![CDATA[It only took an entire season plus 4 playoff games to see Jason Terry do something that was expected of him from the start - actually contribute to a win.  Hooray? Do I hear the sound of one hand clapping? Actually, Terry&#039;s biggest contribution came in the previous game when he got J.R. Smith to smash him with an elbow that cost Smith a suspension in game 4.  Does anyone doubt that the suspension made it possible for the Celts to barely hold off the Knicks?  

It&#039;s hard to be enthusiastic about anything this team has done in the playoffs, much less feeling Celtic Pride over the victory after a blown 20 point lead. Too old, too slow, too short on talent.  That seems to sum it up nicely.]]></description>
