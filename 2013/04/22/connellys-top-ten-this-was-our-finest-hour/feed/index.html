		<description><![CDATA[&quot;D&#038;C did a great job – should have went with the hot hand&quot; - said nobody...ever. The show is terrible and the ratings suggest that. Callahan getting a bad rap, he should leave or get a new partner (but not really up to him at this point, I suppose). No one wants to listen to John Dennis. The way Dennis responds to some callers and listeners on the show and via Twitter shows off his unbearable personality.

Your long time suggestion for people to sing the National Anthem is right on though. Too bad it took an event like this for it to take hold! Hopefully it stays strong. I was at the Bruins game on Saturday and it was very moving.

REPLY - MPC - When sung with passion it is an under-rated anthem / D&#038;C ratings are down no doubt]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like the SB suggestion, Michael, but would tweak it to be net SBs, subtract the times hitters were caught, too.

REPLY - MPC - I would have to think about that, if you gain a base you should get credit but when you lose a base hmmm - interesting]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The first thought that I had when they announced that the crowd would sing the anthem is that you have been saying that for years. I give you credit - I may be the only one, but I want to be on the record as saying that you have been beating that drum for years.

Woke up mad yesterday.  Now that they have captured the two main suspects (there are certainly more somewhere) I am angry about the lack of guts in a lot of our politicians.  There has been so much talk about Menino&#039;s and Patrick&#039;s leadership.  The two of them were tripping over each other to be first in line to be at ground breaking ceremonies and press conferences about the &quot;community center&quot; mosque that they were so anxious to see built.  A few years ago the Wall St Journal wrote about the radical imam that is behind the thing and all the radical money that is involved in the funding.  Menino didn&#039;t care - he was busy with important issues like making sure that Chic Fil A can&#039;t come to Boston.  I wonder how many people in line at Chic Fil A appreciation day were considered suspects in the bombing.

The night that they caught the second bomber, the president gives a briefing and cautions us about jumping to conclusions about motives etc.  I would love to see someone at time like this give a lecture to the Islamic community about self policing.  That would show courage.  People don&#039;t rush out to burn down mosques after an event like this.  There were some pretty clear photos of these two and there was not a flurry of tips to the authorities once they were shown.  

Until there is a problem with Americans terrorizing people in mosques and pulling people out of their homes to torment them - spare us the lectures on xenophobia and stop trying to out PC each other.

REPLY - MPC - Its funny - our country has always had the foundation as roll up the sleeves, cowboy type society that we tell as it is. Somehow we have morphed 180 to the other side where we dance around subjects to our own detriment. What happened to candor and honesty and personal pride? I don&#039;t know - we are as*backwards]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Totally agree about the Orsillo HR call. It was his finest moment. Top notch!

Bailey was shaky on Saturday. He did get the save but he walked the tightrope. 

Great story about Neil Diamond jumping on a plane in LA and coming to Boston. He invited himself. 

Great to hear about 102.5--props to them. Keep us updated if they stop playing it at noon. 

Celtics&#039; bench was awful. I had high hopes for Terry when he signed with Boston.

Boston in the 4th qtr. set basketball back fifty years. 

Auburn has bigger issues than that tree. They did draw big the other day for their spring game but that program is in trouble.

REPLY - MPC - So frustrating to watch Celts Saturday - they look like they should be in the CBA / Auburn true that / yes Orsillo&#039;s greatest moment / Bailey made me throw up in my mouth]]></description>
