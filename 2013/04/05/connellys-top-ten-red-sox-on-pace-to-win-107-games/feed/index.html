		<description><![CDATA[Iglesias will be back at AAA early next week because Drew is returning. 9.5 million will get the bulk of the playing time at ss. 

Yes, Rivera and Pettite are #1 on that list. Ahead of Eck and Bob Welch. 

Agree on Victorino and Pedroia. 

Bad point on Pitino. 

Is Bob Hohler&#039;s story still up on Boston.com? If so, that is in poor taste.

REPLY - MPC - I found the article on line somewhere - good combo note Eck and Welch - both crazy on the outside half of teh plate]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Speaking of resting pitchers after losing no-hitters, think the Mets wish they had yanked Santana during his no-hitter last year? Threw a career-high 134 pitches and finished the game with a 2.38 ERA on July 2. Finished the season throwing 117 innings with an ERA of 4.85, and now his career is probably over. Got to wonder.

REPLY - MPC - No doubt that he never recovered - ]]></description>
