		<description><![CDATA[I still think the guys&#039; uncle had it right: &quot;They are losers.&quot; Had more to do with that than ideology, dirtballs were just looking for something to blame their troubles on.
Mom sure is a piece of work, though, got that right. 
On the stolen base thing from last week, if a guy steals 20 bases and is caught 10 times, he is far less valuable than someone who goes 20 for 22. I would say that needs to be accounted for if SBs are going to be credited to hitters in a total base stat, and I agree they should.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In 2012, Buchholz got his fifth win in early June. 

I was at Clemens&#039; first loss back in 1986. A home loss to the Blue Jays. Jimmy Key got the win and George Bell hit a HR into the screen in left. It rained all day but it cleared up late afternoon. 

Bartolo Colon recorded his 174th win the other night against Boston. A lot of wins for an out of shape looking pitcher. 

Courtney Lee is in Doc&#039;s doghouse. 

Jones had a strong season with the dawgs. A transfer from USC. Trojans&#039; doctors wouldn&#039;t clear him to play. 

Does Kevin McHale age? Still looks the same after all these years. 

Crawford dropped another ball in left against the Mets.Quite similar to the last game back in 2011 in Baltimore. Should have stayed and played in front of friends and family members in St. Pete. 

Brady 3-0 in bowl games while at Michigan.]]></description>
