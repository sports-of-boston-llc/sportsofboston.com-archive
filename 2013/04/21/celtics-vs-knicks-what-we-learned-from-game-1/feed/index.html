		<description><![CDATA[For the life of me, I can&#039;t even figure out why Terry is still given playing time.  After earning the &quot;dud of the year award&quot; in regular season play, and promoting himself as a &quot;crunch time player who just needs to know who HE can count on in the playoffs&quot; (are you kidding me), he only did what I expected him to do in game #1 - nothing.  In a league replete with guards who can at least shoot the ball, it&#039;s mighty sad that Jason Terry is even on the team.

I&#039;m also confused about Doc&#039;s decision not to give any court time to Randolph when the Celts dearly needed rebounding, or Williams, who earned his chance with some aggressive play before the playoffs.

How a professional team can only score 8 points in the fourth quarter of a playoff game is beyond me, especially when they had a realistic chance to steal game #1.  Very embarrasing.]]></description>
