		<description><![CDATA[Lots of conflicting info re: that interrogation. Once good source says court did NOT step in with Miranda rights until the FBI interview was over. There has been a lot of misinformation from the get-go in this case; I would hesitate to jump to any conclusions about the situation, honestly, and some have tried to make hay by creating talking points out of it. Let&#039;s wait and see until we have more facts.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree on the interrogation comment. I&#039;m so sick and tired of people not willing to take a common sense approach to a situation like this. Eric Holder is a disgrace as attorney general. He refused to prosecute the New Black Panther case - he wants Kalid Sheik Mohammed tried in civilian court in NY city and now this. He says America is a nation of cowards, unwilling to have a discussion on race. With pinheads like him in positions of authority, what good would any discussion on anything do?

Maybe we&#039;ll get another lecture soon about not jumping to conclusions. He isn&#039;t curious at all as to what the facts are surrounding this case. More information comes out every day about these two and their family. Why did they become radicalized? Who were they associated with? Things that would certainly be helpful to the safety of the citizenry.

Deval Patrick seems more concerned with respecting their privacy. He isn&#039;t allowing the information to flow about their public assistance programs. I will never understand the mindset of the PC crowd. Those two are building their street cred with the liberals. This isn&#039;t a college campus - it&#039;s the country that you are in charge of protecting. Wake up!

REPLY - MPC - Concerned more about their careers than public which is ironic because its the public that makes their career but people don&#039;t hold anyone accoutable]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Draft grades right now are foolish. 

Pierce played nearly 50 minutes, does he have enough in the tank for Wed. night? Shumpert has taken his lunch money a handful of times. 

Finally, Jason Terry showed up. 

Bass is one player that misses Rondo. Rondo would set up him up and Bass would knock down that open jumper. 

Friday night&#039;s game was brutal. Fans should get their money back. 

Belichick predicatable this past weekend. Trades out of round 1 and drafts Rutgers players. 

Where will Freeney end up? Would look good with the Patriots. Depending on the money but he would fill a need.

REPLY - MPC - I actually thing Bass is playing the best of the season now seems to be applying himself / good point on Freeny he is cheaper in june]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; If the Attorney General interrupted the FBI’s legal interrogation of Suspect 2, then that is either gross incompetence or treason

You have it backwards.  The FBI is part of the DOJ which is headed by the Attorney General.  He calls the shots, not the FBI.  If the FBI is refusing the follow the directives of the Attorney General, that would be insubordination (unlike you, I am not willing to use the term treason so lightly).]]></description>
