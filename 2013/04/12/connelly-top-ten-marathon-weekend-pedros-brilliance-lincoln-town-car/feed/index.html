		<description><![CDATA[Hmm it looks like your blog ate my first comment (it was 
super long) so I guess I&#039;ll just sum it up what I wrote and say, I&#039;m thoroughly enjoying your blog.
I as well am an aspiring blog blogger but I&#039;m still new to everything. Do you have any suggestions for rookie blog writers? I&#039;d genuinely appreciate 
it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[They have found other bombs which were no yet exploded which means it is either a team or a very well organized person. Either way there are hundreds of cameras and people who took pictures in Boston today and some one took a picture of the bomber(s), It just is going to take time to sort through the evidence and identify them. Every bomb has the signature of the person who made it, and how it was constructed. The intelligence and law enforcement people have done a good job of protecting the US from terrorist attacks, something which is very difficult to do in an open society. I am surprised that there have not been more successful attempts. it is to be expected in a country which is conducting war around the world against many terrorist organizations..]]></description>

Tom Tupa doubled as a punter and qb.
