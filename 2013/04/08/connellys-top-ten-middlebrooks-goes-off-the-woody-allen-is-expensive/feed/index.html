		<description><![CDATA[Seriously, are they any players you dont want to trade?? It&#039;s called supporting the team. 
You wwrote off the sox before a pitch was even thrown. I think you&#039;ll soon be singing a different tune. They look pretty good!

REPLY - MPC - Ellsbury is gone at the end of the season get value for him now / Igleisias is not in their plans and they have 5 of the top 50 shortstop prospects in majors so move him while he&#039;s hitting over .300 because he will end up less than .220 / Bailey is a luxury that other teams don&#039;t have (ie. Detroit) so get value back for him - I&#039;d also trade Aceves before he ends up in jail. This is the year to load up - nice job with dodgers trade now keep going and build a perrenial winner with young and old - infield - Bogerts 3b, Maerro SS, Pedroia, Middlebrooks - catching one of their prospects with a Ross behind him / outfield Bradley and two studs - I will up my win total to 83 from 79]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Re: your comment, &quot;How about a summer blockbuster: Seguin, Rask and Lucic in the offseason for value&quot;. 

Huh??? The Kings won the Cup with the 8th seed last year. Let&#039;s wait to see what happens in the playoffs before we plan to gut the team. To quote the great leader, Sgt. Hulka, &quot;Lighten up, Francis.&quot;

REPLY - MPC - Where&#039;s Tim Thomas when you need him - &quot;you call me Francis - I&#039;ll kill ya&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tough day yesterday for past Cy Young winners. Dickey, Price, Verlander, and Cain got roughed up and got the L. 

Masterson solid again yesterday. 2-0 and nobody is touching him. Bad trade by Theo. 

Questionable calls down the stretch in the Cuse and Michigan game.

REPLY - MPC - I was surprised how calm Boeheim was through those calls / Masterson trade was good if Victor stayed / Dickey in real trouble]]></description>
