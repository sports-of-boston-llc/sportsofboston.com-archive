		<description><![CDATA[your adoration for tebow is hilarious.

not to ruin your parade, predicting gronk won&#039;t make it to playoffs... is that even a prediction?  i feel it&#039;s just a reality, right?  like, we now know he can NOT be counted on for a full season.

although, to always be fair and objective, anyone incurring that play would have ligament damage to their leg, no matter how indestructible he or she believes themselves to be.

no super bowl again... reality bites.

REPLY - MPC - Tebow for PResident / Poor Gronk 18 months of therapy if no deer antler]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[the 1981 eastern championship series was excellent.  But I remember Andrew Toney owned the Celtics, First 5 games he averaged 23.4/game.  5 of 7 games settled by less then 2 points, AMAZING

REPLY - MPC - I say that is the greatest series in Boston sports history followed by Sox-Yankees 2004 / Toney got hurt I think and it slowed him down - Birds first real big shot the banker on a Sunday afternoon]]></description>
