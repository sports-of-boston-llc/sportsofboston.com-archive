		<description><![CDATA[Doesn&#039;t Michigan State win either way? They lose? Rose Bowl bound, if they win, Rose Bowl bound. Big pay day for the Spartans. 

I&#039;ll take Michigan State tomorrow night. Only negative to that game....Gus Johnson will yelling and screaming. 

Will Alabama sneak their way into the BCS Champ. Game if Ohio State and Auburn lose? They could get rewarded for not playing. 

Totally agree with you on your prediction with FSU and Duke. Noles will pound them. 

McCann and Ellsbury have combined to miss more than 250 games in the last three seasons. Is Guidry pitching for NY in 2014?

REPLY - MPC - Red Sox off to a great start and Yankees in panic - perfect / Michigan State boring but efficient coach has done a nice job there]]></description>
