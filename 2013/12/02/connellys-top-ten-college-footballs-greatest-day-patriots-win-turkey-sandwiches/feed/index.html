		<description><![CDATA[So Bobby Orr&#039;s last full season was 1976.  He was 28 years old. Up to that point, he had won three MVP awards and two Stanley Cups.  By the time Wayne Gretzky was 28, he had won NINE MVP awards and four Stanley Cups!  So you are right - it&#039;s not even close.

REPLY - MPC -Gretzky is a one way player who circled the offensive end looking for loose pucks - Orr was physical, fought, the greatest skater of all time, scorer, passer, greatest defender, - gretzky might not even have been the best player on his team of 8-10 Hall of Famers - Orr had Espo - same argument as Montana and Brady - give Brady those receivers he would be at 70,000 yards]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[About Tom Brady&#039;s completion rate, it&#039;s hard to compare this year to 2 years ago - he doesn&#039;t have the receivers he used to. Also, the protection is often inadequate this year compared to 2011, causing him to throw the ball more quickly than he may have planned.

REPLY - MPC - Both fair points]]></description>
