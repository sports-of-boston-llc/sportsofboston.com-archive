		<description><![CDATA[Taking everything into consideration, Chris Jones 80 for 80 defensive snaps and Joe Vellano 71 of 80 defensive snaps are playing pretty good.

Seems quite a few of the injuries are directly related to &quot;turf fields&quot;. Seem guys cleats are getting stuck trying to cut or change direction. 

This could be the worst umpiring crew to ever work a World Series. Awful.

Also, said something similar about Brady being detached from his teammates. Somethings off

REPLY - MPC - I agree on umpiring they can be proud of that effort on biggest stage / turf could be]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ortiz will get the Barry Bonds treatment from the Cardinals, not only tonight, but the rest of the series. 

Peavy and Buchholz had short outings, but they kept their team in the game. 

Doubront has been money the last two games. Does Morales and Dempster bring their gloves to the game? If so, why? 

Great call by Jim Joyce last night. Risky play by Drew, but it paid off. 

Nantz and Simms are brutal. Very boring, and they say nothing. 

No way Cardinals trade Fitzgerald. 

Jared Allen???

REPLY - MPC - I&#039;d take Allen / I don&#039;t mind Nantz and Simms but they are too out of their way down the middle / McCarver and Buck never offered an opinion on the obstruction / Dempster could have nothing on under his sweatsuit if it was baskebtall - I agree good call by Joyce but as a second baseman I&#039;m not pleased with that slide]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i don&#039;t think they are moving rondo.  i would like them to... not sure they will do it.

good turnaround in g4.  red sox are deeper than cardinals, and their lineup seems to gradually wake up as game progresses.

papi will walk 4 times tonight... the lineup needs to show up in full in the 1st inning

REPLY - MPC - they are an amazing come from behind team / Rondo is wasted with no one to feed]]></description>
