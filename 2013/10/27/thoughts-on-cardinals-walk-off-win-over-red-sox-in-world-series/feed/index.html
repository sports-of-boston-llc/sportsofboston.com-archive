		<description><![CDATA[Sorry but noone can clearly see interference unless biased towards St Louis.  The writer stated he was biased, but in looking at the replay, it is clear that Craig &quot;tripped&quot; over Middlebrooks hips which were flat on the ground.  If the flailing legs had tripped Craig, you would be accurate.  A third baseman trying to field a throw on the second base side of third is going to dive to make the play and his body is not going to magically disappear so a runner would not have to avoid him.  The rule may be written so interference &quot;has&quot; to be called, but how many other baseball rules are broken but no calls are made.  The rule needs to be changed so there has to be an intent to obstruct.  Calling obstruction in the bottom of the ninth in the World Series on that play is letting the game be decided by the men in blue and not the players on the field.]]></description>
