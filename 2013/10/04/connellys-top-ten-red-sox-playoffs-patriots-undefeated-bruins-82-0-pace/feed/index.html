		<description><![CDATA[In the Bay Area we have change of seasons just not as dramatic and harsh(thankfully).  Rain instead of snow, leaves change color but not as many trees, 20 ft base powder snow 2.5 hours away in the Sierras (then can easily escape), May through October no rain...every day a picnic day, six pro teams and direct TV gets us lots of exposure to boston sports, 75 member Pats fan club meets in my hometown (Danville)to watch every game and most Sox yanks and playoff games, lobster flown in fresh everyday from New England.  It&#039;s OK I guess.

REPLY - MPC - Its a good gig]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Herald grades for the Sox were a joke.  Glad to see you re-print your 4/1/13 stuff, just shows what an amazing  year they have had.  Agree 100% Lackey is key, but really tough match up Saturday night

REPLY - MPC - they were lucky to get Price on short rest he wasn&#039;t the same pitcher ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[seguin a minus-1 last night and only 2 shots on goal.

a not-so-subtle point of the iginla signing, to me, is to prevent lucic and krejci from coasting as much.  iginla has lost a step, but he was the face of a franchise for a decade plus, so he brings it every night.
