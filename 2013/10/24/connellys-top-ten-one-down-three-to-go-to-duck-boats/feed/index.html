		<description><![CDATA[Could make an argument that Lester has been the most clutch player on this team in the playoffs.  3-1 with 27.0 innings pitched, 22 strikeouts, 1.79 ERA and opponents hitting just .216.  

Having said this, hopefully the pressure gets to rookie Wacha tonight because his playoff numbers have been ridiculous. 

Ever since his solo shot against Detroit, Napoli has hit the ball hard.

REPLY - MPC - Napoli in this lineup is looking like Hank Greenberg / Lester has been money - hope he doesn&#039;t bring the goop to the mound]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is amazing that the umpires can convene to change an obviously erroneous call but can&#039;t see the
green nuclear waste on the webbing of Lester&#039;s glove. Umps got one right and ignored the obvious rules infraction.

REPLY - MPC - with all the cameras could lester be that stupid or desperate or does he know that this is an accepted practice?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Last Red Sox lefty to win a World Series game at Fenway? Bruce Hurst prior to last night. 

Holliday playing in two World Series&#039; games at Fenway for two different teams. I would assume that&#039;s a first at Fenway.

This team capitalizes on every mistake the opposition commits.  Ask TB and Detroit. The sign of a great team. 

How did that umpire miss that call? The drunk in section 1 in the grandstand could see that play. 

Game 2 is a must. You don&#039;t want to go to St. Louis tied up with Peavy (last start vs Detroit was awful) and Buchholz and his iffy shoulder. 

Tonight&#039;s game might be a classic. Very close game. Extra innings?

REPLY - MPC +- you were right on PEavy - ]]></description>
