		<description><![CDATA[Ryne Sandberg is one of the best second basemen I have seen. Resides in Cooperstown. 

Whether you like him or not, Robinson Cano is high on that list. 

I would assume we&#039;ll see Victorino in rf tonight, and Gomes in left. 

Ross looked like Salty on that passed ball in the 8th. Weak attempt by Ross, surprised me. Didn&#039;t expect that from him. 

Remember when Joe Sambito picked off Rickey Henderson at first base to end a game at Fenway? June of 1986, Al Nipper&#039;s first start after his knee injury. 

Matt Holliday got picked off in the World Series, game 2 at Fenway. 

Ortiz is amazing, on the field and off the field. EF Hutton

REPLY - MPC - That Nipper game one the gutiest against Yankees correct / Ross was lazy no to slide over on that / Sandberg one of my favorite players - yes Cano in the conversation]]></description>
