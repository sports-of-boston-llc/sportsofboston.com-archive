		<description><![CDATA[Gonzalez blamed Fenway for his lack of power. Good riddance. Same to Crawford. Glad Boston missed Kershaw. 

Ortiz or Pedroia will probably be the target in NY when they visit there in a couple of weeks. 

Alex Gordon was drafted as a third basemen. Excellent transition. 

UMass playing all homes games in Foxboro. Did they do that last year?

REPLY - MPC - Yes pedroia gets hit / yes foxboro last year - crazy set up for DUI / ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tuna Melt on Sourdough is pretty good at Bickford&#039;s.

Psyched to have college football back.  I hope College Game Day doesn&#039;t follow the rest of ESPN to the left and try to out PC the rest of the world.  I find Outside the Lines unwatchable at this point and The Sports Reporters aren&#039;t far behind.  If they do another feature on gender issues, homosexuality or Title IX, I&#039;m shutting them off forever.

REPLY - MPC - Lee Corso is incapable of going new school ]]></description>
