		<description><![CDATA[Re: &quot;How come it takes five years to fix a bridge and they could erect one in two hours in World War II?&quot;  

I&#039;ve often thought the same thing.  Not to mention, in WWII, the American engineers were often being shot at/bombed by Germans.

REPLY - MPC - Adding to the degree of difficulty]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve definitely seen leaves on the ground up here in NH already.  Love the fall but am not ready to let go of this summer.

My postseason rotation right now would be in this order: Lackey, Peavy, Bucholz (if healthy), Lester.

We were solidiers also a pretty good Vietnam movie.

REPLY - MPC - Wow Lackey first game starter - could be right believe it or not / Fall I wish was all year except for what comes after it / We Were Soliders good solid movie]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Flintstones based on Honeymooners, but nobody could top Jackie G, it&#039;s Ralph. 
Bees can only sting once and then die, hornets win, no contest. 

p.s. When I checked last, Iglesias was 4 for 24 with an OPS of .524 for the Tigers.

REPLY - MPC - Good point on bee ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[off the wall was fading out when i was in elementary school (1990).  c&#039;mon... seriously, the game is technically called &quot;suicide&quot;.  perhaps PC parents made it happen...

apparently they need to call the wambulance in denver and express him back to foxboro.  he obviously regrets making the decision he did, BUT the team forced him to make it.  i blame the pats 60%, if not more, in this whole thing.  the crying / whining now is bizarre, though.  it&#039;s like, get a life...

why so mad, bro?  lester stinks, he&#039;s not pitching in the postseason, let alone the 1-game playoff, if season ended today.

REPLY - MPC - Welker might be the only receiver not to fully regret leaving Brady but there he has to deal with Manning telling you what to do]]></description>
