		<description><![CDATA[Playoff tickets go up in price, not the same as a preseason game. 

Tebow stays, 3rd string qb. Second stringer people should focus on more. What if #12 misses a game or two??? 

1984 BC Eagles at Bama (Legion Field). Best part about that game (other than BC win) was Troy Stratford returning opening kickoff as Bicknell is getting interviewed by Tim Brandt. Oh those were the days. 

For the most part Crawford had a free pass in Boston. 

Eck isn&#039;t afraid in that booth. 

Who wins tomorrow night? Georgia or Clemson? Who&#039;s your Heisman winner? 

Clowney was gassed last night. Too much pressure on him going into this year. Reminds me of Bruce Smith.

REPLY - MPC - Close on Bruce S but a better athlete / I&#039;m not a Clemson fan I think Georgia can make a run and I&#039;m a Murray fan / I remember that game Stratford was great but not that - that is old school]]></description>
