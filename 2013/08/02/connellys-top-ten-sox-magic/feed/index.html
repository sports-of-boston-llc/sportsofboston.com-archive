		<description><![CDATA[**Liked your electric list.  
- Bird #3
- Yaz did it all in 67
- Tony C on his way (hard for position players to make the list)
- Rondo? What have you done with Michael? He does belong!
**As a lifelong Boston sports fan but transplanted to Calif I hate that CSNNE blacks out specials like the Reggie Lewis one.  I pay for the DTV sports channels.  Why not black out Tanquay and give me Reggie.  What do they gain by blacking me out?
**RIP Boomer!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gronk is not soft but he sure is injury prone. He has played through some tough injuries and that isn&#039;t the definition of &quot;soft.&quot; Agree with tronburger, brittle.

REPLY - MPC - What is the definition - ability to stay on the field? recover fast? Won&#039;t play with injury? All to interpretation - worthy of both sides]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Calling Bonds a &quot;rumored juicer&quot; is like calling Lenin a &quot;rumored Communist!&quot;

Nice to see some of those names on the electric list, and agree with the top two, but I have to say Bird is No. 3.

REPLY - MPC - Bird I weighed and electric to me was fast and immediatley exciting - I would say Bird&#039;s amazing play made the crowd electric - arguement could be made either way / By the way wasn&#039;t Lenin a Marxist]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[-What&#039;s your definition of &quot;electric?&quot;  No Bird?
-Best Eagles song is an oxymoron.
-Papelbon 6th blown save.  I wonder if someone said &quot;We didn&#039;t sign you for this...&quot;
-Luis Tiant stats on pitches thrown, innings, thrown, complete games.  I cannot get enough of them.  My all-time fav, those were the days when ballplayers were ballplayers for me.  
-RIP Boomer indeed.  Another throw back guy that I loved! 
-Thanks to Seattle acting Manager Robby Thompson for last night! Can&#039;t recall seeing that before.

rEPLY - MPC - hope Eric Wedge wasnt watching - Phillies can sure say that / not a huge Eagles fan / you know I love Bird - I think he made the crowd electric with amazing feats but not end to end ice rushes like Orr]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Morales broke his leg with the Angels during a walkoff a few years back. 

Boston leads baseball with 11 walkoffs this year. 

Tito and his Tribe are having some exciting wins. Most overlooked team in baseball. 

Braves signed Upton to 75 million/5 years. TB hasn&#039;t missed a beat since he left. In fact, they&#039;re better without him. 

Morgan Magic, insane season. Will Peavy have a Boddicker impact? 

Papelbon rips apart the Phillies organization and then blows another save. Look in the mirror Papelbon.

REPLY - MPC - Boddicker was great addition worth the Brady Anderson and Schilling / Papelbon in big trouble - he should shut it down for six months / good point on Tampa and Upton]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[in what terms do you define &quot;soft&quot;?  i only ask because i truly don&#039;t think gronk is mentally soft, as you could make the case of for the ilk of the drews, buchholz, never nervous pervis and tony eason.

gronk&#039;s body is clearly somewhat brittle, but i do think he&#039;s tough.  he played in that SB and gave them pretty much everything he had with a severe ankle injury.  he missed the ravens game because his arm broke.  i mean, these aren&#039;t &quot;soft&quot; injuries... a la buchholz&#039;s, what... stiff neck???

that clemens thing was really strange.  like... so under the radar odd... then he gives a press conference???  bizarre move by Sox allowing him a forum.

REPLY - MPC - I agree on your Gronk thoughts - soft is a stretch in the sense he wants to be out there - problem is is that he isn&#039;t ]]></description>
