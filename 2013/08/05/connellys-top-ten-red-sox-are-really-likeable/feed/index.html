		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think Iglesias played 128 games for the Sox at SS in 2012, wasn&#039;t he still in Pawtucket for most of that season?

		<description><![CDATA[-Yes, white flag on A-Rod &#038; Manziel.
-Why do they throw the balls out after every pitch in the dirt, etc.  Waste, plus if you are a pitcher don&#039;t you want the dirtier ball?  
-Pitch clock would be radical (for baseball) but they have to do something.
-Can&#039;t leave the box is likely the first thing to come.  
-Corona is a bad beer, bad...

REPLY - MPC - Corona is a summer, outside beer - marketing has got me / ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agree about Gibson. He walks as if he is 70 years old. All Star coaching staff the D&#039;Backs have. 

How are the Diamondbacks in playoff contention? Weak lineup with okay pitching. Goldschmidt their only threat. 

Cody Ross had revenge on his mind Friday night. 

Boston should score at least 30 runs vs Houston during this 3 game series. 

Victorino on fire. 

Iglesias homered on Sat. night. 

I&#039;ve had enough of Manziel. Awesome player to watch. He has a personal asst. He&#039;s a walking train wreck. 

Not sold on the Red Sox bullpen before Koji.

REPLY - MPC - Ross still mad - he is overpaid as is / Victorino was picked as worst free agent signing]]></description>
