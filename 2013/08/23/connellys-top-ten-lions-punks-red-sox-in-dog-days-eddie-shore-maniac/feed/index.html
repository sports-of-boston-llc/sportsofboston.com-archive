		<description><![CDATA[Pac Bell looks great. Must get there someday. 

Big series this weekend in St. Pete. Yankees vs Rays. A few weeks back I counted out NY, they were hovering around .500

Girardi manager of the year? 

Joey Gathright (cup of coffee with the Red Sox) was really fast. 

Lackey&#039;s ERA is excellent. Lack of run support, but he&#039;s not an ace.

Murray vs Boyd at Clemson, first game of the year. Points and more points that night.]]></description>
