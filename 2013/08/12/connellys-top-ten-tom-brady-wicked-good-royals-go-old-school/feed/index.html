		<description><![CDATA[i went to a pawsox game, and loved it. sat out in left, and we were surrounded by nice kids with gloves trying to snag homers and long fouls. knowledgeable fans, who liked good baseball at an affordable price. nothing in Pawtucket baseball not to love. The park felt like a big league park, only tiny.

REPLY - MPC - I agree - I usually go every year - just a random location  to pick]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ellsbury will look good with the Rangers. 

Guidry blew away everyone that year. Rice was great in 1978 but he couldn&#039;t solve Guidry that year if memory serves correct. 

Eagles D looked brutal. Huge holes for the NE running backs. 

Next college coach to jump into the NFL? David Shaw? Bill O&#039;Brien? 

Cabrera is by far the best hitter I have ever seen. Putting up bigger numbers this year than last year, and he won the Triple Crown last year. 

 FYI: Jose Veras got traded to Detroit prior to the trading deadline.

REPLY - MPC - Imagine if Cabrera didn&#039;t throw a couple of years away with bad attitude and drinking? I&#039;m a big David Shaw fan / Eagles defense embarrassing]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[recently went to a pawsox game for work!  good take.  sleepy town, yep.

it is amazing the lack of progress that tebow has made in 4 years at the pro level.  i could deal with his accuracy (or lack thereof), but the abandonment of his progressions / reads is too much.  will he ever get better...?  NO.

REPLY - MPC - I agree in Paw Sox is a good take / And no one is a bigger Tebow fan than me but that was embarrassing Pop Warner stuff]]></description>
