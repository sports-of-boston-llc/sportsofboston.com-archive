		<description><![CDATA[If Dempster is going to throw at ARod because he&#039;s a cheater, doesn&#039;t Dempster have to do that to all the cheaters? Pick and choose mentality, don&#039;t like that. 

If you&#039;re going to throw at him, nail him with the first pitch. 

Ironic that Dempster is involved because he is having a &quot;charity race&quot; with Yankee reliever David Robertson. 

Nunez always running around without his helmet. 

Red Sox get lucky this weekend vs LA, no Kershaw and Grienke. 

Will Beltre make the Hall of Fame? Putting up some big numbers and is tremendous at third. 

I cannot believe the year Loney is having at the plate. I didn&#039;t think he would hit above .280 this year. He has one of the best if not the best road average in baseball.

REPLY - MPC - I agree on Loney I would have never kept him - Beltre definitely in (juicer?) / Dodgers - Giants is fun tour]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wish umps had thrown Dempster out. Sox might have won. Or that Farrell had hooked him when he should have in the sixth, after the ARod homer, or at least when the lefty hitter came up with a runner on first after that. No way should Dempster have faced that batter.

REPLY - MPC - I remember a day time playoff game against Cleveland and the Sox were lighting up Gooden and he got tossed and the other guy came in and shut them down (Brantley maybe)]]></description>
