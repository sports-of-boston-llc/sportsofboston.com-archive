		<description><![CDATA[Good mention of the great sports movie Bang the Drum Slowly. It was always my favorite, with Michael Morrison (also great on Law &#038; Order) and Robert DeNiro as the slow witted dying catcher. I was at my mother-in-law&#039;s house quite a few years ago, and they played an Old U.S. Steel Hour live (long before) Bang the Drum Slowly, starring Paul Newman and a lot of very good character actors. It was made during the 1950s, and held up well.

REPLY - MPC - The score is a great version of Bang the Drum Slowly also]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I always liked North Dallas Forty, good football film.

No on the Revis deal. I think his frequent injuries and contract squabbles detract from his overall value to a team.

REPLY - MPC - He would have to play ball and buy in - Gronk hurt again since this morning - infection]]></description>
