		<description><![CDATA[Hey, Michael,

I&#039;d have to say that the red-winged black bird is # 3.  Nice screech, too.  Too bad we don&#039;t see any Baltimore Orioles around.

REPLY - MPC - Excellent, see a lot of Red Tail Hawks around and saw Condors in Grand Canyon]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; Snow again – Al Gore in the house anyone? Oh he’s getting a massage

Measuring global warming by only counting the coldest days in the year is not good sportsmanship--it&#039;s sorta like playing football and only counting your own touchdowns. If you can&#039;t play the game fairly, then don&#039;t play it at all.

REPLY - MPC - Did you like my massage comment (you know what that means -right?)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two comments
#1 (not a great list after three)

Easy Ed McCauley is in the hall of fame.

#2 Coaches in the hall of fame

KC Jones,Bill Russell,Tom Sanders, Dave Cowens and Tom Heinsohn

Don&#039;t be lazy Michael

REPLY - MPC - Thank goodness you are here to police the Top Ten - you need to stop being lazy (ya take that) the literal topic on those in the Hall of Fame said coaches not players. KC, Russell Sanders, Cowens and Heinsohn are in as players - so read more carefully before you spend the time to reprimand / Easy Ed went on to win his championship in St. Louis after getting traded for Russell but I&#039;ll grant you his time in Boston was worthy of more attention. ]]></description>
