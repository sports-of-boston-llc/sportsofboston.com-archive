		<description><![CDATA[Didn&#039;t Jordan not even attempt or make a 3 in that game?  Something like that... maybe 1 max.

Instead of the 5 Year Engagement, I negotiated to watch The Switch, which was dark-ish and somewhat passable.  Glad I won that battle of the rom-coms.

In order to jump the shark, don&#039;t you have to be able to jump?  I severely dislike everything about Bass&#039;s game.  Not my cup of coffee.

REPLY - MPC - It was the real Jordan coming out party. He had one basket where he went between his legs three times and stuck a 18 footer in Bird&#039;s face]]></description>
