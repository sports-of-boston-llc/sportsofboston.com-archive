		<description><![CDATA[Mike Salk has been fantastic here in Seattle. Boston getting a guy who knows his sports, can listen, trash talk, bring outside-the-box considerations, and make you laugh, yell, boo, and enjoy. Good luck, Mike!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The dude is a CLOWN! I stopped listeining to him and Holley a long time ago. Worst combo to put together on Sports talk radio. All they do is try to yell over eachother, both think they are ALWAYS right, and belittle every caller like no fan has a clue about Sports. Glad to see Felger and Mazz are owning those jabronis.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was a faithful listener of the B Show for most of Glenn&#039;s career and it is sad to see it end, despite admittingly changing to 98.5 after 10am the past 2 years.  I will always appreciate the show grow and coincide with the success of the Patriots particularly from the Parcells&#039; years going forward.  Many good memories and wish Glenn well with his future endeavors.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When a sports talk show host forgets that he is after all running a talk show, which is by definition designed to  encourage an exchange with listeners, and you do nothing but belittle and make fun of callers, you deserve to be fired. Arrogant and steadfast in stupid ideas best describes Glen Ordway.

Felger, make note!!]]></description>
