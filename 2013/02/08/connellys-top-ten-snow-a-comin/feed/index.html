		<description><![CDATA[Hello there! This article couldn&#039;t be written much better! Going through this article reminds me of my previous roommate! He constantly kept preaching about this. I am going to forward this information to him. Pretty sure he will have a good read. Thank you for sharing!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gronk is not doing drugs, getting in fights, drunk driving, raping women, or otherwise breaking the law.  He&#039;s just having some harmless fun, and most of us are having fun along with him. Viva la Fiesta!

REPLY - MPC - I had commented on him before Super Bowl that the fact he can&#039;t stay on the field and his injuries have cost the Patriots two Super Bowls - all the more reason to stay low profile. I agree as far aw we know drugs, fights and other mischief aren&#039;t occurring but ask Derek Lowe, Vin Baker, Mickey Mantle, Derek Sanderson, etc about the drinking thing and party circuit beat them up over time ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Timmy embarrassed the team by refusing to go on the trip to the White House. That to me is enough to boo him for all eternity.

REPLY - MPC - I agree he was a bad teammate on that day - but with that said his crazy run to the Stanley Cup is one of the great runs (yaz 1967) in Boston sports history giving us an amazing two plus months - for that he should be thanked]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would have more respect for Thomas if he signed with Montreal when his contract was up.
He quit on the team that gave him a chance in the NHL.
Damon &#038; Vinatieri never quit on their team.

B&#039;s-Buffalo was game 7. (remember it well) I almost jumped through the ceiling.

REPLY - MPC - I&#039;ll cheer for him - he&#039;s nutty but the run he went on was a thrill for Boston / Park&#039;s goal was preceeded by Danny Ainge getting bit by Tree Rollins]]></description>
