		<description><![CDATA[This kid is a special player and if his back allows, he&#039;ll be a great addition to the Celtics.  I&#039;ve been living in fear that Ainge would trade him away as part of a big deal, but now that he&#039;s injured he&#039;ll probably not be as desirable to other teams.  That&#039;s a good break for the Celts, but a bad break for a really good kid.  I would be really pissed off if Ainge trades him!]]></description>
