		<description><![CDATA[Anyone else think the GoDaddy.com commercial was a little much also?

Jerry York is one of the FEW things that is right not only in college athletics but sports in general.

Am interested to read Francona book, but am annoyed that he chose Shaughnessy to co-write it.

REPLY - MPC - I was uncomfortable watching - considering the fact that she wouldn&#039;t even look at that kid never mind french kiss him but she was paid so that makes her a relative prostitute / yes on York / I will get Francona book - lot of money they are making]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Halftime show was a complete disgrace. I also had to turn it off because of my children. The NFL should be ashamed of themselves and it was icing on the cake for the Ray Lewis hero worship bowl. They have done a great job as a league marketing the game, but I question their thought process (or lack thereof)of late.

Reply - mpc - $$$$$$$$ - thats all they care about - was Roger Goodele sitting with that little kid during the Cabaret act?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i just boycott every halftime show because i know it&#039;s awful, horrid stuff.  the fantasy land that these music stars perpetuate is vapid.  we went old school, and had a pacman tourney at halftime.

brady &#062;&#062;&#062;&#062;&#062;&#062; flacco... it&#039;s not close, please don&#039;t intimate that flacco is anything but an above average QB that got hot this year.

REPLY - MPC - Yes pacman - brady is much better than Flacco but its closer than it was and Flacco has to be moved up to top 7]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had more of a problem with the Calvin Klein underwear commercial minutes into the 1st quarter than the Beyonce show. What happened to the Victoria&#039;s Secret commercials?

REPLY - MPC - I missed that one - thank God. Its legit a PG 13 broadcast]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Could not agree more on the halftime show.  It is a disgrace that the NFL decides that is what they want to put on during halftime of their flagship program.  I had to shut it off so that my young kids wouldn&#039;t think that that&#039;s how girls should dress and act.

I thought that the clydesdale commercial was really good and I loved the Doge truck commercial with the Paul Harvey commentary about farmers.

I gained respect for Boomer when he questioned Ray Lewis&#039;s answer to his suck up interview with Shannon Sharpe.  I don&#039;t think that saying &quot;God doesn&#039;t make mistakes&quot; answers the victim&#039;s families&#039; questions.

REPLY - MPC - As usual on the same page]]></description>
