		<description><![CDATA[Um, great defensive plays in Boston history, might have missed one, Mike! &quot;Havlicek steals it. Over to Sam Jones. Havlicek stole the ball! It&#039;s all over! Johnny Havlicek stole the ball!&quot; 
Also worth considering, McGinest comes in off the left edge to stuff Marshall Faulk inside the five in I believe the 2003 AFC title game.

REPLY - MPC - Definitely Havlicek - McGinest big play not sure if top ten]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s hard to see how the five pro bowls Marcus Allen went to as a member of the Oakland Raiders are relevant to an evaluation of Joe Montana. Same applies to the six pro bowls Jerry Rice was selected for after Montana left SF. If you are going to count those, then you need to count the five pro bowls Randy Moss played in before he joined the Patriots.  As for Christian Okoye - he and Montana were never teammates!  So the correct count of the number of pro bowlers Joe Montana threw passes to is eleven, same as Brady. 

Montana - with his 95.6 postseason passer rating - is still in the conversation, and it is unreasonable to expect him of all people to admit otherwise.

REPLY - MPC - I will give you some of Rice&#039;s pro bowls and Okyoe but Allen&#039;s I only gave him credit for one when he was with Montana in KC / I think the point is - Give Brady Rice, Taylor, Craig, Clark and the 49ers liberal use of the salary cap and it would have been fun to watch - he has Moss for one year and it was the greatest WR / QB combo ever - yes Montana is in the conversation - &quot;Brady is greatest / Montana used to be&quot;]]></description>
