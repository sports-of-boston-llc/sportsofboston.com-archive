		<description><![CDATA[-Why should Houston be embarrassed?  What were they supposed to do, not show up.  Pats have been beating 2nd string QBs all season.  
-Wow, great stat on Russell&#039;s rebounding.  We seem to start considering someone a good rebounder when they average 6-8 now.  
-Schilling&#039;s an idiot, but agree with Cafardo. Can&#039;t understand why people can&#039;t look at things mutually exclusively anymore.  
-Lehane just lost some love.

reply-mpc-embarrassed wrong word - maybe not put much value in the win - it was a bad team Saturday]]></description>
