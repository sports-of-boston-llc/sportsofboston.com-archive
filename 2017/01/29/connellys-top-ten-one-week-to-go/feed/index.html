		<description><![CDATA[Good catch on Nadal&#039;s watch.  Can&#039;t for the life of me understand why he does it.  I suppose if it were a cheap Timex, but I bet it&#039;s not.  You are absolutely correct to remind us of how lucky we are to be Boston sports fans.  I wonder who will be next after Brady.  Maybe we&#039;ve seen the last icon.  That would be too bad.

REPLY - MPC - The next Brady might be Brady at this rate]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Any hockey list that doesn&#039;t put Orr at No. 1 is full of Zamboni shavings. Career per game +/- of .91 is at least a third of a goal higher than any other player. Larry Robinson is No. 2. Gretzy is No. 5, if I recall, at 0.47. You could make a career value argument because Orr&#039;s was cut short due to injury, but at his best nobody was close. These stats don&#039;t break it down per game, but a little quick math and you&#039;ll get the point: http://www.quanthockey.com/nhl/records/nhl-players-all-time-plus-minus-leaders.html

reply - mpc - I agree - if you know the game you realize that gretzky isn&#039;t close - he played one way and had the greatest cast since Joe Montana - his game makes him top five but not top]]></description>
