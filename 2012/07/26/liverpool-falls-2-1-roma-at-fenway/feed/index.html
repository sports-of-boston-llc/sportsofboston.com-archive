		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d beg to differ on some of the analysis. Of the Liverpool XI, there was probably three players who will start on opening day: Carragher, Skrtel and Enrique. Cole, Aquliani and others are on the fringe still. That being said, even though Roma had the control of play, it was still 0-0 at half. Not only did Roma have several starters playing, but they&#039;ve also played three or four more games this preseason than Liverpool, which plays a big part.

And it&#039;s LUIS Suarez. 

And I surely hope you aren&#039;t making season predictions based on a friendly. Man United lost 8-2 in a friendly last year and they did fairly well in the regular season.

This day wasn&#039;t about the result, or how the teams played. What I&#039;ll remember is marching via police escort to Fenway with hundreds of Liverpool fans singing the famous anthems and the sold out, electric crowd that watched an exhibition match.]]></description>
