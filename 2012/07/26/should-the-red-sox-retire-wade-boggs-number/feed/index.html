		<description><![CDATA[@Aryeh: I&#039;m not going to dishonor or second guess numbers that have already been retired--I wasn&#039;t there when they played. To answer your other question, switching teams doesn&#039;t discredit everything you&#039;ve already done, but it does prevent you from earning the final credits you would need to have your number retired.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Alan:

Fisk chose to go elsewhere - does that mean that #27 shouldn&#039;t be retired? What about Pesky, who played with the Tigers and Senators? If a player is offered more money to switch teams or the team he is currently on is terrible and he decides to switch teams, why does that discredit everything he did with his former club?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I mostly agree with the Red Sox criteria.  Boggs has a lot of honors and accolades, but retiring his number should not be one of them because he chose to go elsewhere.  It doesn&#039;t matter that it was the Yankees--it matters that he left the Red Sox in the middle of his career and played for many more years for other teams.  Pedro should also be excluded from having his number retired for the same reason, as well as Tek, since he won&#039;t make the HOF. There should in the end be very few numbers retired, and the criteria should be very strict. Many great players won&#039;t make it, and that is the way it should be. You have to be very, very, very special to have your number retired.]]></description>
