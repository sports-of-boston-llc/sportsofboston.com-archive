		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Baltimore Orioles are the only team in baseball that have scored less runs than given up, but are over .500&quot;
Fun fact: The 1987 World Series champion Twins scored 786 runs in the regular season, allowed 806. Like the Cards more recently, they won a lame division and then got hot.

The old networks can&#039;t compete in the Emmys for dramas because they aren&#039;t allowed the same level of adult content as the cable networks. 

&quot;The Watch&quot; is about watch yokels dealing with an alien invasion and was finished before the Zimmerman/Martin murder, BTW. No parallels.

REPLY - MPC - Fair point on Cable TV latitutude but still interesting - good note on 1987 Twins]]></description>
