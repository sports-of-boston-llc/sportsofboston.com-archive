		<description><![CDATA[The cop is not racist.  Funny how everyone is so quick to judge him but no one knows him or went to the hearing to see that the city had absolutely no proof of anything.  He will sue the city and he will win.  He is a good cop and a good person.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cmon use your head.  The cop knew what it meant and that&#039;s all that counts.  So if he yelled out a racial slur in Spanish and nobody understood what he said does that make it ok?   Of course not. And FYI  Crawford knew what it meant.  It&#039;s been an unwritten word amongst some police officers for minorities for years.  Sorry you didn&#039;t know that. 
And sorry for calling you a racist.  It&#039;s just makes me sick every time a see a cop abuse his powers.  He makes all good cops look bad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Really? I&#039;m a racist? All I&#039;m saying is that nobody knows what that means, including the author of this article until he looked it up on Urban Dictionary. Also, Crawford himself said after the game with Portland that a fan yelled stuff at him. When you&#039;re a baseball player, you&#039;re trained to ignore thousands of people yelling your name, but Crawford felt the need to bring up the incident. I don&#039;t think Crawford should have mentioned it at all in the first place.]]></description>
