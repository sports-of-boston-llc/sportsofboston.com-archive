		<description><![CDATA[avoid those weird potato chips in the vending machine... on occasion, they&#039;ll throw a cracked pepper and salt bag in there.  makes me sneeze.

TDKR is best of the year&#039;s action movies, but Avengers will take the total box office.

i was dead wrong on mccutchen.  all the stat geeks in my league raved about him and he&#039;s now a top-3 candidate for MVP.

i remember phil nevin... lol.  he had some pop for a while...

REPLY - MPC - I was wrong on McCuthen also. Nevin have real pop or manufactured?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What exactly are you going to get for Ellsbury, who has played all of 19 games this year? You&#039;re not going to get anything near what Ellsbury is worth until next year&#039;s deadline, assuming he stays healthy.

REPLY - MPC - Ellsbury is a top five positional player in the league when healthy - some crazy GM will look at last year and not the top three. I would take - Gerrit Cole from Pittsburgh, Devon Mesoraco from Reds, Jacob Turner from Tigers]]></description>
