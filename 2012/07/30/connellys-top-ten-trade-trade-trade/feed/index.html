		<description><![CDATA[Aceves&#039; and Papelbon&#039;s stats are eerily similar - look it up - except for one thing: Papelbon is making about $11 million more this season. 

Funny thing about living in VT: We watched US-USSR hockey live at noon on Canadian television. Many in the northern states knew many hours before the rest of the country. Weather still could be better, though.

REPLY - MPC - I think Theo said on the way out - big splash free agents arent&#039; the way to go - Just think if you took Crawford and LAckey&#039;s money at $40mm and poured that into players you could lure into MLB in the draft. Your system would be insane / interested on the 1980 game - did not know that]]></description>
