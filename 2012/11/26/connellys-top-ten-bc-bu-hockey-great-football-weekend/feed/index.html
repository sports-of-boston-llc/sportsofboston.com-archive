		<description><![CDATA[How unfortunate that this has been such a topic.  Keep up the good work.  You have our support!  Now, a better story is your accusation that the boys in the league ofice are plotting to keep the pat&#039;s out of the top two spots just for TV money. ;-)

REPLY - MPC - Could the PAtriots be better off staying active and not sitting?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ditto what Dave H said. 
Alan, This is what racism looks like. &quot;The Cambridge Police Acted Stupidly&quot;. Obama opening his pie hole, hours after his black friend was arrested. To hell with any facts! 
You want to see what a real racist looks like? He&#039;s living at 1600 Pennsylvania Av. 
I despise Obama not because I&#039;m a racist but because he is! 
Keep up the good work Michael!

REPLY - MPC - Thanks for the support - we&#039;ll let Alan have his say - not because he&#039;s right but because it is his right. I guess this is what makes the world spin and counter spin differing of opinions and perspectives. I&#039;m sitll mad at the Fenway Group for signing Lebron to a contract. ]]></description>

Was about to post a very similar thought, but you beat me to the punch.  Very unfortunate to take a very entertaining site and try to manufacture an issue where it clearly does not exist.

		<description><![CDATA[Alan, do you really need to insinuate racism here?  I&#039;ve read every blog as well and find it ridiculous that you would go there. I guess that we should all tap dance around for the rest of time lest we offend someone who is likely trolling for an offense. 

MPC, I know what you meant. Keep up the good work. You give a lot of people something to look forward to a couple if times a week

		<description><![CDATA[MPC, Don&#039;t blame me for what you wrote. As a writer, you should be apologizing for making the mistake, not blaming me. And if you think I should have been able to correct your mistake myself based on what you have written over the last year, then you clearly have a misperception of your own writing.

REPLY - MPC - Everyone reads and hears things out of their own lens -thats your perogative to interpret as you see fit but even with the word &quot;he&quot; out of the phrase your lens is tired and outdated - I recommend an upgrade.    ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[MPC, I have read every one of your Top Ten&#039;s at Sports of Boston, since your very first last year.

REPLY - MPC - Then you should know better - I have never ever commented in that direction or even used sarcasm or humor in that direction. Surprised you would even think in those terms. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; Lebron James twitter handle is really King James â€“ boy is happy with himself

Where did you grow up, in the Deep South?  Do you really thinks it&#039;s appropriate to call Lebron James a &quot;boy&quot;?

REPLY - MPC - To be honest the word &quot;he&quot; was supposed to be in front of happy. Interested if you read the top ten blog often or seldom - if often you would have interpreted that phrase one way - if seldom I think that speaks to your perception more than mine]]></description>
