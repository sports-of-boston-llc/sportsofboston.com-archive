		<description><![CDATA[Sorry but your account of what Tebow did as a Bronco, is dead wrong. 

As you pointed out Tebow was atrocious at times, and I&#039;m with our former QB Jake Plummer (The Tom Brady Killer) in that I would like him more without the religious outbursts.

What Tebow did very badly under John Fox as a HC was the short passing/screen plays that he did so well in 2010 under the McDaniels regime.

What all the haters fail to acknowledge is how incredibly effective he was when he needed to go into hurry up situations and winging it. His deep passing skills are actually very good - especially with the element of surprise he always bring.

What the Tebow haters also fail to acknowledge is the improvement in the running game for the backs when he is the starter. Denver saw Willis McGahee increase his average length per carry by almost 50% with Tebow as the QB over Orton.

Haters that love the Cam Newton&#039;s, Sam Bradford&#039;s of this world, need to also acknowledge that winning football games is a very mental thing - John Elway threw fantastic passes - as did Cutler for us. What made Elway exceptional and Cutler mediocre was the same drive/leadership that Tebow has. 

He could easily be the right answer for the Jets.]]></description>
