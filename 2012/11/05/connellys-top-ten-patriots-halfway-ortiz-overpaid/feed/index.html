		<description><![CDATA[Re: Ortiz &quot;he earned it years ago&quot;...if I may, I&#039;d like to introduce a little reality into the discussion...if that is your logic should DiceK, Carl Crawford, and John Lackey give their salary back to the Red Sox for prior years? Additionally, the period in which you claim he &quot;earned it&quot; was a time when the Red Sox took a chance on him and he was clearly on the juice during some or all of those years (take an objective look at the numbers). He&#039;s been great to watch and thrown up huge performances in the clutch but you can&#039;t pay him for past at bats.

REPLY - MPC - Using the theory of past performance means we should re-attach Ted&#039;s head and prop him up in the batters box]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually, Asante Samuel became a starter after Law and Poole were sidelined by injuries in 2004, and had an interception in the end zone that was called back in Super Bowl 39.

REPLY - MPC - Show me the money - which should mean show me some run support]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[-I think the Sox bad clubhouse was too messy for one man to turnaround, especially with Bobby V at the helm.  I wouldn&#039;t fault Ortiz for that. 

-Celtics rebounding, or lack thereof, means the rook Sullinger has to grow up very fast.  Remember we discussed getting Camby while you were at the Herald during there last title run? We would have won it with him! 

-Steelers over Giants every day.  

-LSUs prevent defense down the stretch against Alabama. Unreal that coaches go to this almost every time.

REPLY - MPC - Camby was right / LSU was sad loss - parking lot must have been somber / Sull has a chance to be Rookie of the Year but won&#039;t be a force in defensive paint (though taking charges)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I disagree, it&#039;s a good call to bring him back. They need his bat in the lineup and so what if it&#039;s for more money than he might produce for, he earned it years ago. Plus who else thats a free agent should we use that money on??? He is the best choice.

REPLY - MPC - I know its not money but why overpay when no one else we give him 75% of the money]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree totally on Ortiz.  He is 37 years old and overweight, has a PED history and an Achilles injury.  What a bad bet.  I think he has only about a 50% chance of hitting another 20 homers as a Red Sox.

REPLY - MPC - Unless he ponies up with a chemist again]]></description>

REPLY - MPC - Like the Patriots not getting a pass rush in the offseason every year  - Celtics not getting a rebounder (why not Marcus Camby)]]></description>
