		<description><![CDATA[CW,

Players who are at or over the age of 23 with three years of service time playing in a professional league, which Diaz has done for Cuba and now Mexico, makes him eligible to bypass MLB&#039;s new international free agent signing policies. I believe that players will be getting grandfathered into the new rules this year, so Diaz would slip through the cracks in a loophole.
