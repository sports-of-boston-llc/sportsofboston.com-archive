		<description><![CDATA[With the women in your life (wife, mother, sisters...) how could you think that the girls were not aware of a bi-week? Some of us are going through withdrawals too without a Pats game too... and no sign of the Bruins on the horizon.

REPLY - MPC - Some woman said bye week means &quot;BUY&quot; week]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You really think what Rondo did was insane? Hard foul yes...punk move? No. How aboout Wade pretty much ripping off Rondo&#039;s arm and injuring his elbow? I&#039;m not a big Rondo fan but enough of the double standards already.....Wade is a bigger punk than Rondo.

REPLY - MPC - No I had no problem with that play - him in general I think he is on the ledge all the time]]></description>
