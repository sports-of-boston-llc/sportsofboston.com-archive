		<description><![CDATA[Jerry when I write that I don&#039;t necessarily mean with Vegas.  The Pats will probably be the favorite, especially IF they are 7-3 and the Jets are 4-6.  But if the Jets are 5-5 and the Patriots are 6-4 it will close.  Vegas isn&#039;t always about who they think will win, its about where they want the money to go.  If the Pats were going to New York next week, I would put the Jets as a slight favorite. This is just me picking the game. Tom Brady struggles against Rex Ryan, Sanchez had his only good game against the Pats and with the exception of last year, the Patriots have not played well in NY during the Ryan era.  Also, that game is going to be the Jets Super Bowl so they will leave it all on the field. And finally, a short week of prep for the Pats.]]></description>
