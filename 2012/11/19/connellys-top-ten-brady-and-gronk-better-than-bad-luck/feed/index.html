		<description><![CDATA[This should be Gil Santos&#039; last year.  I loved him when I was a kid, but he probably should have stepped away from the mic about 5-7-years ago. 

He&#039;s been blowing calls for a long time now. In the 2007 Super Bowl, he said Manning was sacked on the David Tyree catch. On 4th &#038; 2 against Indy in 2009, he said the receiver was Wes Welker - it was Kevin Faulk.  I like Zolak, so I occasionally turn on 98.5 while watching.  It&#039;s like watching a completely different game then what is on TV.  

Gil still has a great voice, but I think he now has serious sight issues. I&#039;m not saying that to be funny, but his calls are now ridiculously inaccurate

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The streak&quot; is indeed remarkable as you point out.  Do you think Kraft encourages or even somehow requires the networks to show him on the telecasts?

REPLY - MPC - Its insane - he is the head of TV for the NFL if I&#039;m not mistaken

		<description><![CDATA[i was wrong on the game, myself.  what a blowout.

gronk injury is not a season ender, but it likely puts them in wild card weekend, not divisional round with a bye.  jax couldn&#039;t pull off the upset, hou still has no conference losses.  den has the easiest schedule in the nfl to close.

REPLY - MPC - Thats a downer]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You forgot to mention who was sitting beside Kraft - Henry Kissinger!  WTF?  One week we see Bob with a 28-year-old bikini model; the next week with an 89-year-old war criminal!

REPLY - MPC - I thought that was him. I didn&#039;t focus in on him as I was more concerned about the streak staying alive]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Luck had more yards than Brady because the turnovers kept putting the Patriots closer to the endzone... or not even back on the field after a defensive TD! Tom and the offense are well rested for a short week
