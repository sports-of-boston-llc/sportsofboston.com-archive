		<description><![CDATA[Woah! I&#039;m really digging the template/theme of this blog. It&#039;s simple, yet effective.
A lot of times it&#039;s very hard to get that &quot;perfect balance&quot; between usability and appearance. I must say you&#039;ve done a 
superb job with this. Also, the blog loads extremely fast 
for me on Firefox. Outstanding Blog!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[By the time the Red Sox get down to business all the options will be gone. Now the talk coming from no-news Fenway is that Ben would like to talk to Pedroia about an extention. Are you kidding me? When they come back from the winter meetings we will here about all the solid ground work they accomplished and how they have all winter for deals to come to fruition. They are the worst team in the division. 2013 has LAST PLACE written all over it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike Napoli natural position is catcher, he can play first base but he lacks of movement around the base makes him a bad defender a first. I don&#039;t think his is the best option at first base for Boston. Mr Cherington should trade for Kendrys Morales, he is good hitter, he can hit for average and has power, with a decent glove.

DMac- I agree with you. Kendrys Morales was one of my top choices in a previous article]]></description>
