		<description><![CDATA[Re: &quot;Boardwalk Empire off to a slow start.&quot;
 
What?  You&#039;re not fascinated by the story-line involving Margaret &#038; her charity work?  You know, it really makes her feel empowered.  Yawn.  This is what happens when you create a huge hole in the show when you kill half the show with the killing off of Jimmy Darmody.

REPLY - MPC - Raw milk is an issue]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[if bradley can get healthy, he&#039;ll move up that ranking from ESPN next year.  never thought i&#039;d be a believer in bradley, but you can&#039;t ignore how he and rondo were destroying teams defensively last year.  it really was beautiful.

REPLY - MPC - The fact that he developed a jump shot changed everything]]></description>
