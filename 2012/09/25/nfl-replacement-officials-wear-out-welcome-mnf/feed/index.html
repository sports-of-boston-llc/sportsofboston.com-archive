		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re a players guy in every sense of the word. You have a problem with owners trying to line their pockets with as much money as possible, but think it&#039;s OK for the players or refs to line their pockets. Doesn&#039;t seem right to me. 

I&#039;ve read several blogs that are pushing for the NFL players to go on strike until the &quot;real Refs&quot; are back. I would love to see that. Solidarity! No football ha ha. Of course that will never happen because the NFLPA only looks out for its self. Not you, not me, not the fans and certainly not the refs. I&#039;m done!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While the owners may take a financial risk, they make all their money off the players who are on the field every week. In that sense yes I am a &quot;players guy.&quot; 

The owners money is apparent when you have Jerry Jones having people wipe his glasses for him. While the raise to the refs may seem like a lot, it&#039;s definitely worth it because the integrity of the game is challenged each time these replacement officials step on the field. More money to the real officials is worth avoiding the unnecessary risk that is involved with the replacements. 

Is it going to take someone having their season ended on a cheap hit because these refs can&#039;t control a game?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sounds like you&#039;re a player&#039;s guy. &quot;The players take all the risk?&quot;
 I guess you&#039;ve never owned a business, because if you did you would know the majority of the risks are shared by the owners. 

Since you seem to think it&#039;s all about the money. &quot;The money to pay officials comes from a pot of $18 million funded by the league. The NFL wants an increase in the average salary for officials, who are part-time employees, from $149,000 to $189,000 by 2018. Referees (the head officials) and officials who qualify for postseason games would make more, the league said. The raises each year would fall between 5% and 11%, the league said. The officials have asked for more, but have not publicly disclosed how much.&quot; 
How many people do you know that are getting between 5 &#038; 11% raises? $149k to work 30 hours a week in season. That&#039;s almost $6k a WEEK! $191 per hour part time! It&#039;s not just about the money, there are other sticking points like retirement and reserve crews and hiring full time refs. At least that&#039;s my understanding. Maybe somebody better informed than me can shed more light on the situation.]]></description>
