		<description><![CDATA[Funny that UMass travels 60 miles for 12,000 fans and then travels 1000 miles to play in fromt of 110,000+ fans. Although they got the tar beat out of them. Nice check for the trip I am sure. 

What are the NHL players and owners thinking? 

Stanford has USC&#039;s number. And how bad will Arkansas&#039;s season be? The schedule just gets tougher and tougher in the SEC. 

Louisiana-Monroe almost did it again! Would have been nice to see them ranked.

REPLY - MPC - Louisiana could be a real special sports story if they were bold and went for 2 / I&#039;m a Stanford fan so I loved that game / NHL might as well jump off Golden Gate Bridge]]></description>
