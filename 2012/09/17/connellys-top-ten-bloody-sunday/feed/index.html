		<description><![CDATA[The 2001 lineup is pretty bad, but at least it has a Hall of Famer. Bobby V took a lot of heat for the comment, but he is right - the current lineup is horrible.  When you lead off with Pedro Ciriaco - .299 lifetime OBP in more than 3000 minor league AB - you are just not planning on scoring a lot of runs.

REPLY - MPC - No doubt that&#039;s a tough lineup but its passing the buck - he doesn&#039;t need to insult his players - everyone sees the lineup]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[nice point on that &#039;01 lineup.  that team was despicable, BUT they did have Pedro and Manny.  lot of bad dudes there, though - including Manny.

spending yesterday at the Pats game was a great time, but the heartbreaking manner in which they lost, coupled with a bizarre 2 and a half hour drive home to the north shore (we even waited a good 90 minutes after game in parking lot to get in our cars) made me surly today.

REPLY - MPC - It would be better to rent a helicopter and land it on the 50]]></description>
