		<description><![CDATA[I agree that the BC hockey team is very underrated.  Unfortunately, not only does that apply to the local media, but I think it applies to BC&#039;s own students, too.  I’m not a BC alumnus, but I’m a fan of their hockey team &#038; have gone to several games in each of the past few seasons.  I’m always amazed at how many empty seats there are in the student sections.  Besides that, the BC students that do show up are far from rabid.  They’re very quiet and appear disinterested most of the time.  

Typically, the loudest cheers during a BC game (when they are not playing BU), is when the other Hockey East scores are shown, and if BU is losing.  Multiple times this season, there were exciting &#038; tight games, not against BU, but while the game was going on, the students would shout “BU sucks!”.   I get it.  You hate BU.   But why don’t you try encouraging your excellent team, rather than mock a team that is not even in the building?  It reminds me of Red Sox fans yelling “Yankees Suck!” when they’re not even playing the Yankees.

REPLY - MPC - I agree its amazing - there might not be a better take in town than college hockey and to see seats empty over Conte is absurd. Ever since BC went National / global they have lost their roots]]></description>
