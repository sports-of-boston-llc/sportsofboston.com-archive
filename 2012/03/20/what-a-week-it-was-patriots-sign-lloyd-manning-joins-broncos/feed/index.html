		<description><![CDATA[Check that roll over cap space from the first year after the uncapped year.  But since there was no cap in 2010 some teams spent way under what the floor would have been.  When the new rule calls for 95% of the cap, teams way under had to spend and other teams pushed their cap space from 2011 to 2012.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What does this even mean?

&quot;A lot of bad teams last year had extra cap space from the lockout and “uncapped year.”&quot;

What did the 2010 season have to do with 2012 cap space?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First, the relevant financial comparison is between WEEI and the Sports Hub.  Each station is operated to make a profit on its own.  CBS doesn&#039;t want to subsidize 98.5 over the long run.  
Second, if it made financial sense to get another team&#039;s rights, I think WEEI could do it. 
Finally, WHY does WEEI need rights to turn things around?  You never give a reason and you never explain how that would work. WEEI cannot get the Bruins and it already has Pats Monday and Friday.  What does it gain from  broadcast rights when it is getting crushed during the weekdays?]]></description>
