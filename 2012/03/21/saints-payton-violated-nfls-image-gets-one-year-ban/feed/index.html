		<description><![CDATA[A harsh, but deserved suspension. Gregg Williams should never coach again. I find his statement today rather naive and comical. He says, &quot;I apologize to the players of the NFL for my involvement as it is not a true reflection of my values as a father or coach, nor is it reflective of the great respect I have for this game and its core principle of sportsmanship.&quot;

Uh, Gregg, yes it IS a true reflection of your values as a coach. It&#039;s not like this was one mistake he made on a bad day. This was a systematic multi-year flagrant disregard for the rules. Guys like this, who believe the public is stupid and will forgive, have no place in sports. Good riddance Gregg. And we&#039;ll see you in a year Sean.]]></description>
