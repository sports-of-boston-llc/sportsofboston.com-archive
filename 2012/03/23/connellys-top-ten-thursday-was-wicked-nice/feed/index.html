		<description><![CDATA[You forgot the Three Tainted super Bowls won by the *Patriots and Coach BeliCHEAT

REPLY - MPC - Every team in baseball, football and basketball scout plays and signals so the fact that the camera was on them from the sideline instead of the press box or the stands provides limited value to the Patriots which is proven by their winning % since the Jets game 2007. And don&#039;t tell me that they can&#039;t win the Super Bowl now - I think AFC championship games are pretty big - do you agree?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; Miami Dolphins...are going to give St. Louis two #1′s and a #2 for Robert Griffin III (they have no choice)

AFAIK, the Rams already agreed to trade the second overall pick in the draft to the R******s, and the R******s are planning to use that pick for RGIII.  So Miami doesn&#039;t have that choice either.


REPLY - MPC - Good help - Miami in trouble]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is shaping up to be possibly the most ethically challenged set of Final Four coaches in history. Boeheim, Calipari and Little Ricky. And Bill Raftery talks about Boeheim like he&#039;s a martyr--&quot;with all the distractions around him, all this man did was what he does best--coach kids.&quot; The Fab Melo thing boggles the mind. Unless he got caught cheating at some point in Feb, there is no way he could be academically ineligible for a couple weeks in early january, become eligible for the next 5 weeks and then become ineligible again. How does Syracuse get away with not forfeiting all those games or at least ask the question.

REPLY - MPC - Great comments - the world of NCAA - who is worse the inmates or the NCAA watching the inmates]]></description>
