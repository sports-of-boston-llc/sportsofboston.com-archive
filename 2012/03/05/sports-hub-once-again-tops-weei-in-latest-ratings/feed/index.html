Attacking Thomas because his politics are not the same as Felger&#039;s says more about what an a-hole Felger really is. I stopped listening and won&#039;t be back.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another reason WEEI is dropping off is the lack of coverage for the Bruins until it was too late to ignore them. Its hard to pretend they were on board when they ignored the team for years .. and even worse for WEEI, canned Dale Arnold right around the time The B&#039;s were getting hot.

Now, WEEI has huge broadcast contracts with two teams that are on a downward slope (Red Sox came in 3rd in the AL East 2 years in a row) and the Celtics looking like its going to possibly take years to be relevant again.

I believe they can get rid of one of the huge contracts this year with D&#038;C 5 year deal coming to an end. They&#039;ve already gotten rid of some of the crap that lead them to sink (&#039;Headlines&#039; for instance .. thank goodness they stopped John Dennis&#039; delusions that he COULD HAVE been a serious news anchor if only someone would have given him a chance!) Maybe they&#039;ll give Meterparel a chance to succeed without D&#038;C chopping his legs out from underneath him even 3 minutes.

You may ask WHY I still listen to WEEI? I cannot STAND Felger, who crossed the line into self-parody about 18 months ago, and they could probably run a &quot;soundboard&quot; of Mazz reaction quotes and you wouldn&#039;t even notice Tony wasn&#039;t there.

Also, you get Brady, Boomer Esiason, and Chuckles Belichick on Mondays during football season, and Brickley and Jack on the Big Show.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[FIne, CBS is bigger than Entercom.  Is WEEI bigger than the Sports Hub?  That is the question when you are talking about what the stations can afford.

Further, answer the underlying question.  Why does WEEI need more broadcast rights when it has the Red Sox, Celtics, and Patriots Monday and Friday?

The refusal of the author of this post to answer this question leads me to the conclusion that he is talking out of his ass.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Where do you get the info that Entercom lost $500 million last year?  None of the reports I just looked up show that.  It&#039;s net income per share was $1.81 and EBITDA was $100 million on revenues of $300 million.  And over the last 3 or so years the stock has hit $7.00 when it was almost delisted.  

Regardless, Entercom is different from WEEI. If it made financial sense for WEEI, they would have to be very cash strapped not to be able to pay for rights.  But why do they need another team&#039;s broadcast rights to make a turn around?  They already have Patriots Monday and Friday.  It doesn&#039;t seem that getting to cover them on Sunday wouldn&#039;t change much.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How do you know that Entercom doesn&#039;t have the money to get broadcast rights?  Or why do they even need to get broadcast rights?  They already pay for the Sox and Celtics and the station is making money even with the big salaries it is carrying.  WEEI doesn&#039;t need the resources of Entercom to compete.  It can do it on its own.]]></description>
