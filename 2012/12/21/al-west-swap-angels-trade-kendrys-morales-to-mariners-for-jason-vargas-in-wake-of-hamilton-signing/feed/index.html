		<description><![CDATA[D Mac As a Toronto fan, we are happy that your braintrust fired Epstien and Francona. They now waste money creating a .500 team and hoping Ferell can create miracles. While he was in Toronto, he created no pitching miracles. All miracles came from Jose Batista. A ball phenoms do not allways enter Hall of Fame. Today you are trading for a closer, who had a great era but is showing signs of fatigue and aging. With your first base position in question, realistically only your second bsseman and centre fielder could make the Jays. The next few seasons will be long.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The question isnt would you prefer Vargas and Morales over Dempster and Napoli, its Vargas and Morales over Dempster, Napoli, Ellsbury and Doubront.  Even assuming the former are slightly better than the latter, you&#039;re opening two holes to fill two holes.  Im all for trading Ells and Doubront in the right deals, but if you can fill holes by only spending money rather than personnel assets than thats the way to go.  You only trade in the offseason for assets that arent on the open market such as young talent or superstar.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You did a good job of looking into the two players you favored, and they would have been solid fits, but your defense of them (in comparison to the other two players mentioned) is very colored.

With Napoli, you cut out his best season (a season in which he was viewed to have a breakout...he&#039;s supposed to be more the player of the last two seasons than that of previous ones), and ignore that he will offer that bat at catcher on a number of days. You also overlook that Morales is still a major health question mark.

As for Vargas/Dempster, if you want to delve even deeper you can see that Dempster comes out looking just fine here. His bad 2011 is now almost certainly a product of bad luck with the batted ball, and he has otherwise been a very steady performer. He also has spent years at Wrigley, which offers many of the same issues to a pitcher than Fenway does, so he shouldn&#039;t see a major hit there (the switch to the AL may be another story). Vargas meanwhile has played in a major pitcher&#039;s park, and has often had the benefit of a strong defense behind him. That doesn&#039;t mean that he couldn&#039;t succeed for Boston, but he would have been a HUGE question mark. I think Dempster is more reliable, and given the form of investment (short term money) was the much safer option.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason Vargas because he would be awful at Fenway. Take a look at his homerun splits. The Red Sox do not have a low paid power hitting firstbaseman to give the Mariners.

Reply - DMac - Mariners needed help all over the field. I&#039;m not sure Ellsbury would have absolutely done it, but my point is, why isn&#039;t the front office at least kicking the tires on guys who aren&#039;t on their last legs and getting paid $13 million]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So you&#039;re gonna compare Morales to Napoli yet leave out Napoli&#039;s Career year in 2011. How does that make any sense? 

And...

Why in the world would the Angels a GFIN team want a project like Doubront over a proven vet like Vargas?

Reply - DMac - I left out the career year for the sole purpose of not giving away the Player A/B answer. I understand that Napoli had a career year in 2011, but it was so drastically different than his performances over the other three seasons that it could be considered the anomaly of the group. Ellsbury has had one monster season in his career, but people really only judge him for the two years he spent on the shelf, otherwise the Sox would be fielding a lot more calls for his services. If Napoli could be projected to match his career year numbers for another team, he could have easily gotten 4+ years out of a team that needed him, but he can&#039;t be truly trusted to post those numbers. Even with the career year, his career average line is .259/.356/.507/.863 versus Morales&#039; .281/.331/.491/.823. Those are pretty equivalent numbers. Granted, the power numbers haven&#039;t been there Morales&#039; whole career, but their 162 game averages have Morales posting only 5 HR less than Napoli and 8 more RBI. 

In regards to the Angels, I understand your gripe. My point was that the number of years under their control is higher, and he has had a year&#039;s worth of professional service time under his belt. It would have been a sell job, but another project player could have gotten the job done.

		<description><![CDATA[Doubront for Morales would be an awful move. Trust me, be glad it didn&#039;t happen. I&#039;d be open to trading for Morales but not for Doubront.

Reply - DMac - who would you suggest on their team that would fit with what the angels would have wanted to acquire Morales?]]></description>
