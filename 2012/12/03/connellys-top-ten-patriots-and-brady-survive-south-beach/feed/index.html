		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The pizza at the old Garden was great&quot;  Really?  Are you sure it wasn&#039;t the beer? ;-)

I don&#039;t think Danny should panic until Avery Bradley gets back.  The defense really came together last year when he got into the lineup.  Also deadline deals are not Ainge&#039;s forte.

REPLY - MPC - They need a presence in the paint that can rebound and block shots. Right now its like lay up line (I agree Bradley will change some of that - best on ball defender which isn&#039;t saying much). Pizza yum]]></description>
