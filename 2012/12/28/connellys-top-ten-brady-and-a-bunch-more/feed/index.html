		<description><![CDATA[&#062; Isn’t Nomar the poster person for the negative impact of steroids?

No. First, he had a successful career. Second, there&#039;s no admission or definitive proof that he juiced, only speculation. That&#039;s a long way from being a poster person.

REPLY - MPC - Take a look at Nomar&#039;s stats before and after he posed with no shirt on SI. He was a shoo in for the Hall of Fame and now is lucky to be a top 25 short stop of all time. Successful is relative - if you don&#039;t reach potential what does that mean (if you believe he put on that muscle mass naturally - I guessing you&#039;re not a doctor)]]></description>
