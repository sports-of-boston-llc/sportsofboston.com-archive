		<description><![CDATA[Extra point may be the biggest waste of time in sports.  Thanks for mentioning the Steve Young prediction because if the Texans won, he certainly would have received some attention for being insightful as opposed to being wrong by over 4 touchdowns.  Great Top 10 as usual.

REPLY - MPC - yes on extra point forgot - no kickoff and extra point would take away commercial opportunities probably - TD and place ball on 25]]></description>
