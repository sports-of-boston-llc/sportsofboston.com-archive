		<description><![CDATA[If I was Boston I would not trade for Dickey the prospects you mentioned because the Team will not be a contender with or without him. Congratulations on signing another left handed DH to platoon in Steven Drew. (Yes he is a butcher at Shortstop).

Your lifetime statstics mean little as he has been under 3 runs per game for the past 600 innings since developing the same pitch that permitted Wakefield to pitch late in his 40s.

Toronto should not have given up Syndraguard, save which year do they want to go for it.

Boston would be a much better team with Epstien GM and Francona manager. Your problem are owners who interfere too much.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,
  Stand in the position of what the Mets WANTED for R.A Dickey. Even though the Jays obtained Dickey, the Mets wanted our future SS Xander Bogaerts and our future OF Jackie Bradley Jr JUST for Dickey. Do you realize how substantial Bogaerts and Bradley mean to this team in the future?Thats the reason why I wanted to stay away. Plus, Dickey is 38 years old wanting a lot of money. His lowest ERA in the AL in a full season is 4.62. Sure he had a few good stints against Yankees and Rays but just because he had 2 good outings, does not mean that he will fully dominate in the AL. It happens all the time with players. For example, Edgar Renteria. In the NL, he was dominate with the Cards/Braves/Giants. With the Tigers/Sox, he was dreadful. Some are even arguing that the Sox signing of Dempster was bad because he pitched bad in the AL. But, he only had 13 full starts in the AL. The big picture though is the Mets asking price for Dickey was way too much in which the Sox could not hand 2 of their best prospects for a 38 year old pitcher.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your logic on American League and National League is totally offbase in this circumstance.  He started throwing the knuckleball at Texas and only mastered it in New York. His prior lifetime stats are based on traditional pitching, which was slowing down prior to learning the knuckle ball.  That being said, and it appears you do not confuse yourself with facts, he has signed or will sign with Toronto. I doubt the Red Sox with him, were good enough to beat Toronto without him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The reason why R.A. Dickey number was bad vs the AL is because that was before he rediscovered himself as a pitcher. He play for the mets so you can easily look at his inter league stats such as the subway series when he shut out yanks twice, 2 hit the rays etc he basically destroyed the AL since becoming a Met. He just developed his knuckle ball he&#039;s basically a new pitcher and a dominate one look at his last three years?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Martin,
 Thank you for commenting.
  It is unfair to say Dempster is bad in the AL. He has only pitched 1/2 a season in the American League. Dickey has pitched a full 8 seasons in the AL.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[True story but the same goes for Ryan Dempster. He will struggle back in the AL.

How come the GM&#039;s don&#039;t seem to see this? We don&#039;t need more Brad Penny type of deals.]]></description>
