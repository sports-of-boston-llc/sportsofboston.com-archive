		<description><![CDATA[Troy Brown #78 all time in receptions; not in the top 250 in Receiving TDs or Rec. YPG.  Patriots Hall of Fame for sure, but not Canton.

REPLY - MPC - Special teams, defense, the substance of his contributions his intangibles in three super bowls - like a Phil Rizzuto part of a dynasty]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Brady and Pierce get their numbers retired, up the air on Chara.  He certainly could depending on where his time with the Bruins goes, but right now I&#039;d say no. Ortiz for the Red Sox should be in that debate as well, I&#039;d say yes for him as well.

REPLY - MPC - Fair points - Ortiz won&#039;t make Hall of Fame though and that is part of criterion]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good observation about Brady struggling when he held the ball. On plays where he held it for 2.5 seconds or longer he had a completion percentage of 32.8% and a QB rating of 26.2.

MPC - REPLY - Thats not very good - might speak to two things - his receivers don&#039;t get great separation and he doesn&#039;t throw the deep ball well which is where receiverd are breaking off routes to]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[excellent writing today.

surprised to see you still feel the pats can make a superbowl!  don&#039;t love them on road for 2 straight weeks going into DEN and then HOU... AND, they may have to contend with Bengals or Jets in 1st round... tough road.

Key is to keep Brady upright for next 2 weeks... didn&#039;t get whacked around too too bad last night (only 1 bone cruncher that i saw).

REPLY - MPC - Brady gives you a chance every game -sad thing is Manning might have won MVP yesterday]]></description>
