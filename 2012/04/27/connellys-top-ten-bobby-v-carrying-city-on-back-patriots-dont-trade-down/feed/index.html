		<description><![CDATA[Re: College football playoffs. Eight teams = seven games, four quarters, two semis, one final. 
First six = Rose, Cotton, Sugar, Fiesta, Orange, and pick one more for first six. Rotate the quarters and semis so everyone gets a piece of the action. 
Create one more bowl for the final, create huge bidding war. Or rotate the existing big five and let the them each have a turn hosting the final, maybe even better. 
Everyone wins. More money than everyone has ever made. Existing major bowls included. Real champion crowned. Who cares if No. 9 excluded, sorry.
The fact that this has not happened yet is a testimony to the wrong palms being greased.
By the way, I thought this solution up about five years ago in five minutes. And every other college football level has larger football playoffs that conclude in December. This is ridiculous.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[*He was great in 2010-11 but now is the time to trade Tim Thomas. He was outplayed by Brandon Holby.  Thomas has 1-year left on his contract, but Rask is now a restricted free agent &#038; is due for a bump.  Thomas  may not bring back as much as people think, but his departure would bring $5M in cap space.  Call Chicago.  They&#039;re built to win now, but Crawford was a disaster in the playoffs. San Jose might be another potential landing spot.

* I agree that Krejci was bad, but he was bad in the 1st round last year &#038; ended up being the leading playoff scorer. Obviously, it cost them this year, but I wouldn&#039;t trade him yet.

* They survived it last year, but the lack of the powerplay was fatal this year.  It probably had something to do with the faceoff, but late in the 1st period, Julien&#039;s opening line for a PP was Pouliot-Rolston-Seguin.  Having said that, the PP in the final 2-minutes of the 3rd period was beyond pathetic.
* It will be interesting to see how they handle Dougie Hamilton.  Potentially, he is exactly what they have been missing.  He&#039;s a fast skating, puck moving defenseman.  He&#039;s big, too - 6&#039;-4&quot;.  However, he still doesn&#039;t turn 19 until this June &#038; tall defensemen usually take longer to develop.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Beautiful - including Kid n&#039; Play in the Top Ten is genius.

I am so bummed the Bruins lost, but I would rather them allow the play to end the game the other night then dissallow a goal because of an inconsequential toe in the crease.

Got a call from a guy from Charlotte this morning asking me about Keuchly - said he never heard of him.  Such a shame - I filled him in.  Now he&#039;s psyched.  Huge loss for BC.

The interception by Keuchly against Miami is all they need to know about his will. I agree no call was the right call on Goalie interference]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Any truth to the rumor that &quot;Coach&quot; Gene D heard there was a camera crew at the Kuchely house and dispatched a jet to attempt to get there in time to get on camera? The guy is a disingenuous self promoter and doesn&#039;t have a sincere bone in his body.

REPLY - MPC - Someone would have to point out who Kuchely is to the &quot;coach&quot; who never coached]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Coach&quot; Gene D should be ashamed. For all the whining and moaning they do about no love at BC, they had the BEST LB in the nation for 3 years and did nothing to promote him. 

Herzlich is and was a wnoderful story, but this kid has been nothing short of amazing since the day he showed up and they never once tried to hype him.

REPLY - MPC - &quot;Coach&quot; D saw value in Herzlich in a marketing way - the other guy was just a great football player]]></description>
