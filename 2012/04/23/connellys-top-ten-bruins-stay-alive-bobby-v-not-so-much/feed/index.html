		<description><![CDATA[Right on with Lucic! He plays more like a Sedin sister then a Big Bad Bruin. NOBODY glides more than Lucic. 
Again right on with NESN and the 100th anniversary. They could&#039;ve thrown a Red Sox uniform on any homeless person and paraded him out there. Nobody would&#039;ve known the difference. 
As for the Red Sox this is what $170M dollar bridge year looks like. A bridge to nowhere. Henry &#038; Luchinno ARE the problem. Bobby V shouldn&#039;t have been hired in the first place. Demarlo Hale should be the manager.

REPLY - MPC - I wonder if the Sox did put a uniform on Kramer as he was a sit filler at the Tony&#039;s one year on Seinfeld / The Bruins should send him video and try to calculate a stat for ice covered without arms and legs pumping]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[* I agree with tronburger.  I love Thornton, too, but there is is no way that Lucic should sit before Thornton.

* Marchand&#039;s constant flopping in the series caused the non-call when he was elbowed in the face at the end of the 2nd period.  Even on that play, he embellished it.  I&#039;m shocked that he&#039;s still pulling that crap. 

*B&#039;s miss Adam McQaid.  You notice more traffic in front of Thomas without McQaid being on the ice (as opposed to Zannon, Mottau, or Corvo).

* Holtby has trouble with the glove on some shockingly easy shots.  A Bruin lobbed one in on Saturday from just past the red line, &#038; it went right through Holtby&#039;s glove but wide.  Boychuk&#039;s goal from the blue line had no screen.  Other than the glove issue, he&#039;s been great.

* I would add &quot;puck moving defenseman&quot; for &quot;Tough To Fill&quot; for the Bruins.  Since the trade of Ray Bourque, the B&#039;s have unsuccessfully tried to fill the role with many, including: Jonathan Girard, Sergei Gonchar (he flopped in his 1-playoff series here), Dennis Wideman, Tomas Kaberle, &#038; Joe Corvo.  Shawn Thornton pointed out last week that that the B&#039;s &quot;puck moving defenseman&quot; always ends up being the whipping boy here, but I think the unhappiness has been justified.

REPLY - MPC - I agree McQuaid not being there hurt / Good point on puck moving defensemen / my point on Thornton was exaggerated for a point but in retrospect maybe not far fetched from what we got in production]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Basketball Power forward (Just McHale, Silas, Heinsohn&quot;??!~!

Excuse me? What about KG? He is a better player than any of those three, good though they were.

REPLY - MPC - I agree he should be on that list but you are wrong about him being better than Heinsohn and McHale]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[lucic can be irritating, but he gives you more than shawn thornton any day.  sorry, that&#039;s just crazy talk!

bobby v had no clue what he was getting into, coming back to baseball in boston of all places.  it&#039;s going to be great when he really loses it this month...

REPLY - MPC - Shawn Thornton has better hands than Lucic and less turnovers - Lucic is a 23 goal scorer (5 empty netters) - Lucic better yes but not by salary differential]]></description>
