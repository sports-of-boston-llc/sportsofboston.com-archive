		<description><![CDATA[BC Hockey accomplishments are indeed impressive.  But hockey is a niche not a mainstream sport, Boston is not a college sports town, and BC is a private school, not a big public institution.  I&#039;m not sure I am surprised at the level of attention it has gotten.

REPLY - MPC - not even big on their campus]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was really hoping for Ottawa to play the B&#039;s.  I think the B&#039;s would have keyed on Karlson &#038; shut them down.  Capitals have a lot of offensive talent that missed a lot of regular season games that is now back - specifically, Nicklas Backstrom &#038; Mike Green.  

A rookie goalie, Braden Holtby, is expected to start game-1 for Washington.  Sometimes a rookie goalie can surprise in the playoffs &#038; become a great goalie (Ken Dryden).  In their history, the B&#039;s have also lost to rookie goalies, who ended up being mediocre goalies (Steve Penney). The B&#039;s had their own rookie goalie who won a playoff series but turned out to be a &quot;1-hit wonder&quot;(Mike Moffat).  Rookie goalies are wild cards.  

B&#039;s should still win, but I think Caps have a lot more ammunition at this point than Ottawa would to potentially pull an upset.

REPLY - MPC - Good call in retrospect]]></description>
