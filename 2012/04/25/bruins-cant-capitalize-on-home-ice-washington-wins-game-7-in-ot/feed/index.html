		<description><![CDATA[The third line and third defensive pairing were on the ice for the game winner. Julien deserves a lot of the blame for the lackluster power play but its also on the players. Seguin had a huge give away on the power play at the end of the third period. Might be time to get an assistant head coach that is all about offense to help the power play units.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[IMO, bad coaching.  Julien left the top lines in too long, until their legs were cooked.  This was must evident in the second period and beginning of the third, when the Bruins were tired, slow and sloppy. But in overtime, it cost the Bruins the game, when the Capitals made a complete line change after 2 minutes of play, Julien left the tired Boston first line in, and then the Caps skated right past the Bruins to put in the winning goal.  Of course, the Bruins could have avoided overtime completely if they had scored on one of their power plays in regulation.  But just like last year, the Boston power play was lackluster, wasting a lot of time slowly passing the puck around the perimeter and making very few shots.  The Bruins power play was not very good last year, and Julien should have had that figured out already.  So IMO, this season all came down to one thing: coaching.]]></description>
