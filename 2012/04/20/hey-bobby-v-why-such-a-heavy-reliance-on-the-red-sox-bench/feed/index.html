		<description><![CDATA[Great article.  I believe that all teams face the same struggles to balance starters, first line bench, scrub fillers and injuries.  Given the BoSox payroll, though, I was hoping that we&#039;d have the means to weather these storms a bit better and not be the door mat of the AL East.  I agree that we can&#039;t blame just the manager or management but, as they say, a fish starts to rot from the head.  Once the sellout streak ends and people stop buying bricks (and pink hats), management will realize that they have to give us a compelling product for our entertainment dollars.   Maybe my new phrase should be that I hope to live to see the Sox win the World Series again in my lifetime.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Baseball is a team sport.  As everyone knows, in  pro ball team rosters are set at 25 active players. In the AL this includes a DL who bats for the pitcher.  With half of the roster reserved for pitchers, and 9 positions set aside for defensive position on the field, team benches usually consist of 3, sometimes 4 players, that usually include a backup catcher, an infielder, an outfielder, and the DH.  The most useful utility infielder is one capable of playing at least 3 positions.  The 4th outfielder that can play both corner fields and center field is ideal.  This maximizes team flexibility in the event of injury, illness or early departure from an on-going game.  

Over the span of a 162 game season, bench players may be called on to play as often as 75% of games played.  This is especially true with teams that have aging veterans playing regularly. It behooves the smart manager to select the most talented individual available for these back up positions and to play them often, early, to learn their strengths and weaknesses, especially if they are new to the team.  The Red Sox seem to be doing exactly that with backup catcher, Shoppach, and utility fielder Punto.  

As for backup outfielder MacDonald, he is, quite likely, the 25th man on the roster.  Thus, when Carl Crawford and Jacoby Ellsbury return from the DL  and begin playing regularly, he will probably be sent to Pawtucket, along with recent call up, Spears.

As for Bard, he has probably requested that he be allowed to pitch out of jams he creates for himself, and to pitch as long as he possibly can, to strengthen his arm.  Except for his wildness of a few nights ago, he has pitch well, not great, but well.  If Dice-K returns and pitches as he did early in his career, Bard may indeed end up the closer again, assuming no other injuries to starters. Presumably, Thomas will be long gone by then.

BTW, IMHO, I support the idea of expanding the roster to 27 positions to accommodate the DH and to allow teams to carry an additional pitcher.  The NL&#039;s pinch hitter is almost nonexistent in the AL....and what better way to add drama and excitement to  game than to have an aged slugger, rather than the utility infielder or backup catcher, come to bat, once, in  critical late inning situation.]]></description>
