		<description><![CDATA[#1
Bergeron best two-way Bruins player since Adam Oates.. Oates was always under estimated but in addition to putting up 100+ points a season he was superb at faceoffs and penalty killing

REPLY - MPC - I agree with your points but was he that good deep in his own zone -don&#039;t remember]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Iglesias is still young enough to improve, but he has a long way to go.  His career minor league OPS is .615! Ouch.  Hanley Ramirez at the same age had a career minor league OPS of .785, and he was starting in the majors.  I don&#039;t think Iglesias will ever hit enough to hold down a big league job.


REPLY - MPC - If you&#039;re right thats not good they have a lot riding on this kid]]></description>
