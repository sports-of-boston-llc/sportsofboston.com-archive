		<description><![CDATA[Your expectations for a 19 year old player are extraordinary.  It seems that you are using Stamkos as a measuring stick for Seguin and no one else, which is unfair.  Also, I believe trading Krejci and Lucic is a shortsighted view considering the impact they had in last years playoffs.  Krejci did not play up to par this series, but was a point a game player last year in the playoffs.  Even though Lucic was terrible last night, he still is a 25-30 goal scorer and an impactful player.  Why &quot;shake up&quot; a team that is 1 year removed from a cup, especially considering the cap friendly deals of both Krejci and Lucic?  Additionaly, you mentioned several top 10&#039;s ago that you heard Seguin is known for having a bad attitude around the Garden and I think that is clouding your judgment of him.  Perhaps in the next top 10 you could compare his production to other high draft picks at the same age?

MPC - Appreciate your opinon - Seguin is 20 and Stamkos is 22 (close?) so lets go to Stamkos season when he was 20 - he scored 50 goals / Lucic was not good last year in the playoffs either. I will grant you that Krejci was good last years playoffs but underachieved this regular season also.]]></description>
