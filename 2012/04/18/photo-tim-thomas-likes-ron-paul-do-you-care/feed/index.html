But yes, I happen to be interested in politics AND love sports (but clearly separate as you can see I run a SPORTS blog haha)...and I don&#039;t think they need to be intertwined...ever. No thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know KC, totally.  Who cares?

If there is one thing sacred in this country, its sports.  Hockey specifically.  For me, it lets me numb out the more complicated things in life like politics and war.  It allows me to turn a blind eye on injustice and corruption.  It gives me an in-group to rally around and a clearly defined enemy to project my anger upon.  

Politics?  No thanks.  That stuffs for nerds.  I&#039;ll hang a flag above my door, but educate myself as to the virtues of that symbol?  Nah bro.  Caring is for losers and nerds.  I&#039;m with you...who cares?]]></description>
