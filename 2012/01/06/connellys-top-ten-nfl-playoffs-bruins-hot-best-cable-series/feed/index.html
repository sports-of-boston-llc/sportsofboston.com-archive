		<description><![CDATA[patriots only the 9th team in modern NFL history to make the playoffs without beating a team with a winning record (denver and SD finish 8-8).

not that I think it matters... count me on the zolak bandwagon about patriots defense being very average, but also extremely coachable.  hard workers out there, this year... at least.

only heading into their 4th and 5th seasons respectively, but Justified and Sons of Anarchy are some of the top cable programs out there.  Sons may suffer from its frustrating and ridiculous season 4 finale.

for most younger people (myself included), namath will be remembered as the guy that hit on suzy kolber (!?!), nothing more, nothing less.  top 3 funniest live moments of TV in my life.

REPLY - MPC - Good generational not on Namath / Pats defense is embarrassing / worst secondary and linebacking core in the entire league]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Only home team I like in the NFL playoffs this weekend is the Saints. Lions will hang around but too much Drew Brees. 

Matt Ryan no wins in the playoffs. 

Orange Bowl, lowest tv ratings ever for a BCS Bowl. 

Great early match-up in college football in 2012--West Va. at FSU. 

Ball or Barkley for Heisman. 

Celtics are the third best team in the East, but are closer to the Knicks than the Heat. 

Van Gundy is unhappy with Baby Davis--too many shots. Shocking, not! Steal trade by Danny A.--Bass for Davis. 

Ridley brings a physical presence to the running game. Of course, he&#039;s a rookie and that concerns me with him running and the Pats have a lead in the 4th. 

Just wondering, who wins more games next year? Weis and the Jayhawks or O&#039;Brien and Penn State?

REPLY - MPC - Penn State wins 6 which is more / Fat cat bowl directors better be careful they don&#039;t lose the whole thing - they should merge with playoffs / Always been a Bass fan yes great trade on a guy they might have dumped]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good analogy on the &#039;77 Sox.  Too bad Zimmer ruined Bill Campbell&#039;s promising career that season.

Earl Monroe was so spectacular a player he was known as the Black Jesus on the venerable Philly playground circuit.  In his senior year at Div. II Winston Salem State he averaged 41.6 ppg and led his team to the national championship.  I&#039;d argue he introduced the spin move to the sport of basketball, and along with Pete Maravich, helped usher in the &quot;razzle dazzle&quot; style to the game.  He was also virtually unstoppable one- on- one as he brought the combination of shooting and dribbling to a new art form.  Couldn&#039;t disagree more on your overrated assessment. As for Namath, he led his overmatched team to winning pro football&#039;s most important game of the Super Bowl era while also being the face of an entire league.  Nuf said.

REPLY - MPC - I agree he was the original with the spin more and was great to watch - I have him on my all time top ten showmen of NBA but didn&#039;t dominate after the first couple of years - was a piece of the puzzle in NY - Namath was a all or nothing guy but wouldn&#039;t be considering a top 20 QB in NFL history]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your best cable series list is pretty good, but I guess you&#039;ve ever seen Breaking Bad or Deadwood either.

REPLY - MPC - Deadwood too raw and dark for me. I forgot Games of Thrones - have heard good things about Breaking Bad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree that Namath is overrated, but, to be fair, completion percentages, passer ratings, TD/INT ratios etc. were all much, much lower in the 60&#039;s AFL than they are today.  BTW have you ever noticed how thoroughly Lenny Dawson dominated the passing statistics of the AFL?

On Reggie I do not agree with you. He is a totally deserving Hall of Famer, one of the best OF of his era.  And again batting averages, HR totals etc. were far lower in the late 60&#039;s early 70&#039;s American league than they are today.

REPLY - MPC - You take away 10 postseason HR&#039;s and he&#039;s nothing but a self promoter / Dawson under the radar then - I liked him doing color]]></description>
