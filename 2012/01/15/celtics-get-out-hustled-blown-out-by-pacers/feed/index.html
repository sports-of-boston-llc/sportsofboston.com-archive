		<description><![CDATA[Boston is so S..L..O..W..  Every team they play is younger, quicker and more athletic.  Rivers is a great coach if you&#039;re a veteran, but I bet we&#039;ll never see a rookie of the year on his team.  Sparse minutes for Moore and Johnson when the team clearly needs a spark of youth and athleticism.  Why not give the kids a chance?  Couldn&#039;t be any worse, could it?

BTW, I thought I&#039;d never see a guard who shot jumpers poorer than Rondo, but we now have the almost unbelievably bad shooting of Avery Bradley to look at.  He has great defensive energy, but he&#039;s a second rate floor general and rarely finds the rim with his shot, let alone the net.  Let&#039;s give Moore a chance at that position.

This season is embarrassing.]]></description>
