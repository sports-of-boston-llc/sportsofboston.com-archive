		<description><![CDATA[Jfan - I agree that the Yankees back end is stronger but the Sox trio should belong in the conversation, just look at the inning and ERA of the six from 2011:

Andrew Bailey 41.2, 3.24
Daniel Bard 73.0, 3.33
Mark Melancon 74.1, 2.78

Mariano Rivera 61.1, 1.91
David Robertson 66.2, 1.08
Rafael Soriano 39.1, 4.12

I expect stronger years from Soriano and Bard (if he stays in the bullpen), and steps back from Rivera and Robertson, as well as Melancon in a new league, but overall they&#039;re certainly debatable for 2012 if healthy. The problem now is that the Yankees have sured up their rotation, making their entire staff deeper and stronger.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jim - I hear what you&#039;re saying but the Sox haven&#039;t shown the signs of spending money on pitchers like Oswalt, and they shouldn&#039;t because they do have depth in their pitching. The idea of assembling a mass of starters is similar to the way the Yankees rediscovered Bartolo Colon and Freddy Garcia last year. The Sox have enough offense to carry them into October, and if that trio at the top of the rotation stays healthy, they can win it all behind them. You don&#039;t need 4 or 5 aces when you have the best lineup in baseball and a potentially brilliant bullpen.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t agree.Starting pitching is &quot;iffy&quot;at best.Sox should grab Oswalt.Check the era&#039;s of Cook,Miller,and Silva.If you have to score more than five runs a game to win(all three have lousy lifetime eras)you are going to lose.Check Wakefields era down the stretch last year.For that matter check his era for any year.Ditto Silva and Cook.
