		<description><![CDATA[Gentlemen, the author is objectively highlighting some tangible examples of how the Sox are stacking up to the Yankees.  Comparing the messenger to body parts and other poorly-structured metaphors seems to be more of a sign of frustration that Red Sox nation is slipping down from its apex.  The extensive comments suggest that the talented author hit a nerve of truth.  As Reese Bobby said, &quot;If you ain&#039;t first, your&#039;e last&quot;.  I don&#039;t wanna be last!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You do understand that after receiving stem cell replacement surgery on his shoulder, Bartolo Colon was pitching in Puerto Rico last winter, and was hitting upwards of 96 on the gun. Tony Pena watched him pitch, and having been a former catcher, saw Colon&#039;s ability to make outs. Colon, in his prime, a power pitcher, had regained his ability to dial up his fastball. This, as anyone who knows a goddamn thing about baseball, gave him a shot to be effective again, if only in a relief role. Anything else beyond that was a bonus. And for the Yankees, it was, until July.

Freddy Garcia pitched 150+ innings in 2010 (more innings than he pitched last season, actually) and had a better shot of producing as a junkballer, whether it be for a full season or at least until the trade deadline. He too, went above and beyond. But again, he pitched in 2010 as a #5 for the White Sox, and that&#039;s all the Yankees were looking for out of him.

Webb was horrendous (and that&#039;s being kind) last season. He sported a 9.75 ERA in AA before being shutdown. He had no velocity on his sinker, his bread-and-butter, and therefore was ineffective against even minor league hitters.

Sheets has been on the shelf since 2010, and there is no word on whether or not he&#039;ll ever pitch again.

What in the fuck makes ANYONE think either of these two guys are a better risk than Silva and Padilla and Cook? It makes ZERO sense to think Webb or Sheets might help a team this season. 

By my logic, you&#039;re better off rolling the dice with players who are able to go to Spring Training and compete, not guys who are unable to pitch in any capacity because they are not signed and are drawing zero interest. As I said before, what is so hard to understand???

Bill Simmons is full of shit. He was a pioneer and an innovator, but he&#039;s been garbage since 2007. He should go drop some more karate kid references and write about how he&#039;s the best handicapper in all of sports even though his wife outdid him in betting lines. Twice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Okay, hotshot, let&#039;s break this down.

You seem to be making the assumption that a pitcher who hasn&#039;t played for 2 seasons is no longer a capable player.

Colon didn&#039;t pitch in 2010 and for all intensive purposes, didn&#039;t have a significant playing season since 2006.

So by your logic Colon is the only pitcher capable of rising from the dead.  It would be impossible for Sheets or Webb or Harden to do the same?  No, but it&#039;s highly unlikely.  Just like it was for Colon.  That&#039;s the point.

And for what it&#039;s worth, I think Bill Simmons is great.]]></description>

Yeah, I&#039;m sure a moron! 

&quot;If you are going to buy cheap, buy pitchers who can be good.&quot;

Great analysis, says no one in the history of the world. You are a fucking dummy. Buy pitchers who can be good. Great advice. You should work for NASA. The problem with the writers post is he suggest pitchers who suck. So why is that a good position? Identifying Boston&#039;s rotations issues is like pointing out the problems with healthcare in America. WOW, GREAT JOB, YOU JUST STATED THE MOST OBVIOUS THING EVER! GREAT POST!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cook and Silva have been consistently mediocre. They aren&#039;t so old that they are only living in the shadows. Aaron Cook has never been a strikeout pitcher which works to his advantage. Guys like him might not get drastically better but they stay about the same for a very long time because they know how to pitch a different type of game. Coming from Colorado his numbers have certainly been inflated, not that fenway isn&#039;t any less of a hitter&#039;s park, but if Cook can continue to be a guy who can pitch to a low 4. e.ra. that&#039;s a great back of the rotation guy.

The other thing that the writer is missing is that right now it appears that we are only looking for a guy to fill in the 5th spot. I personally believe Bard has all the stuff of becoming a solid starter, he&#039;s matured as a pitcher and to see him pitch to a mid-high 3 e.r.a. will be great. 

Boston isn&#039;t expecting Silva, Cook, and Padilla to come in as saviors they are coming in to eat up a couple innings and keep guys in the game. If you can believe that crawford, youkilis can bounce back and adrian can keep his power numbers up all year with a strong shoulder you&#039;re still looking at the deepest line-up in the a.l. Just because crawford had a bad year people expect the offense to be worse, but look at how boston&#039;s averages compared to the yankees last year. and then look at tampa bay lol. While they still have very formidable teams, the redsox are in a much better position than people are pitting them as. 

As a side note, I think Oswalt would come to boston and get injured in a less than a month, and who knows if kuroda will be able to pitch in the a.l. east.
Mind you, Pineda&#039;s e.r.a was over 5 after the half and he only recorded 1 win? His road e.r.a. was all horrible compared to a mid 2 e.r.a. in safeco.  did the yankees really do THAT great? time will tell]]></description>

&quot;Instead of Cook, Silva, and Padilla they should set their sight on Ben Sheets, Brandon Webb, and Rich Harden.&quot;

Why don&#039;t you critical think your way through this passage. It doesn&#039;t matter if he thinks they are the perfect solution or not, to even suggest two pitchers who haven&#039;t thrown a major league inning in almost 2 (in Webb&#039;s case, 2+) years is RETARDED. Padilla, Cook, and Silva are not good, but they are better than pitchers WHO HAVE HAD MAJOR SURGERIES AND ARE NOT PLANNING TO PLAY BASEBALL. 

What is so hard for you to understand??? To not know these pitchers are on the shelf is just a poor oversight, and for you to defend this shitty post doesn&#039;t make any sense. Continue to try and imply that I am unable to apply tenth grade English Lit &#038; Composition techniques to a crappy blog post, and I will continue to explain to you that the writer had no idea that these two fucking guys are not pitching any time soon, whether he meant them to be the definitive rotation answers, or not.

And to the writer, stop regurgitating Bill Simmons quips - he hasn&#039;t been a good/clever writer in at least half-a-decade.]]></description>

Are you at all literate?  

As pitchers reach the wrong side of 30, they are not going to perform any better than they previously have.  Therefore they have a certain maximum potential (a ceiling) they can reach.  I don&#039;t think the writer thinks Ben Sheets or Brandon Webb are the perfect solution, but that being said, a shadow of Webb or Sheets has significantly more potential than the shadow of Cook, Silva, or Padilla.

Learn critical thinking skills before you make a foolish ass of yourself.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Rod,

Actually, the writer&#039;s point was not that low cost pitching doesn&#039;t work. It was sort of the opposite. Reread the Yankees section if you&#039;re unclear as to what the writer was hinting at. 

And just to be clear, his (the writer&#039;s) logic is horrible. Sign pitchers that used to be really good because they have a better chance at being good again. Wait..what? That is a ridiculous approach. Rod, do you understand staffing and baseball? Because if you do, you would realize talking about signing Ben Sheets and Brandon Webb is one of the dumbest ideas in the history of blogging. 

I came here through MLBTR, thinking they would filter the content they link. Obviously, they don&#039;t, because this is some fucking garbage.]]></description>
