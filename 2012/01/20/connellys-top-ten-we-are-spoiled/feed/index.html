		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m going with the Niners on Sunday. SF 26 NYG 22

Chung with a big day! Anderson with a solid game, sacking Flacco twice and multiple pressures. 

Last AFC Championship game at home, Brady was awful. Maroney with a big day against the Chargers. 

Willie Clay with the big pick in the north end zone against the Jags. Parcells&#039; last home game as head coach of the Patriots. 

2004 AFC Title game in Pitts.---NE had a field day. Remember, the first AFC Title game with Brady/Belichick, Bledsoe finished the game. 

BC can&#039;t recruit because their facilities are weak. Alumni Stadium, some of these kids have played in high school games with more of an atmosphere. Not too mention Towel Boy as head coach. When will the Eagles get a real head coach? Its been a while.

REPLY - MPC - Boston College needs to turn to boosters to finance the program / now Brady had another bad AFC Title game]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[-Good point on Brady, win or lose he has given us a lot to be grateful for.
-I have been away from Boston for a long time, but does BC actually make them go to class and pass?
-Very interesting point on 85-86 Celtics.  I am not sure about where they rank, but agree on the point.
-Suggs &quot;my quarterback&quot; speech was right up there with Terrell Owens&#039;on Romo--cringe-worthy. stuff.  
-Any chance of snow on Sunday?  
-Charleston Chews, remember freezing them? Ah yes...

REPLY - MPC - Yes frozen Charleston Chews / Brady is special - top four in Boston history]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With a Pats victory, Brady can tie Joe Montana for the most postseason wins by a QB.

Forgive the nitpick, but the Big Three came aboard starting in the 1980-81 season.  Still, the team made the ECF seven of those eight seasons.

That 1963 Charger squad was so good, that head coach Sid Gilman swore his team could beat the NFL champion Chicago Bears.

REPLY - MPC- Interesting on Chargers - I did get loose with the first Big Three - with Bird obviously the anchor]]></description>
