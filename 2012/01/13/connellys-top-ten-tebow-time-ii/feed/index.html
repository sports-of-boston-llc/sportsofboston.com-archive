		<description><![CDATA[Footnote to the Pats in Denver back in 1988, it was also Tony Dorsett&#039;s last football game in the NFL. Just wanted to pass that information along.

		<description><![CDATA[Pats win by double digits. 

Contrasting styles tomorrow in San Francisco. Niners best &quot;D&quot; among the playoffs. 

Giants will hang around, running game is peaking at the right time. GB has too much on offense and the Packers &quot;D&quot; forces turnovers.

Elway&#039;s last game picked on Eugene Robinson (hanging out with those hookers in Miami) and he ate the Falcons alive. Elway won the MVP.

Rulon Jones with a safety on Eason in that playoff game.  I believe it was Pete Brock that whiffed on that block. Also, Fryar fielded a punt around the 10 yard line. 

Brady and Belichick first ever playoff loss in Denver against Plummer and the Broncos. 

Not only did Stanford beat USC in Los Angeles (triple OT game) the Trojans lost to Arizona State in Tempe. Bad loss for USC!

REPLY - MPC - Two things I remember about that Denver game was that Berry tried to run a roll out play that they had great success with Flutie but had Eason run it inside the five and it got stuffed / at the end of the game he brought Flutie in for a Hail Mary - after the game Flutie said something like - they told me my arm strength is why they didn&#039;t play me and then they bring me in because they said I had the strongest arm]]></description>

REPLY - MPC - Some of the crap he has accepted for scripts is a disgrace - I agree Face Off and Con Air were good enough for a Blockbuster vcr tape rental]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tony Eason also owns the ignominous distinction of taking the worst sack in Pats history.  Trailing the Broncos 20-17 in the 1987 playoffs at Denver, Eason was sacked in the end zone with just a minute and half left in regulation.

In one of those dramatic seventh games against the Celtics in the playoffs, Wilt once refused to take a shot in the final quarter just to prove he could pass.

When Isiah Thomas made that ill advised comment about Larry after the during the 1987 playoffs, Johhny Most nicknamed him &quot;The snake that smiles.&quot;

REPLY - MPC - &quot;They tell me not to say bad things about Isiah and I say why not!&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I might catch hell for saying this out loud, but I liked the movie &quot;Family Man&quot; with Cage and Tea Leonne.

I have to disagree with vermont k on the location of the games for a playoff.  Have the play down games be separate from the bowl season and play them at the higher ranked team&#039;s home campus in December.  I already hate all the bowl games being played in pro venues with little character (and indoors in some cases).

Once that decides the final game, then let the bowls be played the way they always would.  I would vote to have the championship game always be played in the Rose Bowl.

REPLY - MPC - I am for the bowl games being used - one it will compromise for fat cat bowl directors allowing this playoff to grow. But there will be a problem getting followers to travel to three games.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Raising Arizona.  That roll not only defined &#038; put Nic Cage on the path to the commodity he is, it was his best lead role movie (barely in Fast Times) &#038; a ridiculously funny movie.  Also brought John Goodman to the forefront.

REPLY - MPC - I put Fasttime in their just to show how desperate he is for good movies - never liked Raising Arizona but I know it is appreciated by some]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Champ could stay with Gronk, but what would he do if the ball was thrown high? And what could he do if Gronk used his bulk to screen Champ away from the ball? I hope Broncos try it, because it wouldn&#039;t work, and it would take a cover guy off Welker. 

BCS is leaving a ton of money on the table by not having an 8-team playoff: 7 games, every one critical, four quarterfinals, two semifinals and a final, and every one a ratings bonanza. It would dwarf March Madness. Games could rotate between the existing top 7 bowls, off the top of my head Rose, Fiesta, Orange, Sugar, Peach, Cotton and Poulan Weedeater. OK, just kidding on the last one, but I know there&#039;s one more!
Let the Nos. 9 and 10 teams whine, but that&#039;s a lot better than leaving the likes of Okie State, Oregon, Boise and Stanford on the sidelines.

REPLY - MPC - I think once you go to a plus one it will eventually go to Elite Eight and then in the end to Sweet Sixteen and the money will be piles.]]></description>
