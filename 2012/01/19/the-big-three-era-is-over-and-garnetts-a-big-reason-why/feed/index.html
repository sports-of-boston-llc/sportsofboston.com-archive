		<description><![CDATA[Very fine article.  Well reasoned and well written (which rarely happens nowadays), despite the melancholy subject matter.  Yes, the big 3 era is now just a memory, and watching this aging team is an exercise in masochism.  As a die-hard Celtic fanatic, I must admit that this season will be a very frustrating one to witness, and if Ainge starts dumping the big 3 one by one, ultimately very sad.

I&#039;d like to see more of Brian Moller.  Good job!]]></description>
