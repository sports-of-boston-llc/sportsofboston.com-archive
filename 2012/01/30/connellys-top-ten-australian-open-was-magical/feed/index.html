		<description><![CDATA[Belichick coached Jauron when they were with Detroit. 

Jauron beat out Belichick for coach of the year back in the 2001 reg. season. 

Rice had a great 1978 but couldn&#039;t solve Guidry. The lefty owned Rice. Interesting that both Rice and Guidry had great years, one year after expansion. Mariners and Blue Jays joined in 1977. 

Remember, Bob Ryan&#039;s comments about Jason Kidd&#039;s wife? On Sports Final, oops. 

Ron Franklin got canned because of his comments to Jeannie Edwards at a production meeting in Atlanta. Before the Noles and Gamecocks (irony??) Peach Bowl. 

Father and Sons who played in the Super Bowl. Nice tid-bit for you. 

Tony and his son Anthony, Jackie and now Matthew Slater, Bob Griese played (son Brian didn&#039;t play but dressed), Julius Adams and his son Keith, Frank Cornish and his son Frank. Manu Tuiasosopo (his son Marques dressed but did not play). 

Channel Five&#039;s Mike Lynch was an excellent football player with Swampscott. 

Current secondary coach of the NY Giants (Salem,Ma.) coached at Swampscott High.

REPLY - MPC - How can a guy be coach of the year and then not be a coach / good one on Bob Ryan]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Guidry&#039;s 25th win that year probably should have insured him the MVP as well.

Former Dodger GM Al Campanis shot himself out of a job after his racist comments to Ted Koppel on Nightline.

The Brady cover reminds me of the one of Bird in the late 80&#039;s with a similar facial expression and pose.

REPLY - MPC - Brady - Bird same thing (we&#039;re lucky) / Amazing Guidry didn&#039;t win - has to be top five pitching year ever - Pedro, Gibson, etc]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agree with Tim above.  I blame the rebounding problems on Doc.  I was at last night&#039;s game - outside shot goes up and 5 C&#039;s are retreating back on D.  Only Wicox stayed under to bang.  And the refs gave the game to the Cav&#039;s.  Terible calls in the 4th, with the worst being the no call when Pierce got his man in the air.

REPLY - MPC - I agree it was a foul but Pierce didn&#039;t jump into the guy but away which fooled the ref]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, Kevin Garnett leads the Celtics in rebounds per game and rebounds per minute - so while someone is to blame for their rebounding woes, it is not Kevin Garnett.  When teams struggle, fans sometimes have a mistaken tendency to blame their best players. 


I think it is unfortunate to hear fans and commentators question Garnett&#039;s effort.  There have been very few players in league history that gave as consistent an effort, every night and at both ends of the floor, as Kevin Garnett.  He stands out in this regard.

C&#039;s rebounding woes are nothing new.  I believe they have been consitently outrebounded throughout the &quot;new big three&quot; era.

REPLY - MPC - Garnett is a paper tiger - I saw a ball roll right by him last night and he had no interest on diving on the floor - less banging his chest before the game - don&#039;t forget $21mm should get you at least 18 ppg / 11 reb - He misses Perk more than anyone]]></description>
