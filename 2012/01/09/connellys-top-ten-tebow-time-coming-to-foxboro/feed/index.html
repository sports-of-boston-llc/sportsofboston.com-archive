		<description><![CDATA[Just wondering, is Max Lane the OL coach with LSU? Marc Wilson the qb coach at LSU? Lame game!

REPLY - MPC - Do you think Max Lane is awoke by images of Reggie White - I think Les Miles is terribly underappreciated by their fanbase but that was wierd. ultimately that team wasn&#039;t that good and he did a great job with them. Average offense - a playmaker in the secondardy, a very good line]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Homeland to me was as good as it gets - complete, not worried about the good guys winning every battle, and best of all, a great set up for next season without being a painful/cheap cliffhanger.  But, you can always rent dvds of Might Mouse I guess ;)?

Agree on chest bump.

Best Heisman ever: How about the Patriots guy saying NO to the Colts requesting an interview for the GM job - practically unheard of loyalty to a team.

Drinking games being created as we type around how many times any facet of the &#039;McDaniels at Broncos picking up Tebow and now McD back w/ Pats&#039; info nugget being discussed by announcers.  Vegas over/under 3.16 jillion times.

Ed, Matt Ryan was at home as #1 seed last year and baby-burbed his way through that game.

REPLY-MPC - I would give Homeland a B+ --- i was under the impression it was an A+ - I think Brody is average actor also / Yes great Heisman / Good call on McDaniel theme]]></description>

REPLY - MPC - I agree (but i will say at the beginning of the year I didn&#039;t think LSU had the QB to get this far - I was wrong)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Matty &quot;Ice&quot;---nickname must be dropped! 

All the home teams won this past weekend. 

Mike Mayock, excellent analyst, not many are better. He knows the game! 

Champ Bailey has to make that interception. 

Steelers were daring the Broncos to throw the ball. 

Props to Tomlin, not playing Clark, he might have been the difference. 

Steelers are old on defense, and the OL looks like a bunch of Max Lane&#039;s out there.

REPLY - MPC - Steelers could be in trouble on D they&#039;re tough on offense / I agree on Mayock]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Matt Ryan looked just like Drew Bledsoe on those two failed sneaks.  The Falcons got what they deserved on the second one when they came out with an empty backfield.

Wow, how good was Eddie Shore?

I looked it up, one of those three Celtic losses was to Washington at Harford.  The other two were the Lakers and Trail Blazers.

REPLY - MPC - I remember the Portland loss that was the only one that year - Stinkin Hartford home games thats terrible / Agree on Shore he doesn&#039;t get enough attention for that]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think what Marchand did was a hip check.  I think that he&#039;s a punk who we all would hate if he wasn&#039;t on the Bruins.

Park would throw a hip into someone to knock him down or slow him down - Marchand submarines a guy to be a puke.

I switched to the NFL network to catch Tebow&#039;s post game interview - he&#039;s unbelievable.  Then I remembered why I don&#039;t watch the NFL network - Deonne Sanders is a buffoon who can&#039;t shut up.

REPLY - MPC - Deion I think is a Tebow fan though but I agree on the run on sentences / Do you think the hip check in the Stanley Cup was bad when the guy was running at him?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just watched all 12 Homeland Episodes over the weekend.  Damien Lewis is a great actor, but the rest of the cast and the writing was formula TV 101.  It was like a mediocre season of 24 with boobies and F bombs.

REPLY - MPC - I thought Lewis was fair / the rest was good - we watched all 12 this week also]]></description>
