		<description><![CDATA[IMO, the difference in the game:

2nd quarter: Ravens kick a field goal on 4th and 1.

4th quarter: Patriots go for it on 4th and 1 and score a touchdown.

REPLY - MPC - Can&#039;t go for field goals against Brady]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[-Why does it seem to be a rule that after a turnover if you are in striking distance that you have to throw to the end zone on the following play?  
-Brady has never thrown a good deep ball.  
-You picked on the two funny/sad things in the pregame.  Steven Tyler and a cargo plane for a flyover?  

-We backed in and now play a team that looks clearly like the better team.  Oh well, I will take that &quot;problem&quot; any day.

-Sterling Moore, great story,  due respect to Vince Wilfork but Moore was the player of the game to me.

-Despite what I said in my first comment, we have to make safeties respect something. They feast on knowing we can only throw short and mid-range passes.  

-Belichick and whoever works in the Pats booth have been awful on not challenging plays and leaving points on the field.

-Super Bowl will come down to whether our O-Line can protect Brady. Redemption time fellas!

REPLY - MPC - O Line has been playing well / agree bad deep thrower - the passes to Moss were usual jump balls -]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hope Jim Nantz and Phil Simms rest up for next year. They were both brutal yesterday. Simms mis-called receivers on both sides about 5 times. He also seems to feel a need to speak after every play, not necessarily a good thing.

REPLY - MPC - Seems to be a common critique that they have lost fast ball]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A bomb to Matthew Slater, my oh my. 

Throwing in Ed Reed&#039;s direction (he was covering Hernandez) with the game on the line. Another poor call and equally bad decision. Go to the other side of the field and go far away from Reed. 

Cundiff and Evans, how do they walk into that lockeroom and get on the team plane? 

Patrick Willis was the best player yesterday. He was all over the field. He&#039;s another Ray Lewis. 

SF needs to get some wide receivers.

REPLY - MPC - Interesting piece on Willis leaving his father on ESPN / If I&#039;m Cundiff I find a charity and donate yesterday&#039;s check]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[this rematch will be the most hyped game in superbowl history.  hoping it lives up to it and pats get some revenge.

brady will be better in superbowl.  has to be, right?  i thought he had fine protection for the most part (solder, not withstanding) so the performance was mostly on him.  terrible game.

if it stays at 3, anyone looking to make $$$ needs to go with giants - too many possibilities.  thus, don&#039;t even bother betting and just root as hard as possible for the patriots.

REPLY - MPC - Line will down to 1/2 by kickoff]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not to mention the fact that the intended receiver was Slater on the interception.

Surprised to see a line out while Gronk&#039;s status may be up in the air

Loved the hit Gronk made on Suggs very early.  Suggs was pretty quiet after that.

REPLY - MPC - Giants are better team and playing better right now / Suggs a no show - no way can Brady throw that pass]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You can debate the &quot;call&quot; after the interception and where the call came from, but the decision to throw into that coverage and the throw itself were shockingly bad.

Props on your call on Joe P.

Has anyone seen Joe Flaco and Freddie Mercury in the same room at the same time?

REPLY - MPC - Joe Flaco not singing We Are the Champion / Brady trying to make a big splash and we would have been talking about it for twenty years if they lost]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No question that Brady was shaky at best.  Frustrating that they ran the ball well early and then seemed to get away from it.  

Agree that the Brady INT was one of the worst calls ever.  

Was it O&#039;Brien or Brady making that call?  Pats had all the momentum after the spikes pick and threw it away.  They could have put game away.

Regardless, Pats have had 3 punch in the stomach playoff losses (Colts, Giants, and Jets).  They were due to win a game like this.  They found a way and that is all that matters!

REPLY - MPC - Would have been a demolition derby on 128 if they lost / Brady can&#039;t throw that pass]]></description>
