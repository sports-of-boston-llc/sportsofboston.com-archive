		<description><![CDATA[Kudos to Thomas for exercizing his right to free speech and voicing his disapproval of the ills of the current political situation.  

Unfortunately, very few other athletes (Ali, Jim Brown, Bill Russell are some notable exceptions) have taken similar stands, but those that have made their goals clear.  

I anxiously await Thomas&#039; next move, which should be suggesting the constructive, corrective remedies for the ills he vaguely identified.  A duty, by the way, which is incumbent upon all of us as American citizens.

It takes courage to point out things that are wrong, especially when the stakes are high; it takes even greater resolve to fix them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After reading numerous posts on the net and seeing so many negative comments, it is clear people have lost site of what&#039;s at stake. Over the last 50 years (at first gradually) we have been subject to more and more &#039;legislated&#039; laws which have reduced our freedoms.

The roots of our freedoms (maxims in law - our inherent common (sense) laws) and how to preserve them (the court process) w/ education isn&#039;t common knowledge and we are paying the price as the minds of the populace have been &#039;programed&#039; for conformity. They &quot;say&quot; our freedoms our under attack (without evidence) by outside sources, but I see it more from within.

TT said it plain and simple and so many are taking this out of context. We need people to open their minds up and realize that a revolution IS taking place and either enough people are going to stand up and reclaim our common law heritage or see it disappear for good and become enslaved by the corporate elite who are running the show behind the curtain (the bible states that money is the root of all evil ).

Solution: Truly have governments of the people, by the people, for the people (not corporations - aka: persons, yes persons, look it up in any law dictionary) and create an interest free currency (sovereign dollar?) and stop using the elite&#039;s currency (yes, it&#039;s theirs).

Remember your history people, and for once, let&#039;s not make it repeat itself. This is critical with the technology that is now in place at this time in human history.

&quot;The people can always be brought to the bidding of their leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.&quot; ~ Nazi Reich Marshall Hermann Goering, at the Nuremberg War Trials

Good for you Tim for standing up and being true to yourself. More of a fan now than ever before. Your playing in a city with great history, hopefully the majority remembers that history and doesn&#039;t conform - and supports you all the way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Everybody&#039;s entitled to their opinion, including Tim Thomas. Have to say though that I am disappointed. There is a scene in Band of Brothers where a deposed captain fails to salute another officer who outranks him, because he took his job. The officer stops him and says, &quot;Captain, we salute the rank, not the man.&quot; This is the president of the US, he should have gone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am not a fan of the Tea Party or Mr. Beck. I am a fan of people who can protest with words correctly. After many aggravating speeches to come out since 2009, I feel Mr. Thomas did a great job.If he would have gone haywire like Hank Jr. and his outrageous rant then maybe there should be some penalty. Hockey is a gentle mans sport after all. Great victory in 2011. Thank you Jeff Miller]]></description>
