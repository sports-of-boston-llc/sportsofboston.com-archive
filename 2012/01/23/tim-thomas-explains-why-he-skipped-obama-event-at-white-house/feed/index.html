		<description><![CDATA[Good for the great one! They could not pay me enough to shake hands with any of these traitors! What he did is his business and he is more then right we are a country of slaves and I for one am tired of it! If it wasn&#039;t for Thomas the bully&#039;s would not be there to start with. And what does Obama know or care about hockey? I think he stood up were his team-mates did not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tim is who he is.  Tim loves his country by exercising his individual right. This can only happen on the land of the United States of America. Nothing wrong for Tim for making his choice. I admire people who have back bones. Hate some people like the Chinese who drop their knees so easiely.  Could Tim do this in a better way, before he did this,  consider the impact on his future play and on his team? of course. Tim is my herio. Long live freedom!]]></description>
