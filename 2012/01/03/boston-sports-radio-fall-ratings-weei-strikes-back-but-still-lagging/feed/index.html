		<description><![CDATA[It feels like you were channeling me while reading your piece on Boston sports talk radio. I absolutely loathe Andy Gresh and have since he was on in Rhode Island. Every adjective you used to describe him was spot on. He can&#039;t be fired fast enough for me. My feelings for Toucher and Rich, while not as harsh, aren&#039;t far away. Are you sure their demo isn&#039;t 12-18yr old boys? I find them boorish and beyond childish.  I didn&#039;t  know Ordway took that much of a financial hit...He has clearly seen his best days pass him by.  I find Felger both annoying and extremely  entertaining at times... Mazz, not so much..His grating voice and constant negativity have become old very fast..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Completely agree w/ Dan - Felger needs somebody else to challenge him more aggressively.  He&#039;s very good when he&#039;s very good but he clearly sometimes takes &quot;contrarian controversial&quot; positions whether he really believes them or not as a buzz strategy like a shock jock just to stimulate angry callers.  He needs somebody to call him out on that stuff and Curran or Perrillo (and Beetle sometimes) do this well. Mazz is far too much of a pandering subservient sidekick. 

EEI management are clearly idiots on the other hand so the competition isn&#039;t really too challenging yet.  The way they completely abandoned the afternoon show format when they tanked for a copy-cat &quot;2 co-host&quot; model was idiotic.  Especially when the Ordway/Holley chemistry obviously sucked.  Sometimes the disdain between them was palpable (actually pretty amusing at times).  What made the EEI afternoon show unique and interesting all along was the regular rotation of writers/athletes/media-figures in the guest co-host slots.  Fully agree sometimes those guys would be arrogant and the show needed some shakeup and for their arrogance to be challenged, but the way to respond to competition isn&#039;t to abandon everything that makes you successful and try to blindly copy your new competition.  You can see they realized this as they&#039;ve gone back to bringing the jocks and writers in for partial shows, but the damage was done already.  Hey, Wolfe: Lesson 1 - don&#039;t wait until you are on death&#039;s door to take action, Lesson 2 - when you do take action, be a heck of a lot smarter than just &quot;uh better copy what they are doing&quot;. 

But it is great to see D&#038;C&#039;s hatefest in the tank.  Can&#039;t wait until it comes around to contract renewal time for those guys and see if one or both of them finally gets bounced...  I don&#039;t care what your politics are, nobody needs every sports and news story to be twisted into a ranting condemnation of Obama and liberal politics.  Not why we listen to sports radio, idiots.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree that arrogance has played a role on Felger &#038; Mazz.  The show has declined the less they take callers, but I try on EEI at that time and find it disjointed and low quality.  Felger &#038; Mazz should take a little bit of the charm of Fred and show some humility.  I personally cannot stand Mikey and find DA decent, Mother Ship does provide some smart discussion now and then at least.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My main problem with Mikey is not really the silliness. He has the inverse problem that George described for DA. He has no grasp of sports outside of old timey Boston teams. He clearly does not keep up with current sports events.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I mostly agree though I have 2 slightly differing opinions:

1) I attribute Felger&#039;s decline more to Mazz than arrogance with success. Felger is at his best when constantly challenged, as evidenced when he works with Holley on CSNNE. If Felger was paired with some like Tom E. Curran or &quot;Sunshine&quot; Paul Perrillo I think the show would improve immensely. I agree that Holley is the optimal partner but think that is a pipe dream. 

2) I significantly prefer DA over Mikey. Both shows are gimmicky but my perception is that DA actually puts a concentrated effort into his show whereas Planet Mikey is completely bereft of informative opinions and effort behind its content.]]></description>
