		<description><![CDATA[I have to rank Kobe as the Greatest 2 Guard of all time above Michael jordan for the reason that Michael jordan had a career full of weak matchups in the vein of Craig Ehlo, John Starks, Bryon Russell, and Danny Ainge...Any thoughts on this particular matter?

REPLY - MPC - There is no way Kobe is better than Michael Jordan / who are you putting #1 Oscar Robertson? / Jordan is the greatest scorer - greatest defender from guard position]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How do you envision Howard coming to Boston?  As a free agent?  Not happening.  Though, I imagine when he sees a team of scrubs led by 2 very old future HoF&#039;ers fight back from 27 down to beat his current team, he gets a little envious.

At this point, I would not be opposed to Howard coming here... BUT, I do think he&#039;s one of those guys that&#039;s never going to win a ring.]]></description>
