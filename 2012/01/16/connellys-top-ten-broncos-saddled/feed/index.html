		<description><![CDATA[Just wondering, is Larry Coker the worst coach to win a National Championship? Of course, he won with Buth Davis&#039; players, like Tubby Smith did at Kentucky with Pitino&#039;s kids.

REPLY - MPC - Theres been some bad coaches that have been brought along the road by a great team - Coker one of them. Can&#039;t see his message getting across to Miami players &quot;shut up old man&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pats took Daniel Graham a few picks ahead of Ed Reed, wish we could have that one back. 

I never understood why Reed went that late in the draft, he was all over the field when he played for the Canes. 

Last game for CBS for a while, thank heaven! Simms and Nantz are lame. 

Best game the &quot;D&quot; played in over a year. Lots and lots of blue jerseys around the ball. 

I thought at sometime NE would miss Andre Carter, but not yet.

When NE drafted Gronk, I heard Jason Whitten comparisons, that&#039;s an insult now. 

Why do announcers say &quot;slow to get up&quot; when a player is laying down on the ground. Whenever they say that, the player is usually laying down and waiting for the medical staff.

REPLY - MPC - Wonder if Miami whispers caused Reed to fall / Gronk is beyond comparison amazingly]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Branch was being grabbed when he pushed off, good no call. Gronk might have gotten away with one, but that play is rarely called, and defensive player was also making contact way more than five yards downfield. Probably OK no call, too.

REPLY - MPC - I like your unbiased perspective - wish you were reffing on Sunday]]></description>
