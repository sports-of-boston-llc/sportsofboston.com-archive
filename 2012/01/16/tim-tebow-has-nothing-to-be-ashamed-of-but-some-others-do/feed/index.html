		<description><![CDATA[I guess people forget that Tim Tebow is very young and hasn&#039;t been playing in the NFL that long. He has displayed a lot of potential and success, history will tell. It&#039;s funny that in every hurdle the sports critics kept saying he was done and time and time he proof them to be wrong. Wasn&#039;t the Steelers the team that was supposed to end him? Taking a team with a very small margin of chance to the playoffs, isnt that enough proof to the critics that he is talented? It almost looks like the media wanted him to failed. That&#039;s alright there is a lot of people out there that thinks otherwise despite what the media said. Great season Tim Tebow keep it up!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tim Tebow is genuinely a good person. But neither life nor the media is unfair to him. When you are pushing a message (which he chooses to do), then you can expect not everyone will agree with your message and some may push back. And even though he had a decent season, some may not agree that he is a great quarterback. That&#039;s the way sports work. When you work in a business that is basically entertainment, you have to expect people will talk about you. If they didn&#039;t, there would be no NFL.

So you can drop the entire &quot;holier than thou&quot; attitude, because you are not. You are simply a sportswriter with a different opinion, and no better or worse than all of the other sportswriters and sports fans.]]></description>
