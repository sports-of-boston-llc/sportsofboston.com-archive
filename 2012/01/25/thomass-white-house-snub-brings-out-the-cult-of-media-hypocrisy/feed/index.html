		<description><![CDATA[And I too have made a choice...I&#039;m not waching any more Bruins games.
I actually saw Bobby Orr&#039;s famous flying goal and cannot imagine him snubbing the President of the United State...no mater what his skin color was.
Timmy Thomas is a boy in a man&#039;s body and he should be cut from the roster and unitl the Bruins are Thomas free...I will not watch them anymore!!!
TO HECK WITH TIM THOMAS AND THE BRUINS!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hope you&#039;ll pardon me for going a little OT, George, but I&#039;m struck by the irony of the reactions to Thomas&#039; decision to decline his White House invitation.  Those on the Left, which pretty much invented and supported this type of behavior during the Sixties- and the presidencies of Nixon, Reagan and Bush- are now quite outraged that someone would so disrespect the office of the President when one of their own is in that position.  The Right, which condemned this sort of behavior on prior occasions, is now justifying Thomas&#039; decision and disparaging those who would criticize him.  

Couldn&#039;t we all agree that it would have been more appropriate if Thomas had accepted his invitation, but that it&#039;s also not that big a deal that he didn&#039;t?  He&#039;s still doing a pretty good job in net, stopping pucks and helping keep the Bruins one of the best teams in the NHL.  And isn&#039;t that what we really expect of him?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[See,NSR, you make the knee jerk comment on my response to a...nonsense comment concerning another...President of the US.  Apparently your feelings only get hurt when it&#039;s your partisan ideology taking the hit.  Follow the yellow brick road in your fantasy land and ask the wizard for some courage...and a brain. Unlike you I think both TT and Theo Epstein should have gone to the White House when invited.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[lol @ the uppity Bostonian brownshirts who think it&#039;s okay to snub Bush but not the Dear Leader Obamao.  There&#039;s nothing more pathetic than worshiping a failed politician.

You people have chugged so much koolaid you are beyond help.  

Thomas didn&#039;t go and that&#039;s his right.  Or maybe you&#039;d like him stalked and slandered for the rest of his life like the left did Palin for being a conservative.  Maybe one of you deranged foaming out the mouth liberals with daggers in your eyes over this can move in next to Thomas&#039; house and spy on his children like you did Palin.  

After all--he must be punished for daring to exercise his first and fifth amendment rights.  

Because that&#039;s what you do to people who dare disagree with you.  You punish them in every vile way you can within the confines of the law.  Good for you you are all real patriots to your country.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And if you don&#039;t agree that being a player has something to do with it, versus being a GM, when was the last time a President humorously called out a General Manager or any other executive in one of those White House ceremonies?  No one cares about a GM.  

This was an episode of Conservative and Liberal asshats and wannabe uber-objective journalists making a huge deal out of equivalence that doesn&#039;t exist.....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Everyone has a real short memory.

After the 2008 visit, it was a huge controversy that Manny didn&#039;t go.  Mainly because they also went to Walter Reed.  This overshadowed Theo not going, but that was talked about, including the likely reason, very heavily on the radio airwaves. I&#039;m pretty sure not being a player has something to do with it too.

Just because the Boston Herald only carried an AP article that didn&#039;t mention Theo, doesn&#039;t mean the firestorm didn&#039;t happen.

Cain&#039;s desperate attempt to come off as objective misses the boat here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A a registered Independent Massachusetts voter and fan of both the Red Sox and the Bruins, I say that both Theo and Tim Thomas should have appeared with their teams.  However Theo&#039;s behavior was far worse in that he said highly derogatory things about Bush, whereas Thomas  said nothing at all derogatory about O&#039;Bama.  Furthermore Theo did it twice and he was the GM, not a player.  The bottom line is that the media is almost totally biased and that is why Theo got a free ride and why Thomas is getting fried.

I agree that Felger is a left leaning bomb thrower but am glad to hear Mazz apologized.  Sorry I missed it.]]></description>

Thomas is a cowardly bum like you. You just hate any America that doesn&#039;t agree with you 100 percent.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[David,
I have been around pro sports teams and watched a team almost get into a fist fight after a practice over who&#039;s wife sat next to who.  It was crazy.  I have no doubt that the team likes what TT has to offer on the ice but do you honestly think they wanted to answer for what he did.  I heard Neely&#039;s interview and he was clearly annoyed by the whole thing.  Save the lecture on how pro sports work.  You are accountable on and off the field, court, ice whatever.  Thomas made a team issue about him and that is just wrong.]]></description>
