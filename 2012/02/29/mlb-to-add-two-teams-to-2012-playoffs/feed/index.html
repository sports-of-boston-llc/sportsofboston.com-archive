		<description><![CDATA[hawkny - Where are your sources for that? That seems a little far-fetched of a scenario, if you ask me.

Dan - Thanks! Always love to get feedback from readers.

john - I hear what you&#039;re saying. But like you said, that was the case before adding another wild card, and those wild card teams didn&#039;t seem to suffer much. The &#039;05 &#039;Stros, &#039;06 Tigers, and &#039;07 Rockies all made it to the World Series, and the &#039;08 Red Sox and &#039;10 Yankees went to the ALCS. I don&#039;t see it as a punishment for the WC, but a reward for division winners. After all, a division title should mean something besides just a banner flying above the field the following season. If you can&#039;t beat the teams in your own division, you should have to work a little harder, I think. That&#039;s why we see the unbalanced schedules.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nick, 
I disagree. This hurts the wild card winners and benefits the division winners. However, that isn&#039;t right because often the wild car winner has more wins than at least one division winner. Why should they be punished for having a harder division, while still doing better? These are the years this took place. 2010-Yankees, 2009- Red sox and Rockies, 2008- Red Sox and Brewers, 2007-Rockies, 2006-Tigers and Dodgers, 2005- Astros. I think I have made my point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What MLB is not telling fans is this expansion to a ten team playoff format is an interim step that will lead to a 12- team playoff arrangement.  This will occur when MLB expands from 30 operating franchises to 32 in the next year, two or three.  Once 32 teams (presumably made up of four 8-team divisions regionally paired up) three teams in each division will make it to the playoffs.  In this arrangement,  the runner up and third place team will play a best of 5 series to play the regular season winner in a 7-game set.  the winner will go to the World Series where the best W/L record will be matched up against the 4th best, etc...]]></description>
