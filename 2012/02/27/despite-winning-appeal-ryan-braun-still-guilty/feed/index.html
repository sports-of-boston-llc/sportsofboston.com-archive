		<description><![CDATA[You nailed it. Once he won his appeal, the media&#039;s slobbering love affair with him really repulsed me. They cited his workout statistics and compared times it took him to leg out doubles, this past season and years ago, as if that&#039;s conclusive. Only you have cited his late season surge. Having engineered a trade for him last summer in my Fantasy Baseball league, I am keenly aware of the way he finished the season. I would imagine that (August - October) was the best stretch of his career. Not to mention, coming into this season, his career numbers, for whatever reason, were declining. 2010 was the first season that he failed to hit 30 home runs and his slugging percentage was 50 points less than his worst year. It seems he had a motive to synthetically address &#039;10&#039;s problems in &#039;11.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The league can make this a win-win for everybody by saying--look, the appeals process works and we don&#039;t want any question about the integrity of our process, so we will live with the results. It&#039;s stupid for the league to fight about it when it&#039;s clear the handler completely messed things up. They could also add in, &quot;we are still convinced that the result is correct,  but in order to have a fair system--to our players, the league and the fans--we have to follow due process and, in this instance, that did not happen.&quot;]]></description>
