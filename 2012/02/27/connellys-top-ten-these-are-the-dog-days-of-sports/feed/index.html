		<description><![CDATA[So what do you think, does Josh Beckett get roundly booed by the Fenway crowd on opening day?  I can&#039;t be the only one that is really turned off by his attitude, and the faithful are certainly disappointed about last year.  I wonder how he will deal with it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In his rookie year last season, an 18/19-year old Tyler Seguin had 11-goals &#038; 11-assists for 22-points in the regular season.  So far in his second season, a 19/20-year old Tyler Seguin has 20-goals &#038; 28-assists for 48-points, with 22-games remaining in the season. How does that make him &quot;a player with potential that is not being fulfilled&quot;?  Not only that, he is becoming much better defensively, as another reader posted recently.  I know that a big reason is Peverley&#039;s absence, but the other night in Ottawa, Seguin was on the ice in the final minute with the B&#039;s clinging to a 1-goal lead.  That never would have happened last year.  

He&#039;s very young.  I think his progress is fine.  If he went to college, he would only be a sophomore.]]></description>
