I&#039;ve always felt DeOssie is a clown and his actions backed my thoughts about him. I can&#039;t believe he used the word &quot;struggle.&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[Jump shot, jump shot, and more jump shots for the Celtics last night. 

KG has the worst shot selection I have ever seen. I have always felt Baby Davis was bad. 

I think Ridley could be that back, he&#039;s very physical. He&#039;ll have to come out of the Belichick doghouse though. Will Belichick have a change in philosphy with his offense? 

Good call on Pietrus, he does resemble X-Man.

Agree with Orange Julius about Buckley&#039;s column, one of the worst ever in Boston. The Herald should be ashamed!

REPLY - MPC - The comments are funny after Buck&#039;s article - thats an accomodation for S.D. - know one cares he rooted or picked Giants - its that he&#039;s from Roslindale for crying out loud and NY is his &quot;home&quot; now and he struggles up here - what?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[-MPC did you see Buckley&#039;s pathetic defense of DeOssie? He conveniently leaves out DeOssie&#039;s words.  

-Celtics on final possession has been a joke for 5 years now.  Pierce wants to be the hero, holds the ball 3-4 seconds too long and then settles for 25 foot fade aways.  On the + side at least he doesn&#039;t dribble the ball of his knee in traffic on final possesions like he used.

REPLY - MPC - Buck&#039;s piece not great - it was an effort to help out but missed.]]></description>
