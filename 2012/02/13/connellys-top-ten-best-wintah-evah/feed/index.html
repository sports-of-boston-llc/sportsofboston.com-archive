		<description><![CDATA[Whoa! KG 30th or 40th?!?  You got him pegged way too low!  Former MVP; NBA champion; 14 time All Star; 4 time All-NBA first teamer; 9 time All-NBA defensive first teamer; 4 time NBA rebounding champ...  Those accomplishments suggest a rank somewhere say 15-20th all time, which is right about where he would rank in Win Shares, PER and other stathead type stuff.  Whether or not he spent a lot of time with his back to the basket is not really that relevant.  After all, as your list shows, the Celtics have won 17 NBA titles despite having had just one excellent post player.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One of my favorite parts of the Super Bowl&#039;s National Anthem was when they showed some of the the players rocking back &#038; forth with nerves &#038; adrenaline - understandably so.  Then they briefly cut to a Marine base in Afghanistan. The Marines were completely still as they stood at attention for the Anthem.  I thought they looked so focused &#038; respectful.  Very  impressive.

I agree the Canadian Anthem is a great anthem.  I really like Russia&#039;s anthem, too.  It&#039;s actually the old anthem for the Soviet Union.  After the Soviet Union broke up, Russia came up with a new anthem, but the people hated it.  So, Russia brought back the old Soviet Union anthem as the &#039;new&#039; anthem for Russia.  I don&#039;t speak any Russian, so if any of the words translate to &quot;Die, All Capitalist Pigs&quot;, I renounce it in advance.  I just like the way it sounds.  Here&#039;s a link if anyone wants to hear it.

		<description><![CDATA[I was at the AT&#038;T.  Belicheck wore the hoodie but didn&#039;t cut the sleeves.  He roled them up, to look like they were cut.  Too bad, cut would have been more classic.  BB was one of the most gracious of all pros and celebs.  I was surprised how popular he was and saw him sign more autographs than anyone else.  Always upbeat and played good too!  Good show Bill!

REPLY - MPC - Good to hear - why not enjoy the fruits of his hard work and accomplishments]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dino Radja and Ryan Gomes?  Are you alright?  Glen Davis was better in the paint than those two, and than ain&#039;t sayin&#039; much.

REPLY - MPC - Gomes had a great low post game and would routinely post people up - Dino would be perfect on this team]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;JaJuan Johnson has a little Ed Pickney in him&quot; - is that good or bad?

Sure the C&#039;s have no post game, but they have never had a post game during the &quot;new big 3&quot; era.  They are and have been a jump shooting team, whose true calling card is half court defense.  Your list of Celtics post players suggests to me that you don&#039;t have to have a great one to win titles.

REPLY - MPC - If you have a low post game its helpful for getting to the line / open up the outside and not rely on outside if shooters are cold - too bad Garnett didn&#039;t perfect the drop step or hook shot - he would be on my top ten list of all time instead of 30th-40th]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The last reg. season game at Boston Garden against the Knicks, the national anthem had Bruce Hornsby at the piano and Branford Marsalis with the sax. Excellent job! 

Great effort by the Bulls, a testament to their head coach Tom Thibodeau. Last game of a very long road trip and the Bulls were playing without their star D. Rose. Chicago could have packed it in, especially down the stretch. 

Fat Lever had has fair amount of triple doubles.

REPLY - MPC - Fat Lever my alltime underrated list / Branford has skills]]></description>
