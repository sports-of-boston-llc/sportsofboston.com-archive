		<description><![CDATA[-Agree that Celts are toast but also kind of agree that they showed just keep the guys for cap space purposes.  What would they get for Garnett anyway?  Not much.

REPLY - MPC - Howard obviously changes a team dramatically how about him and Marcus Camby for cheap money combined with Pierce, Rondo -]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Put a fork in the Celtics, they are done like dinner. Ainge has to pull the trigger on a deal or two and look towards the future. Clear cap space, that should be the theme for the green this year! 

If you have ever heard Joe Magrane broadcast a game (he did tv work for the TB Devil Rays/Rays) you would call him Joe &quot;Migrane&quot; because that is what he gives his viewers. Awful announcer, almost as bad as Joe Morgan. 

Jordan Sparks(won American Idol) daughter of Phillipi Sparks. 

Worst part of game 6, time change that night, fall back. 


Keith Hernandez drinking a beer in Davey Johnson&#039;s office while the Mets are coming back. I hated that 86 Mets team! Especially Dykstra, obviously before he did roids.

REPLY - MPC - Good point on daylight savings / Dykstra was insane all juiced out against the Blue Jays / Worst thing about Celts is that they are saying they&#039;re smarter to hang onto Jermaine, Garnett and Allen and use their cap space for summer which means we&#039;re stuck with an old .500 team - history repeating itself - hanging onto the aging Big Three too long]]></description>
