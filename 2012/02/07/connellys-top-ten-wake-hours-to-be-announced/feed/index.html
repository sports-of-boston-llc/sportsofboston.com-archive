		<description><![CDATA[Greatest run ever in the NCAA Tournament was NC State. They had to win the ACC tourney to qualify. Terry Gannon was big that game. Michael Young (1st rd. pick--didn&#039;t make it with the Celtics) Rick Carlisle did instead. Larry Micheaux (Mr. Mean) another Celtics draft choice.

REPLY - MPC - They were the ultimate team of destiny]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hernandez&#039;s drop was a good thing. If he makes the catch, he&#039;s wrapped up at the 30 yard line immediately. 

Welker and Brady, 50-50 split. Throw could have been better but he should have made the catch.

Nickovich being off-sides, &quot;killed&quot; the Patriots. For some reason people are not talking about that enough. Also that throw to Branch, he could have ran to Fort Wayne after making that catch. Another bad throw by Brady. 

Why throw to Gronkowski down field? Bad decision and an awful throw. 

Why Belichick challenged the Mannigham catch is beyond me. It happened right in front of him. 

12 men on the field was another &quot;killer.&quot; What bothers me about that the most, normally when you have 12 men on the field, you&#039;ll see a player trying to run off the field. Obviously, that didn&#039;t happen. Dumb!

Sterling Moore--no way was that pass interference, given the situation. Great play by Moore, the kid has a knack for the ball. 

Also, Chung was late on the Mannigham catch, let&#039;s not forget that. If he(Chung) was there on time, he would have lit up Manningham. Chung was late because Manning did a great job looking the other way and Chung had to hold his ground. 

Mankins stunk against the Giants in Arizona and was equally bad in Indy the other night. Time for him to head elsehwere. 

Oh by the way, Brandon Lloyd will look good in NE next year and beyond. NE needs that outside deep threat. 

Of course, a pass rusher would be nice but I&#039;ve been asking for that for years now. 

A healthy Gronkowsi, NE wins..no doubt!

REPLY - MPC - Branch run and catch would have been the greatest play in Super Bowl history / I agree Hernandez drop didn&#039;t hurt accept it caused third down which led to sack and timeout and was choke / Sterling Moore has some Assante in him / You are right good look off by Manning / Mankins should donate his check for that game / I can&#039;t believe they lost - ugh]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Again, I agree that some “ticky-tack” penalties can be ignored in a big game or situation. I don’t think that can be the case on a scoring play, in which there is no doubt that a penalty occurred. A safety is a scoring play. I think that is the difference in your B’s-Tampa Game-7 comparisons.  Correct me if I’m wrong, but I don’t recall any obvious scoring opportunities that were denied due to a penalty that was not called in Game-7 of the Lightening series.  For example, Lucic was not cross-checked from behind as he was about to bang in a rebound to an empty corner, nor was Stamkos ever tripped from behind on as he was about to receive a pass on a 2-on-1.  I don’t recall any of those kinds of plays in that game (but I could be wrong).  There may have been a hold in the corner when there was a scrum for the puck, but I don’t recall any definitive scoring opportunities being denied because an obvious penalty occurred &#038; was not called.

Brady “grounded” the ball to avoid a sack in the end zone, which would have been a safety = 2-points. I think they had to call it. It was an obvious grounding penalty.  It’s not like the good non-interference call on Sterling Moore, when his left hand may (or may not) have been on the receiver a split second before the ball arrived.  Let me ask you a question.  Assume there was a long pass by Eli to the end zone where one of the Patriots defensive backs never looked for the ball, wiped out the receiver, &#038; contact occurred obviously before the ball’s arrival (we saw a lot of those this season).  Don’t you think they would have to call defensive pass interference?  That would most likely result in 6-points, as opposed to the safety for 2-points.  Other than that, what’s the difference?  They were obvious penalties that had direct effects on the score of the game.

Again, I think it’s all on Brady for the safety.  He made a meathead play.  He had lots of time before Tuck arrived to either move out of the pocket or throw the ball away before Tuck got there, when he was not “facing an imminent loss of yardage due to pressure from the defense”.

REPLY - MPC - Definitely can make a point either way - I wouldn&#039;t have made that call but thats me - now if we were in Germany I would have the top bunk]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The ball hit Welker on both hands. He has to hang on. 

I don&#039;t understand your point on the grounding call - &quot;unnecessary considering the situation&quot;(?).  The officials have to be fair to both teams, and Brady was clearly throwing the ball away.  Giants would have had a beef had it not been called.

As for whether it&#039;s appropriate for Brady to call out the organization - hey, Brady himself needs to start playing better in the big games!

REPLY - MPC - Don&#039;t want Brady to call out anyone but himself and get even better / big 2 points no doubt / would have been a great catch]]></description>
