		<description><![CDATA[I have no doubt of that, Mr. Stout. But I still think she began the process with a more tightly defined goal than previous volume editors, and her intro reflects that. And let me just say, I&#039;m a huge fan of your series. My own writing abilities have expanded and improved greatly because of all the different kinds of writing BASW has exposed me to. Thanks!]]></description>
