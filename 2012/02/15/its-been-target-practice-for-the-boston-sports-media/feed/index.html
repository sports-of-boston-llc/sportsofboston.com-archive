		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for that promotion Mr. Lucchino. 

True, this ownership team has done a great job overall, but the ship seems rudderless right now and for people who profess to be into all the details of running the team, the ownership has taken a decidedly hands off approach to the disaster of last September. If it all turns around in 2012, all will be forgiven, but until then, they have a lot of pressure on them. And, by the way, Fenway is a nicer atmosphere, but it&#039;s still a grossly overpriced dump.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The only people who can trash John Henry are young people who don&#039;t remember what it was like around here for several decades or pink-hatters. Red Sox fans (REAL Red Sox fans) know we&#039;ve been lucky to have John Henry as owner. He&#039;s built a great management team and has invested heavily in the team by improving the quality of players (we no longer have to play second fiddle to the yankees for top FA&#039;s), he&#039;s invested heavily in improving Fenway which makes it nicer to watch a game and don&#039;t forget that fans, the media and Sox players are in a brand new state-of-the-art spring training facility complex in Florida. I remember when fans were hoping a local owner would buy the team from the Yawkeys. Can you imagine if Frank McCourt bought the Red Sox? I guarantee you we wouldn&#039;t be competitive every single year and we wouldn&#039;t have those 2 World Championships. So the media should think twice before they trash Henry. I&#039;m afraid he wakes-up one day and asks himself who needs this nonsense from the Boston media and decides to sell the team. We couldn&#039;t find a better owner.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What a crock. I actually agree with Thomas&#039; position on this one issue politically, but he put it out there on Facebook and his page is a public page, so don&#039;t give me the nonsense that it was a private post. Once he does that, he&#039;s opening himself up to questions, whether he likes it or not. If he won&#039;t answer them, then the media are going to ask everybody else in the organization about it. 

He&#039;s a public figure (forget the Bruins--look at the credit card and Arbella commercials), so once you put yourself out there so publicly, you have to answer for what you say. 

By the way, also, if he stopped the puck more consistently, a lot of this attention might go away. He&#039;s been very inconsistent the last month, as has most every other Bs player]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Red Sox are an abomination illustrated by the unrepentant Josh Beckett. The sniping already directed toward Valentine regarding the more rigorous nature of this Spring Training is evidence of how pampered and pompus many players on this team are. I, for one, cannot and will not root for this team. The only thing I look forward to this baseball season is the fenway pseudo-sellout streak coming to an end.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[DuPont and Felger are gutless cowards in their attacks on Thomas. They&#039;re typical left wing media who just want to demean anyone who do not see the world as they do. The only ones who think it&#039;s a distraction are other left win lunatics who feel &quot;hurt&quot; and want to make Thomas look bad.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Greg:

You miss the point on Thomas completely. It&#039;s a distraction every time it comes up and neither he nor Rask have played well of late (notable exception, Thomas was outstanding vs. the Caps). If things were going well, it would be done by now, but they are not, and it&#039;s a distraction. I&#039;m a fan and so don&#039;t presume to know what I think--because what I think is that perhaps Thomas bit off more than he can chew in this instance and now is very defensive, which means his focus is less than it needs to be at his job. He&#039;s not the only one who&#039;s not playing great, but he&#039;s the only one who chose to make very public statements about his core beliefs and then refused to expand on those very public statements. That&#039;s distracting, plain and simple.]]></description>
