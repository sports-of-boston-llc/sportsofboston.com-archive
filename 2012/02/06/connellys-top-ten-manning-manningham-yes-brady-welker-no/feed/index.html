		<description><![CDATA[I agree that some &quot;ticky-tack&quot; penalties can be ignored in a big game or situation.  I don&#039;t think that can be the case on a scoring play, in which there is no doubt that a penalty occurred. A safety is a scoring play. 

Brady &quot;grounded&quot; the ball to avoid a sack in the end zone, which would have been a safety.  I think they had to call it.  Again, I think it&#039;s all on Brady.  He had lots of time before Tuck arrived to either move out of the pocket or throw the ball away before Tuck got there, &#038; he was not “facing an imminent loss of yardage due to pressure from the defense”.

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s the NFL official intentional grounding rule: 

&quot;Intentional grounding will be called when a passer, facing an imminent loss of yardage due to pressure from the defense, throws a forward pass without a realistic chance of completion. 
Intentional grounding will not be called when a passer, while out of the pocket and facing an imminent loss of yardage, throws a pass that lands at or beyond the line of scrimmage, even if no offensive player(s) have a realistic chance to catch the ball (including if the ball lands out of bounds over the sideline or end line).&quot; 



 I think safety was the right call.  Brady was in the &quot;tackle box&quot; or pocket.  He threw the pass to avoid the sack by Tuck (&quot;facing an imminent loss of yardage due to pressure from the defense&quot;). There was no Pats receiver in sight of that pass.  

The sad thing is that Brady had plenty of time on the play before Tuck actually  arrived.  Brady had options.  He had to have that clock in his head saying he could not hold on to the ball for too long.  He could have just thrown the ball away before there was any pressure (&quot;facing an imminent loss of yardage due to pressure from the defense&quot;),or he could rolled out of the pocket, continued to look for an open receiver, &#038; then thrown it away when he felt pressure.

I think the play showed incredibly bad situational awareness by Brady.  If Eli had done that, everyone would say that he was stupid, &#038; Brady was much too smart to do something like that.  Too bad.  I thought Brady was brilliant for much of the rest of the game, but those 2-points played an important role in the closing minutes.

REPLY - MPC - I agree by the letter of the law it was the proper call but there wre also letter of law calls ignoredin game 7 of Tampa]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[- Wes Welker meet Asante Samuel
sorry Welker has to make that catch-he had both hands on it -he makes that catch 95 times out of 100 - was it a perfect throw? -no it wasn&#039;t but it was catchable -- -that&#039;s the ball game right there
-Giants punter had a great game--
-Did the Giants have to complete another one in a million pass? The throw and catch to Manningham against really good coverage couldn&#039;t be duplicated with a bushel of footballs-- but give them credit they made the play when it mattered --

REPLY - MPC - you&#039;re right whats the odd&#039;s of two one in a million catches - ugh. Punter was huge for them and zoltan choked]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[-Still can&#039;t believe people are putting a lot of this on Welker.  Brady turned him around and made him jump.  Yes, he usually catches those but throw a decent damn ball Brady.

-I felt the defense and the O-Line did their part and played better than expected.  

-17 points in past 2 SBs doesn&#039;t cut it for our front runner, pile up the stats against weak teams, QB.

REPLY - MPC - I agree more on Brady than Welker]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i HATED that vampire commercial.  why are vampires popular NOW?  i liked vampires as a kid in the late 80s and early 90s.  why is everyone else so late to the game?

as for the actual thing that mattered... the game.  welker needs to make that catch.  not brady&#039;s best throw, but he was toast after that sack by tuck, and for him to make a 92% throw there (which is what it was), his alleged GREAT receiver needs to come up with the remaining 108% and make the grab.  bottom line.

hernandez... great game early and mid... faded late.

at least they gave it their all this time... they still left plays out on the field, but it wasn&#039;t for lack of effort, which i remain convinced to this day was the reason for the 07 loss.  they played hard last night, just didn&#039;t make the plays they needed to.

i&#039;m officially tired of logan mankins&#039; act.

that play to branch with a minute left is a haunter, for sure.

BS safety call.  what&#039;s the difference between a QB having the ability to fire it 30 yards out of bounds to right or left, but not 30 yards away from all defenders and receivers???  rule change, hello.

1 catch for ocho.  thanks for playing.

agree with brian above on chung.  late to help, needed to be there earlier.  he did destroy nicks though and that made nicks a non-factor for a 10-minute stretch.  that guy came back to make like 3 tough grabs though.  crazy receivers on giants.

i&#039;m rambling..........

REPLY - MPC - Rambling is OK - Mankins allowed the pressure on the saftey, the sack that used up Pats last time out and the hit that hurt Brady / Can you imagine if Brady put that ball on Branch - biggest play in Super Bowl history]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Deion Branch is Brady&#039;s binkie but after diving to the carpet multiple times and not fighting for the ball on a couple others, he has to go. 

Welker has to make that catch--game over, worst case is field goal with less than 1 minute on clock, so Giants need touchdown to win with 1 timeout. 

Audi Vampire commercial and the &quot;popular girls diet&quot; commercial were pretty good.

REPLY - MPC - Branch hasn&#039;t been hit hard in ten years - Audi good - I think Brady deserves more blame than Welker]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Poor decision by Brady to throw that bomb to Gronkowski. The guy was playing on one ankle, he had no lift and zero chance to make a play on that pass. 

Welker should have made that catch but that wasn&#039;t the best throw by Brady. 

Agree on Branch, he might still be running. 

Chung was late helping on the Mannigham bomb. 

Sterling Moore is a player!

REPLY - MPC - Chung arrived on time the time before and the results were incomplete not that time / Sterling Moore Asante in the making / Brady had the game in his hands threw an interception and missed Welker]]></description>
