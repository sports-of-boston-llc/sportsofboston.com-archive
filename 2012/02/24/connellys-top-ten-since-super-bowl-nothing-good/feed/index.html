		<description><![CDATA[MPC, you&#039;re showing your age by not having Kurt Cobain on your list (died at 27 like Morrison, Joplin, Winehouse and Hendrix).

TRADE RONDO.  for anything.

braun got off on technicalities... it&#039;s not even related to the contents of his testing sample, it&#039;s related to the process by which the sample was collected... that&#039;s absurd.  what a shame.  at least MLB slammed the decision.

seguin is, at the least, skating hard and improving defensively.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No way Lin leaves as free agent. 

I say the Celtics will make the playoffs because the other teams in the East are weak. In other words, they&#039;ll make it by default. 

Mario Chalmers stuffed Lin last night in Miami. 

Is it time to finally deal Rondo? Enough of the talk of it Ainge, pull the trigger and get something good in return. 

Reggie Wayne would look good with the Patriots. 

Look out for Witchita State come March Madness. The Shockers might shock everyone!]]></description>
