		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d include the 1974 Celtics win over the Knicks(Bradley, Debusschere, Frazier, Reed, etc.) in the ECF to that list.  That great Knick team had bounced the C&#039;s from the playoffs the two previous seasons.  The C&#039;s 1973 team had won 68 regular seasons games, but playing with a hurt Havlicek, got crushed at home on Easter Sunday in Game 7.

REPLY - MPC - Havlicek shot lefty after that / I remember that Easter - I think the REd Sox gave up a grand slam with two outs in the ninth - Bruins lost too I think]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bruins need a defenseman and a forward, and quick. Wakeup call time.

Horton&#039;s &quot;mild&quot; concussion may have him out for a while. And Johnny Boychuk and McQuaid are fighting to see who is a worse 6th defenseman right now (and Corvo was a mistake, not a bad one, but a mistake). 

Timmay is very lucky they won Tuesday--2 of the 3 goals were quite soft.

REPLY - MPC - Time to move Thomas]]></description>
