		<description><![CDATA[They got to the 7th game of the finals with Garnett&#039;s bad knee.  How much of a problem could have it been?  Why did the knee cause the collapse?  Why then?  It is absurd to say that Garnett&#039;s injury had a part in not winning the championship.

At the start of last year Masterson would have been a 7th starter.  You do know that last year was his only good full year after his 2008 rookie season?  You do know that he is giving up 4.5/9ip this year?  You do know he is terrible against LHH?  Again, a year and a half of Victor Martinez and the draft picks for Masterson is a good trade.  Do you know who one of the picks was?  Matt Barnes.

Clay Buchholz, Daniel Bard, and Jacoby Ellsbury were all compensatory picks.  These picks are very valuable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not convinced there&#039;s no wrongdoing as far as 38 studios goes. When Gov. Chafee says there were no warning signs of their impending demise, and that they had been meeting all their benchmarks (not saying I believe Chaffee 100% on this, either), that makes me suspicious that the company had been showing RI officials fraudulent accounting info. 

We&#039;ll see; it make strictly be a case of really poor judgement on behalf of RI to invest that much in a risky venture, or a combo of bad judgement as well as shenanigans at 38 Studios.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[George, I can&#039;t say I always agree with you; and, at times, you start building an interesting insight or argument and then veer into some bizarre, infuriating or (more rarely) ill-informed direction.  Still,I am always delighted to find a new post by you on Bruce&#039;s indispensable site, and I always read and think about it before moving on to other links. In the end, we vote with our eyeballs, so I guess that means you ace the eyeball test. Thanks for the effort and for many mornings of food for thought.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[His knee dogged him all year.  Masterson would have been the #3 starter last year. Statistically he would have been their best pitcher. Do you remember the rotation in September? They had to bring in Eric Bedard&#039;s corpse just to stay in the race.  Masterson like Lowe will be pitching in this league late into his 30&#039;s.  Not a good haul for a year and half.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The claim that they chose Youk over Beltre is flat out wrong.  Yes, Masterson would have been a great seventh pitcher for the Sox last year.  A year and a half of an All-Star catcher is a good haul for Masterson.  

So Garnett&#039;s year old knee injury is what caused the Celtics to collapse in the seventh game of the finals?  That is absurd.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well Rick, if you watched the Celtics those years you would have seen it took KG a full two seasons to recover.  That was him dragging that leg through the 2010 playoffs especially the Lakers. OH A DRAFT PICK!  Oh as long as they got a damn draft pick. Masterson would have looked pretty good last season instead of Kylie Weiland. You see you don&#039;t need the draft pick if you don&#039;t trade away the young pitchers for a guy you don&#039;t want to re-sign. They have a 200 million payroll, you don&#039;t make moves hoping to pick up a draft pick that will help in 4 years. 2010 was the bridge year, the Red Sox spent to much time trying to be a little pregnant. Go to Soxprospects and see what the hit rate on draft picks is.  Try about 2 out of every 50.  Finally, they knew they could get A-Gon, they didn&#039;t want to sign Beltre long term, because they had Youk under contract at reasonable dollars.  Well they so far have been wrong on Beltre, wrong on A-Gon and wrong on Youkilis.  Rick, I think your rebuttals are poorly thought out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So do the Celts have playmakers or not?  How did Kevin Garnett&#039;s knee injury from a year before cause the Celtics collapse a year later?  Spending a minute worrying about Nick Hagadone is a minute too many.  Masterson for a year and a half of Martinez and a draft pick is worth it.  Theo did not choose Youk over Beltre.  He chose Gonzalez over Beltre.  Christ, this article is poorly though out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are correct about the 38 Studios thing--it&#039;s a tragedy for numbers of people and families. However, the &quot;glee&quot; from media and others is over Schilling&#039;s rants about the evils of big government and handouts, and then he, through his company, goes out and does exactly what he railed against. Then, when it falters, the person with an opinion on everything and everyone is mute. And the current RI governor was dead set against the loan, so don&#039;t blame him for this mess. 

I still thank Schilling for &#039;04 and &#039;07, though.]]></description>
