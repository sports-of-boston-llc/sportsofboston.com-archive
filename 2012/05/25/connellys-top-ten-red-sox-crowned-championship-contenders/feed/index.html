		<description><![CDATA[You aren&#039;t really a Celtics fan, are you?  You are relentlessly critical of all the stars of the Garnett era Celtics despite their many achievements, and you underrate them horribly.  Now you want them to lose?

I could live with all of that actually, but badmouthing Green Acres - that&#039;s beyond the pale!

REPLY - MPC - I think you are right and wrong on my Celtics fandom. I am cynical on the team. I think Rondo&#039;s Sunset Boulevard act is only going to get worse the more he is entrenched I think he is one punch of a ref from being out of the league. I would move him quick. Garnett like Clemens second 20K game could make people overpay. I admittedly have never been a Pierce fan. Ray Allen is on back nine and has to be hurting. So with that said they have done a lot better than I ever gave them credit for. Its going to be painful to see Lebron dunking and Miami crowd going wild - that series will be Miami in 5 /// On the other note Arnold the pig c&#039;mon he&#039;s no Spot from the Munsters]]></description>
