		<description><![CDATA[Interesting that Herman was wearing Bill Lee&#039;s number. Coincidence, I think not. 

Maybe Coach V could take to wearing sharkskin sportcoats on the field like Leo Durocher. It can&#039;t hurt. 

Beckett actually said &quot;we only get 18 days off&quot; all year. Does he count sitting on his a%% on 4 of 5 days as actually &quot;working&quot;? Where can I get tickets for the Beckett Bowl.

REPLY - MPC - Despite muscles Herman test came back negative as opposed to Lee / Beckett is a true American hero - what a warrior / Leo D. getting in the actors guild]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m feeling sorry for Valentine at this point!  The inmates are running the asylum.  When you watch Bobby cover up for Beckett and apologize to Youkilis, it is just sad.

REPLY - MPC - Its like watching Admiral Stockdale in the debates]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great opportunity for the Sox to make a statement right now.  Culture needs to change.  Who is the clubhouse leader on this team?  Beckett should have been waived in the middle of his post game press conference.  He clearly needs more days off because last I checked he pitches every fifth day with winters off and that is not enough for him. They may turn this around and win some games, but that is irrelevant as this may be the hardest team to like in the history of Boston sports.  Your Middlebrooks comments are interesting.  Is that his makeup or is he a victim of the environment? Unfortunately, the manager and ownership and GM are as hard to like as the players so not sure what the catalyst is to change.

MPC - Reply - Great point 340 days off for a diva pitcher with his Confederate beard-moustache. Henry proves making money has nothing to do with people skills or managment skills. There should be fights in the locker room. Lucchino should be called on carpet to report on his performance since Theo left. Gene Lamont is one lucky guy]]></description>
