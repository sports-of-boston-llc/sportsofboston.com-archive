		<description><![CDATA[Emmitt Smith transformed the epitome of toughness on national television in the last game of the season in 1993. With the Cowboys and Giants fighting for the NFC East and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, Emmitt played the entire game with a sprained and separated right shoulder. He ran 32 times for 168 yards and caught 10 balls for 61 yards. The Cowboys won the game, earned home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, and captured the Super Bowl title. When asked why he played through the pain, instead of watching from the sidelines, Smith calmly responded, “This is why they pay me.”

REPLY - MPC - That moment was in the top ten - he was so steady that he probably didn&#039;t get the LT, Sanders credit - plus he fought through the pain of Dancing With the Stars]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Like stevea, at the top of my list is not being able to watch Tony C in his prime.  Reggie Lewis and Daryle Stingly too.

REPLY - MPC - Good ones - Stingley and Stanley Morgan were becoming a great duo]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Would add to the cheated comment (on a lesser basis):

Norman Leville-He could have been a very special player

Reggie Lewis

Tony C

Cam Neely could have gone a few more years if it wasn&#039;t for Ulf

It looks like Marc Savard may be added here and I hope that Nathan Horton does not become part of this list.

REPLY - MPC - Cam Neely definitely he was the best power right wing ever and we lost a good five years of greatness]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tom Coughlin coached Boston College football for about as long as anybody does.  I &#039;m not sure I get your point.

REPLY - MPC - Coughlin like Lehay had the team on the verge of national prominence when he left (one minute away from Sugar Bowl) - if they offered him a $10mm annuity to stay 10 years maybe he would have felt invested]]></description>
