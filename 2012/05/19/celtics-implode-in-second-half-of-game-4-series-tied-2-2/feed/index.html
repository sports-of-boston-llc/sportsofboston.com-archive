		<description><![CDATA[Initially, I was very dissapointed with Lebron  tniakg his talents to South Beach .. Wade vs Lebron was a budding rivalry that i was getting used to enjoying.  The sense of accomplishment when you win a title with 3+ HOF&#039;ers is minimal.. Jordan slayed all his goliaths.. Detroit, NYK, Portland, LA..etc.. The Jordan titles were defined by marquee matchups vs the next  challenger(s) .. For example Magic, Clyde, Barkley, Kemp/Payton, and then Stockton/Malone(2X). Each of those years the teams Chicago beat were legit contenders, only to see MJ kick them off HIS mountain, with his TEAM. No big FA signings, (unless u count Rodman) no tag alongs looking for a ring. THAT&#039;s what makes Jordan the G.O.A.T  He took Pippen, HoGrant, BJ, and the rest of the role players and made them champions.Now, with todays NBA, we will see the same four teams year in and year out be true title contenders for the next 5-8years.. BORING, watered down NBA. Like everything else that is wrong with sports, blame the example set by the NY Yankees!!]]></description>
