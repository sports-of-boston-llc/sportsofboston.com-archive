		<description><![CDATA[Just_my_opinion -

As the Red Sox found out last year, just having a guy who can take the mound every fifth day and put up some good starts (and some bad ones) is valuable. Drabek is out for the season, but Morrow, who may be their best starter, is out for a few weeks with an injury known for lingering. That&#039;s a big blow.

The 4th place comment was half equal opportunity losing with Toronto and half thinking maybe there are enough positives for the Red Sox to stay afloat regardless, not just look to 2013.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re a real optimistic guy to definitively believe that the Red Sox are at least a 4th place team. 

It&#039;s also noteworthy that the Red Sox have not fared well against their division rivals; even the Blue Jays they have a 3-3 tie. Also, the starter that the Blue Jays lost was Drabek, who carried a 4.67 ERA; it really can&#039;t hurt the team to lose that guy.

I&#039;m not saying they can&#039;t finish 4th or better, but it&#039;s far too early to be certain of anything.

Unless you mean 4th place by default if they tie the Blue Jays for the basement of the AL East...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A change of scenery will do him wonders. There&#039;s a lot of bad blood in the air, and it just needs to get cleared out before he starts to contribute.

I hate when it happens, especially when it&#039;s a home-grown player, but it does and you have you move on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Youth must be served, always!  Especially in play-for-pay sports.

As for Youkilis, if he were an amateur &quot;loyalty&quot; to his team, and visa versa, would be an important factor but he is a professional, paid $12,500,000 in 2012, to play 3rd base/1st base in a fashion that belies his hefty salary.  If he will return half of his salary for his half hearted performance to date, I say, &quot;He stays&quot;.  If not, &quot;I say, &quot;He goes!&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is nuts to continue this lineup logjam in order to wedge a guy into it with the Mendoza Line neighborhood batting average of .215.  Youk is no longer starter worthy at the plate or in the field, and his durability is very tentative.  He&#039;s been a Sox stalwart, but it is time for him to go.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately, it sounds like Valentine wanted Youk gone before the season even started. If they can trade him to improve the team, it&#039;s the end of an era for sure. 

When Youkilis came up in 2004, while Bill Mueller was on the DL, he was even more impressive than Middlebrooks during his first 35 or so games. 

I&#039;m with you - I hope he has a big second half but, from the sounds of it, the front office is selling that second half to trade partners.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Youk deserves a pass for services rendered. The BoSox pretty much smell up any stadium they play in so why dump Youk. Is he the fall guy? The greatist have had slumps and injuries. C&#039;mom man!!! The guy could have an unbelieveable second half. We lost Veritek and now, Youk! Where&#039;s the loyalty.]]></description>
