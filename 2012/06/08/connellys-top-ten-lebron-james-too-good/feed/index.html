		<description><![CDATA[Y&#039;know, as you might guess from my cyber name, I do appreciate Tim T. No Cup without him, and his 2010-2011 year will go down as one of the great seasons in NHL history, and, of course, he was part of the finest team in UVM history. 
But not only did the White House stuff sandbag the Bruins, but insulted the taxpayers who helped his career. Tim was a scholarship athlete: He had his education and hockey equipment paid for by taxpayers, who helped further a career in which he earned many millions of dollars (although much to his credit he busted his butt to get there and earn them). He played in NHL arenas further subsidized by taxpayers. He flew on airlines to professional games on planes guided by federal employees to and from airports built by federal funds. To thumb his nose at taxpayers by refusing to go to the White House while ranting about &quot;Big Government&quot; and excess taxation was not only hypocritical, but insulting to those who helped pay his way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s an obvious caveat, but I hope all are well in Thomas&#039; family.  However, I agree with Curly that it&#039;s odd that Thomas preaches of the &quot;3-F&#039;s&quot; but also promotes his workout system.  

Thomas has had an axe to grind against the B&#039;s since they explored trading him in the 2010 Summer.  He came back with a mask that had no black &#038; gold, etc.  They begged him before hand to not pull the White House stunt, &#038; he did it anyway.  BTW, to show his contempt for B&#039;s management, Thomas did not personally tell Chiarelli of his decision to take a year off.  Instead, he had his agent do it.  Nice touch. 

Because of Thomas&#039; animosity towards the B&#039;s management, I&#039;m suspicious of his announced plan to take a year off.  I think he is trying to stick it to the Bruins &#038; limit where he can be traded after July 1.  

I think Thomas will be playing somewhere else next year, but the B&#039;s will get virtually nothing in return for him.  They&#039;ll be happy just to avoid the cap hit.  They&#039;ll go with Tuukka, who now has all the leverage in his contract talks (btw, Tuukka &#038; Thomas share the same agent).

Last Thomas comment: personally, I think it would have been nice if Thomas took the time &#038; space in his postings to thank his former Bruins teammates.  Stay classy, Tim-me-me-me.

REPLY - MPC - Question is did you appreciate Thomas?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Was wondering where the &quot;Trade Rondo&quot; comment was today?  MC are you ok, usually that is the lead.  Game 7 is &quot;grit and balls&quot; vs. &quot;eye of tiger&quot; legacy.  Kevin Bacon seemed to do OK after Animal House &quot;remain calm, all is well&quot;

REPLY - MPC - Excellent one Kevin Bacon / I still trade Rondo as soon as postseason over because I think his odd behavior will only get worse the bigger he gets - he is at his highest trade value (would you take Bynum for him?)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As fans, we&#039;re in Thomas&#039; debt. However, he&#039;s been a pretty big distraction since the beginning of last season, and he does take a holier than thou attitude to everybody. I found it ironic that he needs to get back to the &quot;3 Fs&quot; but still found time to hawk his business ventures in the same breath.

REPLY - MPC - I have always been a fan of Thomas but his White House episode was selfish - if you can move him I&#039;m fine with it as you have got a lot out of him]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been hating on the Sox pitching as much as anyone...but we may have to lay off Buchholz for a little while. His last three starts he&#039;s gone 24 innings, 18 hits, 4 runs, 19 k&#039;s, only 4 walks and a 1.50 ERA. Wednesday&#039;s game was 2:31. Did they forget they play in the AL? GREAT line on Sanchez and the proms....good to have you back!

REPLY - MPC - Fair point on pitching / are you kidding 2:31]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great line about Fance and Germany. 

I think that it was Joe Fitzgerald who wrote an article in the Herald that gave an interesting perspective on the Thomas sabbatical.  He did compare it to Cowens.  Aurbach was quoted in it.  He defended Cowens a bit.  For me, Thomas has earned the benefit of the doubt.  He&#039;s not a pampered, spoiled, petulant pro athlete.

REPLY - MPC - I&#039;m ;a huge Thomas fan as was a Cowens fan - they gave you everthing in this day and age thats a rarity]]></description>
