		<description><![CDATA[Coco is also hitting .207 this year, had an OBP of .316 in 572 plate appearances last year, and owns a second home on the DL. I also think he&#039;s a great guy, but pass. 
In 707 career at-bats, Moss is hitting .238 with an OBP of about .300 and a slugging percentage of about .400. Decent numbers for a middle infielder, maybe, not a corner outfielder.  
Reddick has a chance, though, to start for a mediocre team.

REPLY - MPC - Not saying that Crisp is Ricky Henderson but interesting that Red Sox are finding home in Oakland]]></description>
