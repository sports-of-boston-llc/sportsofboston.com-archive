		<description><![CDATA[The Red Sox outfield log jam will resolve itself, in time.  In fact, the outfield dilemma is a problem that most MLB managers would love to have.  

Of more concern is the starting pitching, which has been inconsistent, at best through the first 69 games.  A major shuffling of the starting rotation has to be made, sooner rather than later, in order to make a bonified charge for a playoff spot in the second half of the season.  

There isn&#039;t a starter among the lot who is performing as a #1 or #2 starter should.  Closest to that level is Felix Doubrant, who was considered questionable at the start of the season.  Buchholz has made progress but his ERA is still up in &quot;John Lackey land&quot; at around 6 rpg.  Beckett and Lester are big disappointments and one or both should be put on the trading block.  Perhaps shipping both, plus cash, to Seattle for King Felix might light a fire under the Sox rotation.  

Better yet, put both in the bullpen, and let guys like Morales, Miller and Aceves have a go at a starter&#039;s job.  They cannot do any worse that the collective B &#038; B performance to date.]]></description>
