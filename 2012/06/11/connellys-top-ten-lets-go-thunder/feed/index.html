		<description><![CDATA[Pierce was clearly hurting.

I can&#039;t think of any good reason to trade Rondo.  He is very good and still getting better, and he steps it up in the big games.

REPLY - MPC - You are probably in the majority on Rondo / Pierce is who he is -Game 7 vs Cleveland he proved me wrong most of the other games he proved me right]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[* Doc reminds me of K.C. Jones.  Struggles to develop/utilize the bench.
* Celtics bench (game 7); 2 pts, 4 reb (2 def), 1 ast, 1 stl, 8 personal fouls - YIKES!
* Would have brought in Hollins before Stiesma; better energy, quickness, movement.
* Maybe could have relegated Ray to a well timed sniper off the bench.
* Would have liked to have seen what Johnson and/or Williams could have provided on defense.  Plus an opportunity for some great experience.
* The only way I trade Rondo is for the number one pick (Anthony Davis).  Not for Chris Paul; injury prone(?), and strikes me as similar to Wade as a potential punk.  Not for Bynum; very injury prone and horrible attitude.
* Bring Garnett back, Let Ray go and trade Pierce, although it would pain me deeply not to see him retire a Celtic.
* I miss Perk and Tony Allen!

REPLY - MPC - PErk and Allen would have changed this team dramatically and would have won them the Conference / Doc did a good Job with Bradley / Hollins does bring energy no doubt]]></description>
