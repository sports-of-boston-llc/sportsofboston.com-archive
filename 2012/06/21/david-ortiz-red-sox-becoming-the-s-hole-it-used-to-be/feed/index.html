		<description><![CDATA[Peter - I appreciate the comment. It seemed that many of the media members did what they could to avoid Ortiz&#039;s criticism, acting like it wasn&#039;t directed at them, when it clearly was. 

Common sense tells me that Ortiz is looking to get all the attention on himself to take the load off of his teammates.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re the first person to report on this accurately...most of the media likes to take his comments out of context and say &quot;it&#039;s become the ****hole it used to be&quot; is a reference to Boston as a team, and not the media situation (which is what he was actually referring too).

Kudos for not burying your head in the sand and/or being a biased ratings-seeking buffoon.]]></description>
