		<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t agree with you more on Title 9.  I have 4 daughters and 5 sisters - all athletic, but I&#039;m done hearing about it.  The supporters of Title 9 are not willing to do the reasonable thing and carve out football from the compliance requirement.  Football is unique in its numbers and cannot be replicated for women&#039;s sports.  They also refuse to allow for the inclusion of cheerleading - which is featured on Yahoo sports today, in fact, as having more injuries than all other women&#039;s sports combined.  Those girls are essentially gymnasts who compete for National Championships as well.  Let them have scholarships and be counted.

There should be some articles about all the men&#039;s sports that have to be cut from colleges so that schools can comply with title 9 without killing football.  Look at any school with a football program&#039;s website and see the disparate list of women&#039;s sports and men&#039;s sports.  BC used to have good lacrosse and wrestling etc., but they&#039;re all gone now.   Schools have to cut way back on resources for men&#039;s sports to comply - then are forced to either kill the football program or concede that they aren&#039;t going to be very competetive.  BU and Northeastern are great local examples of Title 9 football casualties.    BU was a national semifinalist, then part of the NCAA Div 1AA playoff the following year, then gone 2 years later.

It&#039;s great to give an opportunity to women to compete, but be reasonable about it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Title 9 was a real game changer for women and sports. Today, we have a major electronics manufacturer,  (Panasonic) using the USA women&#039;s soccer team as a model for toughness.  I can&#039;t imagine that happening without Title 9. If you&#039;re not interested, then feel free to skip the stories. I think the stories are fascinating, and appreciate hearing more about women athletes.


REPLY - MPC - I&#039;m all for balanced allocation of resources but you would think its the anniversary of the English leaving Boston Harbor. SI did a full issue on it so didn&#039;t ESPN magazine, etc, etc]]></description>
