		<description><![CDATA[Pet Peeve - Media kissing players and teams butts or covering for players or owners they know are bad apples while on the team then blasting them when they leave town.

Manny Ramirez - as long as Manny was putting up huge numbers media remained quiet. Just Manny being Many!

Andrian Gonzalez - clubhouse lawyer. 

Jerry Sandusky - media knew in 1998 this guy was a pedophile but remained silent to protect the Penn State mystique.  

What other examples are there?
REPLY - MPC - Thats a good list - I remember being shocked when Nomar was a problem when alls you saw was smiles and good articles then he leaves and you find out he was difficult??]]></description>

REPLY - MPC - Slightly - I thought Flutie&#039;s year was magical that comes along once a generation ie. Ftorek, Yaz 67, etc- Brady was amazing but it was a 15% differntial to past years]]></description>
