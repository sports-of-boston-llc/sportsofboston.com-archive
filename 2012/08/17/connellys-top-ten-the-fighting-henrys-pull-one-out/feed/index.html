		<description><![CDATA[i dont think i could ever root for burress in any way shape or form.  glad they didn&#039;t sign him.

brady is ranked too low by nfl.com.  he&#039;s easily the #2 pick in most formats behind only aaron rodgers this year.  just my opinion!

that&#039;s a good ranking for welker.  WR is very deep this year, and about 5 QBs, 10 to 12 RBs and then a smattering of WRs / TEs should all go ahead of him.  don&#039;t forget, in years where he doesn&#039;t light it up TD-wise, his yardage totals only account for about 10 points per week.
