		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Mankins still recovering from being blown up in Super Bowl…&quot;

It&#039;s very difficult to play well with a torn ACL. Were you not aware of his injury or did you just want to take a shot at players who play through injuries? I believe you have railed against Jacoby Ellsbury for not playing while injured. Damned if you do and damned if you don&#039;t, I guess.

REPLY - MPC - I don&#039;t think your comment is unfair and I can certainly see the two edges fo the equation BUT with that said Mankins got absolutely blown up on every big play in the Super Bowl - his toughness was too much - should have went someone else]]></description>
