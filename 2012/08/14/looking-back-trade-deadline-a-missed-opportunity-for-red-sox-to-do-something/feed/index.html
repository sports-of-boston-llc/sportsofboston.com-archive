		<description><![CDATA[The owners are still making money!! Even though they are out of touch with reality. The thing that irritates me is the &quot;fan&quot; is the bad guy in the eyes of owners and players. We (the fans) ask too much of them...to try, to exert them selves, to cure the team problem.
Maybe we the &quot;fan&quot; should just walk away - shaking our heads?? Let them make money with no &quot;fans&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Their big mistake is they won&#039;t face reality.  They should have dealt off pieces to pick up prospects or to give looks to guys in the minors.  At least this would have helped dump payroll.  They have too many big money decision or contracts they are stuck with.  Crawford, Lackey and Elsbury are killers.  The one you may want to keep is the one that will be a free agent after 2013, in Elsbury.  The ownership and Luchino got too full of themselves after 2007.  They should either sell or wake the F up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[They have to dump salary to get below the 40% penalty tax threshold of $173M (salary is much more than $175M)which would also qualify them for megabucks from the CRA pool. They can&#039;t afford a #1 or #2 pitcher. They can&#039;t afford Ellsbury when he becomes a FA.  The Yankees would also like to get below the tax threshold.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ben C. has his hands cuffed.There is many changes he needs to make. Starting with getting his own Manager. One he picks. He dose need to dump Beckett and many others. 
 It would be a good move to let Nick P. &#038; C. Ross go to contenders and take back A ball players who may pan out in 3 years or so. Bring up SS J. Iglesias and J.C. Linares there hot right now and good players. Time to find out if thay have the skills to fit in. let not wait till next spring and fall short again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Red Sox are carrying a $175M payroll in 2012.  They have played a majority of the season with 1/3rd to 1/2 of that payroll on the DL.  50% of the starting staff have been awful but the real problems lay in the GM&#039;s office and a trade or two won&#039;t solve that problem.

They may be able to dump 10-15% of that total of $175M after this season but doing so means walking away from David Ortiz&#039;s contract.  Tough decision, as David is still he #1 guy in the AL and could be for 3-4 more years if he works at being healthy and stays in shape.

So they dump salary, what then?  There are no legitimate aces out there to be &quot;bought&quot; with a six figure long term contract. The team has enough of those. The Sox are going to have to grow their own or resurrect what they thought were aces in Beckett and Lester.  

What troubles most of us is the constant injuries, some of which appear very minor to keep &quot;in condition&quot; players on the DL for weeks and months at a time.  If I were John Henry I would be talking to experts at Harvard Med or Tufts or BU to see what the team can do, medically speaking, to cut  the loss of so many players to the DL.   Either they ate training incorrectly or there is fakery going on. What do you think?]]></description>
