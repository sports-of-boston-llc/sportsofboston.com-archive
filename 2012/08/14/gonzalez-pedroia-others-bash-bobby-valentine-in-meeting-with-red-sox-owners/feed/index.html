		<description><![CDATA[Cherington is the source of all the front office chicanery.  He has to be replaced.  Once he was told he could not hire an inexperienced, uneducated &quot;yes&quot; man to be his manager, at the start of the season he has become a power seeking, back stabbing, fomenter of dissatisfaction, among the players, because the field boss senior management chose, over his objections, is a smarter and more experienced baseball man than Cherington, could ever be.  He simply does not have the resume for the job.  But Henry will not replace his GM (after all Ben has worked for the Red Sox for a decade)  during the season nor without finding a spot for him somewhere else.  Maybe in Chicago, with the Theo and the Cubs?]]></description>
