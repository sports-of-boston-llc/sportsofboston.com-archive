		<description><![CDATA[I would have said the two draftees on the roster were Avery Bradley and Rajon Rondo.

Craig Nettles and Joe Gordon were both excellent ballplayers, players whose Batting avgs understate their value significantly.  Both had power, defense, high OBPs, clutch ability. Give me nine like those two guys and I will win 120 games every year.

REPLY - MPC - I played with the letter of the law on Rondo - you caught me / Nettles was better than his average and Gordon I don&#039;t like because of his fraud MVP over Williams]]></description>
