		<description><![CDATA[On the point of 100 yard rushers and receivers in the same game:

I&#039;m pretty sure CBS said it&#039;s only happened a couple times EVER. Should check on that though.

REPLY - MPC - I could see that being the case]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Poulter single-handedly won the whole thing. And on I think 15 he didn&#039;t concede a 2 foot putt when Simpson missed a 20 footer for birdie and the crowd started booing, his response was just great--it&#039;s the Ryder Cup, man. Rory had to be in some other hotel than the team hotel, there is NO way that his caddie and 15-20 other people would have let him be late if they knew where he was.

REPLY - MPC - I agree on Poulter / I agree on he wasn&#039;t in his hotel room]]></description>
