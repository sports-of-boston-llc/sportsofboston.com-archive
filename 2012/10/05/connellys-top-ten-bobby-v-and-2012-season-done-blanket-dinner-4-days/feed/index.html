		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Who’s the idiots? Werner, Henry and Larry might look the part, but the Sox had 3,043,003 in attendance in 2012&quot;.

The real idiots are those who receive their Season Ticket applications and re-up for another &quot;bridge year&quot;. 80 Wins tops in 2013.

REPLY - MPC - I bet one of their most profitable years of their decade]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gramatica injury an all-time laugher.  Those silly Gramaticas.

One can only hope that the Sox pay with horrid attendance next year... but you know... not likely.

REPLY - MPC - They are silly / pink hats probably lining up right now

See you at Blanket Dinner!]]></description>
