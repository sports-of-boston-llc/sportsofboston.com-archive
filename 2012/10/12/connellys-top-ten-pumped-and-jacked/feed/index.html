		<description><![CDATA[Morris Buttermaker as #1 coach.  Had horribly dysfunctional team, found sponsorship for team, drilled fundmentals, recruited top pitching and hitting, gave uplifting speeches, team had desire in the end and a huge winning streak they invented &quot;Cowboy up&quot;.  On Werth jumping around it was pure from the heart, who cares what he makes he wants to win]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As usual great stuff.

Agree on the Slauson hit. If receivers get protected by the NFL for being a &quot;defenseless receiver&quot; then lineman should be protected in a similar fashion. 

Love Boardwalk Empire. Huge Buscemi fan. New character Gyp is classic. 

I&#039;m an olive oil and bread guy but wife agrees with you.

REPLY - MPC - Buschemi on fire / need Boardwalk Empire to gain some momentum slow start - thats what makes marriages work more olive oil for you]]></description>
