		<description><![CDATA[*The 2-words most commonly yelled at TVs throughout New England yesterday: &quot;Turn Around!&quot;
* Matthew Slater hurt his leg/knee/ankle celebrating a punt coverage tackle.

REPLY - MPC - Yes on what was yelled / and you are right he did hurt himself doing his show!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You know the distinctive defensive units in the NFL sometimes get their own nicknames, like &quot;The Steel Curtain&quot; or &quot;The Fearsome Foursome.&quot;  What are we going to call this secondary?  &quot;The Bomb Squad&quot;?  &quot;Plugged Nickel&quot;?  &quot;Tostitos&quot;?

		<description><![CDATA[-Boston Globe runs two polls early on (a) will the Patriots go undefeated? and (b) is the offense better than 2007? What team are they watching?

-Let&#039;s face it. The Patriots are in decline and Brady cannot even deliver a first down when it matters, let alone a FG or TD. He has become a front runner QB. Great when things are going well but he cannot change the course of a game when adjustments and momentum change.  

-You are right about Welker.  He is the offense, everyone else is getting scraps and he is tough as nails.  Woodhead stepped up too. Small guys with big hearts! 

-Coaching stinks right now. Belichick and/or McDaniels seem way off.  Clock management issues 2 games in a row, forgo the running game from the get go, defense remains in cover 2 sitting way back and still gets beat deep.  If we are going to get beat deep anyway why not stunt, blitz, etc. to try to get the front seven to use their athleticism?

REPLY - MPC - I bet you could see a significant improvement in winning % over the last five years when the Patriots blitz at least 15 times / stubborn to a system to bend not break has cost the Patriots huge games - and almost cost them the Carolina Super  Bowl]]></description>
