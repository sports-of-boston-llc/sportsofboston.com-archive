		<description><![CDATA[Gas prices were actually $1.86 the day Obama was sworn into office.  That was a huge story during the Bush Years that gas was too high. Not a peep from the same people now.
You were right about O&#039;Brien coaching his way into the conversation about coach of the year.  I wonder if he will get many votes because it&#039;s still Penn State.  They missed an easy field goal at VA - they should have only one loss.  The opener was understandable because it was the first time they stepped on the field together since sanctions and losing key players.
Sorry that I can&#039;t be at the Blanket Fund dinner - Great event evry year.  Good luck.

REPLY - MPC - In some ways the early losess help O&#039;Brien if winning looked easy for him they would have given Paterno&#039;s group credit / Thanks for shout out on Blanket Fund - and your first rate support through the years!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One underappreciated Red Sox management blunder was passing on Adrian Beltre at $16mm per year.  Instead they traded the entire farm system for the right to pay Adrian Gonzales $22mm a year forever, forcing Youk to move to third.  Youk was never the same, and he&#039;s gone.  AGon was a mild dissappointment, and he is gone.  The prospects are gone.  And Adrian Belre, who is a better ballplayer than either Youk or AGon, will probably finish third in the MVP voting.  Ouch!

REPLY - MPC - Great point - bird in the hand right?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Worst Patriots play of the game, and I knew it would be bad because it was so unnecessary - 4th down and Brady goes for it... and fumbles. You could hear the entire neighborhood yelling at their TVs even before the snap.

REPLY - MPC - playing with fire - lucky it worked out. That was probably me you heard yelling]]></description>
