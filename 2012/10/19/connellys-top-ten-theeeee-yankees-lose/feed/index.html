		<description><![CDATA[You are joking about Meterparel?  A few examples of the midget moron: His junior high school girl giggle talking about Brandon McCarthy the day after he got the line drive off his head. (Real funny stuff). His constant shilling for BC and that other midget moron, Gene DeFilippo.  (At the start of the 4th footbal game this year Meterparel was claiming the team deserved to be 3-1 not 1-3).  His nauseating groveling to Larry Luchino to get a play by play job or the PA job.  Meterparel belongs under  a bridge harassing people who walk above.  A creep&#039;s creep.  Disgusting.

REPLY - MPC - Some of your points valid but overall we disagree on his value to sports radio]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Vince Vaugn and even worse Ben Stiller??? But yet no Richard Pryor, one of the best comics of all time? And I know you can&#039;t stand Eddie Murphy&#039;s movies, but have you not seen Eddie Murphy Raw?? And I know i&#039;m going Old School on this one..but how about Jackie Gleason, Steve Martin, or George Carlin?

REPLY - MPC - I was sort of leaning toward movie actors vs. stand up - Jackie Gleason deserves mention and Robin Williams deserves to be in there. Vince Vaughn is comic genius]]></description>
