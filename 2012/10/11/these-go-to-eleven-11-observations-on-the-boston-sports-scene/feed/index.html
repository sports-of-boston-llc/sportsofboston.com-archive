		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t understand why Welker doesn&#039;t get the respect he deserves.  Since coming to the Pats he does anything  asked of him  While maybe not the premier receiver like a Calvin Johnson, Welker is the perfect team and puts team before stats yet his stats deserve a new contract]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There were questions about Matthews growth his senior year.  But that is everyone in the league.  Its not just they didn&#039;t get Matthews, they ended up with Chung who we are now realizing is part of the problem in the secondary.  His coverage is awful and has not got better.  You either put together a pass rush or you put together a secondary.  They just started this last draft with the pass rush.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can buy nobody new Brady would be Brady. But nobody knew Gronk would be Gronk but everybody knew &quot;Matthews was a legit stud&quot;? BS.

If Matthews was such a sure thing, why was he picked 26th overall? He was also the 11th defensive player and 3rd linebacker taken. The Packers also took another defensive player (Raji) before they took him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s complete spin by Pats fans and media.  If the Pats really wanted Gronk they could have got that 2nd round pick somewhere.  OR they had two second round picks. They took Spikes and Cunningham.  They could have traded both or one and a 3rd and moved up to take Gronk.  Who by the way, was injured his senior year which is why he was available. They didn&#039;t know Gronk was going to be Gronk or Brady was going to be Brady.  But Clay Matthews was a legit stud, (enhanced or not) and the Pats needed a pass rusher. Don&#039;t believe the spin.  Listen its ok to admit that the Pats keep missing on defensive draft picks. True story.   Tom Dmitroff asked Belichick during the 2010 draft if he would move up for Julio Jones.  Belichick said no.  Stay put draft Jonathan Baldwin.  Atlanta gave up the currency and got a GREAT player.  Jonathan Baldwin is just a guy. We can&#039;t applaud Bill when they move up and not condemn when they move down and that&#039;s the problem.  That Gronk story is Football Life NFL network material.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s been well documented that the Clay Matthews trade led to the Gronkowski pick.  Would you really trade the straight up?  Matthews is having a great year, but he looked pretty pedestrian last year.

As far as Welker- despite your &quot;I&#039;m the most tortured Pats fan in the world&quot; hand-wringing, you&#039;ll be upset if Welker starts and has a typical Welker game sunday and the Pats win.  Your precious storyline will be subverted, and that seems to be what&#039;s most important to you as a fan.  I&#039;m sure your mea culpas will flood the twiteer feeds of all of the writers you stalk if this comes to pass.]]></description>
