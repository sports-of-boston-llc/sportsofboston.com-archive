		<description><![CDATA[C Napoli/Salty
1b Kendrys Morales
2b Pedrioa
SS Aviles/Stephen Drew
3b Middlebrooks
LF Cody Ross
CF Ellsbury
RF Alex Gordon
DH David Ortiz

SP Lester
SP Buchholz
SP Buerhle (Miami would trade him)
SP Peavy/Lohse/Haren/Shields (pending options)
SP Lackey/Dubront

CL Bailey
SU Tazawa/Aceves/Atchison
RP Hill/Miller/Bard/Mortenson

That&#039;s my ideal roster. You would have to trade for Buerhle, Gordon, and Morales but that price shouldn&#039;t be exorbant. My free agent money goes to Napoli, one SP, and Drew (capable shortstop - has an option in Oakland)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like Swisher, but not at Werth Years and Dollars.

My FA money is on Napoli.


How about this too: Ellsbury and Bard to Philly for Cliff Lee!

The centerpiece is salary relief for Philly.  Plus they need a rental CF til 2014 and a set-up man for Paps.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Swisher&#039;s career numbers at Fenway aren&#039;t bad. He&#039;d be worth a five year investment. Have him play first base for two years. Then have him be the primary DH and spot an occasional game at 1B or OF after Ortiz retires. He won&#039;t get a Jayson-Werth like deal, but JD Drew money seems reasonable. He&#039;d be worth it.

He&#039;s an OBP guy. Something LaRoche is not and it was an unsung killer to this offense this season.

SIGN SWISH and TRADE FOR ALEX GORDON!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree, great article. Everyone is a speculator. How about this?
Ervin Santana, Mark Trumbo, (or Kendrys Morales) Dan Haren, and Toril Hunter for John Lackey, either Buchholz or Jon Lester, and an outfielder of their choice-Cody Ross, Ryan Sweeney, Daniel Nava and possibly Jose Iglesias.
Next trade with the Dbacks for Trevor Cahill and Justin Upton or Chris Young for eithe Buchholz or Lester, probably Will Middlebrooks, and a player to be named later.  
Three new pitchers in the fold..
Third trade-Ellsbury for a young pitcher-Derek Holland or someone similar. That would give them four. 
I think with their injury history, a six man rotation is something to consider.
The Dbacks could use a catcher and either Lavernway or Salty should go for a frontline pitcher.
I would use the free agent market to try and sign Mike Napoli, a short term contract, and to pick up a third baseman in case Middlebrooks is traded. The flaw in the above scheme is what to do on Els, Iglesias, and catching. I think Ellsbury would work in a trade for a pitcher or a shortstop. I don&#039;t think Iglesias is ever going to hit his weight. 
Free agen signings besides infield, should address a reliever like Rafael Soriano, or Jose Valverde. They need a front liner.  Also make plans to replace Ellsbury.
I think that that would go a long way to help their cause.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ohhh the Red Sox have 5 problems. 


#1 solution: free agents
#2 solution: high profile trades 


Work with that approach and the team will never improve. This goes especially true at 1B because it is easily the most overpaid position in all of baseball. 


There are so many low profile signings and trades that can pay huge dividends. Why not explore that area?


Sample Solutions:
- CJ Cron is very likely blocked by Albert Pujols 

- Astros don&#039;t need both Wallace AND Singleton 

- Darin Ruf is very expendable to the Phillies

- Adam Lind is expendable; could revive himself in Boston

- Bourjos or Trumbo are expendable because the OF is already full

- Blue Jays don&#039;t need both Arencibia and D&#039;arnaud


This is where the value is found. Low cost options with HUGE upside. Worst case scenario, these guys are simply role players. Best case scenario and you could be looking at silver sluggers. 


A gamble? 
Perhaps. But it is immensely better than simply picking the top free agents. Even a child can do that.]]></description>
