		<description><![CDATA[To kraftownzrevs:

Argument 1:
Bruins avg attendance: 2008: 17,040, 2009: 17,173 capacity: 17,565 (near sellout every game)
Revolutions avg attendance: 2009: 12,427 capacity: 68,756 (not even close)

Sure it doesn&#039;t exactly show what&#039;s more popular, but if more people are attending Bruins games I&#039;ll be set arguing that the Bruins are more popular in Boston. For the rest of America, there&#039;s more of an argument.  The Seattle Sounders averaged over 31 thousand, which is very impressive and more then the best NHL team.  Still, this past Stanley Cup was watched by over four million people per night, with seven and a half million watching game seven.  So far the only thing I can find for the MLS  Cup 2009 was that it had a .5 TV share, which didn&#039;t qualify it for a top 20 spot for Nov. 22nd.

also, the Revolution do have a section on the website, but there is more attention paid to Red Sox, Patriots, Celtics and Bruins instead.  Articles tend to come from demand and those four sports are the most demand.  I hope that will change when the World Cup comes around.

Argument 2:
&quot;Does anyone care about soccer?&quot; Have I been outside the USA?

I understand that there are soccer fans outside of America, I live next door to a guy from Liverpool, but this article is intended for American readers.  I am sure many people who are not fans of soccer know its popularity outside the country, I was just trying to make an obvious statement, if I failed then I&#039;m sorry.  A good sign is that the coverage of soccer in the United States greatly grew with the USA&#039;s success in the 2002 World Cup, hopefully that continues should the States makes a run next year in South Africa.  Then Soccer&#039;s popularity will increase in the States and &quot;more people will care!&quot;


Thank you for criticizing my article.  I am happy to know people are reading and arguing any points I make.  I try to use as many facts as possible and sometimes they don&#039;t get linked to the article, my bad.  I&#039;ll keep up on those in the future.  I respect your opinions and hope you continue to read any future soccer articles I write.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@kraftownzrevs: Surprisingly people do care about soccer, in the US! Read the context, jerk.

Also, do you really think the Revs are AHEAD of the Bruins in popularity? I&#039;m as much of a defender of the Revs as any, but you&#039;re so wrong. 

Think of it this way: The Bruins have been around since 1925 and are one of the Original Six NHL teams. The Revolution have been around since 1996, and so has the MLS. The Bruins won five Stanley Cups before the Revs won a game.

Sure the NHL has their money problems (with the lockout, rough economy, etc), but of the 15 MLS teams in 2008, only THREE were profitable (LA Galaxy, Toronto, Dallas). 

So, in conclusion, the Bruins are obviously more popular than the Revolution (though I will admit the MLS is growing), and you are an ignorant jerk.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Behind the Red Sox, Patriots, Celtics and Bruins, it’s hard for the Revolution to get noticed and draw attendance. So, does it really matter to New Englanders that the Revolution are looking for a new soccer-specific stadium? It should.&quot;

Really, it should? then why do the Revs not get a category here? PS: What proof do you have that the Revs are behind the Bruins in popularity? 

&quot;Does anyone care about soccer?
Surprisingly, people do.&quot;

Surprisingly? Have you ever been outside the US?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s true... I was more playing off a personal experience.  I was at the MLS Cup in 1999, between United and Galaxy.  It says that near 45,000 people were there, but if you attended the game, it seemed that all the upper portions of the old Foxboro Stadium were sectioned off.  Like they sold more tickets then people actually going to the game.  Perhaps so to the Revs being in the 2002 game, more people decided to attend?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great article, but... &quot;Even during the MLS Cup games held at the old Foxboro, the stadium was only half-full at best. &quot;

Half-full?
Maybe the first one in 1996, but the last one in 2002 had 61,316 people at it.
