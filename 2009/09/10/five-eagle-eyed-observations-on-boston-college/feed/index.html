		<description><![CDATA[Carl, I think you&#039;re right on with the observations. After today&#039;s Kent State game, it only reinforces all your points. Marscovetra should have redshirted, he&#039;s definitely an afterthought in the rotation. Larmond is awesome, he bailed out Tuggle on that overthrown (slightly) pass for the touchdown. Kuechly had another good game as did LaGrande.]]></description>
