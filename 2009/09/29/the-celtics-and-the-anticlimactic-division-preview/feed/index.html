		<description><![CDATA[DBro, thanks for sharing your thoughts. I hope there is some good Cs-Raps scuffles this year too. Its been 3 or 4 years since we&#039;ve had a good Atlantic Division rivalry. I&#039;m pumped to watch some Toronto games this year, they are going to be a fun and frustrating team to watch I&#039;m sure.

Alex, I said that a little tongue in cheek, though I do think Rondo, Sheed, House and Daniels could carry the C&#039;s to finish in the top 3 in the atlantic. I mean come on, it is the Atlantic division were talking about]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice assessment of the &#039;Anticlimactic&#039; Division, Nathan.

Up here in T.O., everyone is pretty jacked about the upcoming season now that Bryan Colangelo has run out of players to trade. As you stated, I have no idea at all how the Raps will do this year -- on paper, this looks to be a decent squad, but they may take some time to come together as a unit with all of the new faces -- and they have a tough, tough schedule early on, so look for them to get off to a slow start, then really turn things on as the season goes on.

The Celts should wrap up the division early, but I hope the Raps can at least challenge them a bit -- not just as a Raptor fan, but just so we start to build up some interest within the division. I think Miller&#039;s departure will really hurt the Sixers, who could possibly drop below NJ if the Nets start to come together. I really like the young nucleus they&#039;re putting together and I agree that they may be Bron Bron&#039;s best bet if he&#039;s looking to get into the NYC market (I still think the big 3 free agents will all remain with their current teams, however).

Re: the Raps&#039; rebounding -- obviously this will still be a bit of an issue, but you may be forgetting about the fact they acquired Reggie Evans from Philly -- he&#039;s a beast on the glass and has apparently been working (sparring) with Bargnani, so we&#039;re hoping the big Italian picks up some of that gangsta attitude through osmosis.

If the Raptors figure things out and start to come together, then look out. I&#039;m not trying to give BC too much love, but he has assembled quite the diverse unit capable of playing many different styles and offense shouldn&#039;t be a problem. This roster could pose matchup problems galore for many teams and that&#039;s what has people here excited. With dynamite shooters like Calderon/Bargs/Bosh and Turk on the floor at the same time, look for Jose and Hedo to just pick &#039;n roll teams to death with B &#038; B. 

The Jack signing was soooo underrated as well -- finally a great backup PG who can also slide over to the two, has some toughness and can score. Where things could get scary is if they get anything at all out of Bellinelli/Amir Johnson. These guys are talented but haven&#039;t been in the right situation yet -- if they figure out a role with this team, they could have an absolutely dynamite rotation. Could. Again, defense will be an issue which will hamper them, which is why no one has any idea what to expect.

Re: a &#039;run and gun&#039; offense -- um, not so much with Calderon as the floor general. He plays at a very slow pace, so I&#039;m not sure where this &#039;high octane&#039; stuff is coming from... Coach Triano definitely put an emphasis on scoring more in transition toward the end of last year, which worked well especially with Marion in the fold, but Jose is definitely a half-court PG. Again, this team is going to pick &#039;n roll you to death with two guys who can run it marvelously and a ton of deadly shooters.

Anyways, nice recap again -- let&#039;s get this season started already!!! I&#039;m hoping for some heated C&#039;s/Raps action and maybe we&#039;ll actually be able to take one from you guys this year!

Good luck.]]></description>
