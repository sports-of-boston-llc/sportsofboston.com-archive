		<description><![CDATA[Thanks KC. I remember when some of the officials got in trouble with the IRS for dodging taxes.  I think they were suspended for a season or more.  I know one of them was Joe Forte, who is currently still officiating.  Back in 1969, I taught history at the same school where he was a phys ed instructor.  We earned $4,400 for the entire school year. It would be interesting to know what guys like him are making.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ken - I just checked online for that information. According to a CNBC article in 2007 (link: http://www.cnbc.com/id/19876494), NBA officials made $100,000 - $300,000 per year. 

I would imagine that the salaries increase (or are higher) based on a couple of things:
- If the referee is evaluated as good and fair, he&#039;ll probably be officiating more playoff games, and thus making more money
- If you&#039;re a good official and haven&#039;t been fired/disciplined in the past, I would imagine your salary increases with seniority]]></description>
