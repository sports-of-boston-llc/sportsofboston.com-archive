		<description><![CDATA[The title may be a little misleading, but I am not blaming the defense&#039;s entire performance for losing this game. I was pointing out three key plays or drives where the Patriots could have easily won this game. Obviously in a 7 point loss you can point the finger at any play in the game that could have changed the outcome, but given the circumstances, I think the Pats offense moved the ball well, but killed themselves with penalties and while the defense played well, they didn&#039;t force Matt Sanchez into any mistakes and let up some key first downs late in the game.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I disagree with your thought that the offense did enough to win.  In my opinion, it was the defense that did enough to win, especially with the loss of Mayo.  They were able to contain Thomas Jones and Leon Washington, which surprised me considering we lost Seymour and Mayo.  And they held Cotchery to only ONE crazy catch and run.  Sure they gave up their fair share of 3rd and longs, that should not go unnoticed; but overall, the New England Patriots should have won a game where they only let up 16 points.  

While the lack of offensive production can somewhat be attributed to the loss of Welker, it should be noted that Brady has done a lot with a little before.  This should have been no exception, even with the injury.  

The penalties accumulated on offense were the main reason for the loss; and therefore why I think the offense was the main reason for the loss - after all the OL is part of the offense.  Oh, and the special teams sucked.]]></description>
