		<description><![CDATA[First, after sleeping on it and analyzing all the facts...and reading a few articles on ESPN, A-Rod either unearthed a new drug called &quot;boli&quot; or completely lied. If all he took was an energy booster, then how did he test for elevated levels of testocerone? Was he horny or something when he was tested? I have to stick to my gut feeling that 95% of athletes lie to reporters for a variety of reasons at certain points. He shouldnt have lied, couldnt have lied...but I think he might have.

OK, second, Ortiz would have to be a total idiot to say what he said, knowing he took roids in the past. Again, Rafael Palmeiro did the same thing, and was caught later for it. I firmly believe that anyone associated with HGH will eventually get caught...so if that&#039;s what Papi&#039;s taking and he assumes he wont get caught, then he&#039;s a moron.

Third...If I were a hall of fame voter, i&#039;d have very simple critera when it comes to the Hall of Fame and steroids. I STRONGLY believe the careers of Rafael Palmeiro and Sammy Sosa at the very least were manufactured in large part by steroids, so I would never put them on my ballot. Mark McGwire for the most part as well would not appear on my ballot (I&#039;d argue that his only good numbers are the HRs created by roids and the walks he had because of pitchers fearing him).

If it&#039;s true that Roger Clemens began taking roids with the Blue Jays when he went from the &quot;twilight of his career&quot; as Dan Duquette said to one of the best two seasons for a pitcher in league history, then I can take most of what he did after that and throw it out. I strongly believe that Roger Clemens, Barry Bonds, and Alex Rodriguez are all hall of fame players without the steroids. As a result, I would put them on my ballot...eventually. They all might appear on my ballout in their fifth year of eligibility. 

Anyway...I&#039;m going to write up what I would do if I were a hall of fame voter...to come Thursday.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We also have to remember that Ortiz said that players caught NOW using should be suspended, not players caught in the past, so he could have used.

Gammons brought up a good point today in his article, he said if players are so adamant about showing how they were clean when everyone else was dirty than make all your drug tests taken throughout your career public. Plus if it did mean so much to them then they should have said something when it was going on ala Rick Heiling who no one listened to because he got knocked around by steroiders which perhaps knocked him out of the league.

Also, WE CAN&#039;T BE NAIVE into thinking that baseball was EVER clean. In the 20&#039;s and 30&#039;s, players scuffed the ball, stole signs, gambled on games they played in, in the &#039;40s, &#039;50s, and &#039;60s players talked about &quot;red juice&quot; and &quot;diet pills&quot; being passed around. In the &#039;70&#039;s and &#039;80s mike schmidt admitted that pretty much everyone was amphetimines of some sort. 

Unless you failed a test or were caught WHILE you were playing then you broke a rule and should be punished ala Palmeiro who isn&#039;t touching the hall of fame. 

Bonds, McGwire, Arod, Sosa: I&#039;m not huge fans of any of them, but they didn&#039;t break any rules because there was no system in place for them to break it. 

The one who SHOULD get the blame and the one who went as far as to say that he SHOULDN&#039;T get ANY blame is Bud Selig. He didn&#039;t stop this until the US Gov&#039;t demanded that he actually got off his ass and did something.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[He&#039;s full of crap.

I am a firm beleiver that he took steroids during other seasons besides the 2001-2003 years. 

He&#039;s not Rafael Palmeiro 2.0 because Palmeiro flat out denied any use of steroids at any time. A-Rod is at least admitting use of performance enhancing drugs, but I think he is lying whe he said his use of them was limited to that span of three seasons.

The whole excuse by players of &quot;I didn&#039;t know I was taking steroids&quot; is getting old mostly because it is bulls**t. A-Rod is going to have us beleive that he couldn&#039;t get energy boosters in the U.S.? Clearly he was naive to think that this special energy booster, which was only available in the Dominican Reoublic, was not some sort of illegal substance. If he is that stupid, then God help us.

Obviously we can&#039;t officially take away records or stats during &quot;tainted&quot; seasons. What can happen is that A-Rod can be kept out of the Hall for his actions much like Mark McGwire.

Beleive it or not, Ortiz is to me is questionable. I think that coming flat out and reprimanding A-Rod is his way of taking heat off of him (not that there was in the first place). I think he is trying too hard to make it clear to the public that he is clean and that is why I think he is up to something fishy.

As for the HR records themselves, I am still standing by what I have been saying for years:

Single Season Record: Roger Maris, 61.

All Time Record: Hank Aaron, 755.]]></description>
