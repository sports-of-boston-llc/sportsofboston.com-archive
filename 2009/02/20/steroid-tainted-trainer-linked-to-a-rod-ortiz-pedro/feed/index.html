		<description><![CDATA[after Pedro has adamantly claimed that he&#039;s &quot;dominated the steroid era,&quot; this will also make him a liar. i&#039;ve never been one to trust Pedro. the last few years have told us that where there&#039;s smoke, there&#039;s fire. they are now guilty by association, and it&#039;s not exactly a stretch of the mind.

many of the great Dominicans will now be tainted b/c of Tejada, Pedro, Beltre, etc....you have to wonder about Andruw...

I know the Dominicans were extremely poor, but the future opinion will be that they cheated the system to make millions, whether it be that they lied about their age or took roids...anything to gain an advantage...which i dont blame them for based on where they came from...but they&#039;re still tainted.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Now now, it&#039;s not a guarantee that Ortiz did steroids. But...this news is extremely disheartening.

Again...to me, everyone is guilty until proven innocent. I say they should release the 103 other names that tested positive in 2003. That&#039;s the only way this controversy and witch hunt might come to a close.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If I may quote myself from February 17th:

&quot;Beleive it or not, Ortiz is to me is questionable. I think that coming flat out and reprimanding A-Rod is his way of taking heat off of him (not that there was in the first place). I think he is trying too hard to make it clear to the public that he is clean and that is why I think he is up to something fishy.&quot;

I friggin&#039; knew it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK, we have to set a fair standard here.  If this &quot;further indicts&quot; A-Rod, then we have to admit to ourselves that it &quot;further indicts&quot; Ortiz as well. 

Lets be real.  David Ortiz did steroids. Looking at his stats, you can almost see the minute he started using (I would guess around July 2002, at which point he was batting in the 230s with 3 homeruns, when he finished with 20 homeruns and a 270 average. Traded to Boston the next year, and we know what happens next.).

Now I don&#039;t blame him - instead of being a mediocre player, he gets to be a legend, and he may never have to be a proven user. I bet that he would do it all over again. But he definitely was a user. 

So lets just set a fair standard.  If you want to crucify a-rod over this, you need to do the same to Ortiz, unless A-Rod&#039;s only crime was getting caught. 

Personally, I think it was the era, they both did what they did, and lets just make sure it ends now.]]></description>
