		<description><![CDATA[Morneau is younger and him and Mauer can do some serious damage.

Berkman is getting older and he really, really collpased in the 2nd half last season where he hit .259 after the break with only 7 HR. This included a memorable July when he hit ZERO home runs.

Berkman&#039;s season numbers only look good because of a stellar 1st half when he hit .347 with 30 doubles, 79 runs, 22 HR and 73 RBI. If you want to pay for that kind of production again on draft day then go ahead.

We all know Morneau has that 30 HR potential and in 2 of the past 3 seasons he has driven in 129+ RBI. Not to mention that his plate patience is getting better as evident by his increasing walk totals from the past three seasons (53,64,76). He&#039;ll be 28 this season which is in the midst of his prime.

Morneau has more upside and on a bit of a ridiculous prediction. I think Berkman, who has hinted at the fact that the majority of ballplayers use steroids, will be busted and we will find out that he has tested positive. So we will see a zap in power or a suspension. I also have a hunch that he will suffer an injury and go on the DL.

Crazy prediction? Yes! However, I have made crazier and they have come true. *cough* Corey Dillon *cough*.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think Berkman&#039;s best year was in 2006 (45 HRs, 136 RBIs) or 2002 (42 HRs, 128 RBIs).

Last year he had a good year...but a HORRIBLE second half (.259 avg, 7 HR, 33 RBI) when compared to his first half (.347 avg, 22 HR, 73 RBI). He wasn&#039;t there for owners when it counted...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How is Morneau ahead or Berkman?

Berkman just had his best season ever and Carlos Lee is back to protect him in the lineup. He&#039;ll be at least as good as Morneau this year, with the potential for better.

Besides those 2 switching, I like the list. Although some different position eligible guys here deserve some mention because they are a lot more valuable somewhere else]]></description>
