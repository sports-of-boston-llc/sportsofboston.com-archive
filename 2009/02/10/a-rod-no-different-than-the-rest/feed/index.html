		<description><![CDATA[I agree, gaining a competitive edge has always been a part of this game and all other games. We knock all these steroid users, now. We knock McGwire, now. However, we saw he had Andro in his locker and that didn&#039;t stop us from cheering him nor did the possibility that homeruns were at all time high stop our cheering for second. It&#039;s easy for us to forget about how much we enjoyed the era just as it is easy for us to place a shadow over it. We&#039;re just as guilty as them. Arod was naive, so were we. If the writers or the commissioners office cared that much about the stats, the legacy, and the good of the game then they would have put a stop to this in the early &#039;90&#039;s. They didn&#039;t, so no rules were broken and all the while we kept on cheering.]]></description>
