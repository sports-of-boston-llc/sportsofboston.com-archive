		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s just a sad day for baseball. Yankee fan, red sox fan, it doesn&#039;t matter. We all lost with this news. We are all going to continue to lose. At this moment, as a fan of the game of baseball, I can only hope that ANYONE else that has used will come out before the rest of the list of 104 major players are released. I&#039;ve never been a huge Arod fan, but I was a fan who wanted to see him break Bond&#039;s record, who believed he could. At this moment no one is safe, Ortiz who broke out in 03-04, Pujols who came out of no where (mcgwire&#039;s last year), none of them. I want to root for someone to break the record and I can&#039;t. I won&#039;t. I refuse to, until this is all cleared up, once and for all. 

I can&#039;t emphasize enough, WE ALL LOST TODAY.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Greatest news ever.

His credibility is now gone and now fans will have even more reason to hate him.

The sheer amount of booing will be deafening at every ballpark in &#039;09.

This was one of the players that everyone &quot;knew&quot; was clean. He was hailed as the &quot;natural&quot; power player and if anybody was clean of steroid allegation, it was A-Rod.

So frankly, who can we trust now? How long before Albert Pujols, Ryan Howard, or any other marquee power player is busted? You can&#039;t seem to trust any player these days.]]></description>
