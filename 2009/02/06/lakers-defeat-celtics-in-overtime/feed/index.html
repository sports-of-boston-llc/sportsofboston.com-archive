		<description><![CDATA[In answer to Sircarlos, are you kidding me?  The foul on Garnett by Gasol thet precipitated the so called foul by Garnett was much more obvious than the one called on KG, yet Gasol got away with it. Had it been properly called, the foul against KG wouldn&#039;t have been an issue.
 And a &quot;struggling&quot; Kobe?  He had a double double with 26 points and 10 rebounds.  I believe that&#039;s above his season average in both categories, or pretty darned close.  He can&#039;t be expected to score 61 points on a regular basis, and I dare say that despite his many misses, Kobe&#039;s totals would be highly pleasing to most other players.  
If this is the Lakers&#039; best without Bynum, I say good, let&#039;s see these guys in the finals.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jeez. Kevin Garnett slapped Derek Fisher as he went for the steal. Come on. That deserves a foul. And the Lakers won because of the guys around Kobe. This is the lakers best without Bynum. Not the prettiest 100 point game for LA but this was some of their best basketball. And they did it with a struggling Kobe. Imagine if everyone had a good night?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Geoff&#039;s last paragraph accurately reflects the worries of all Celtic fanatics, i.e. will the Celts go into another tailspin after another LA streak-ending victory over our team?  The game in NY tonight will probably tell the tale.

LA did to Boston what Boston did to Philly - winning a game they had no right winning.  For the officials to foul out a superstar during crunch time as they did to Garnett for, at best, a pitty pat foul, is just incomprehensible.  Once again, a Celtic star gets absolutely no respect. Can you imagine this happening to Kobe or Lebron? Sure.

Sometimes Doc does things that are inexplicable to me.  Where was the hot handed Eddie House late in the fourth quarter when the Celtics desperately needed scoring power?  Instead, he pinned his hopes on Big Baby, who was having a dismal night, and kept House and Powe - who was having a terrific night - on the bench.  Please explain it to me.

I&#039;ll say one thing for LA.  After butchering their foul shots all night, they made the big ones when they counted.  Unfortunately, Pierce missed two key ones in the fourth quarter, either one of which wins the game.  So near, and yet so far.  Oh well - just win tonight in New York.  Please.]]></description>
