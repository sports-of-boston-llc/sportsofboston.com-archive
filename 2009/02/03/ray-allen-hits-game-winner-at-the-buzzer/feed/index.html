		<description><![CDATA[I think Perk probably is still slowed by his shoulder injury...at least that&#039;s my excuse for him.

And Ken, great point about Pierce. What is with his lack of respect? I know he&#039;ll be a hall of famer, but how come the officials don&#039;t see it the same way? Kobe, LeBron, D-Wade, and Iverson all get special treatment when heading toward the basket. Pierce gets calls sometimes, but oftentimes he&#039;ll be mugged under the hoop and no foul will be called. It&#039;s absurd!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Geoff is certainly correct when he says the Celts were lucky to record a win in this one.  That&#039;s okay, though, considering the total lack of respect that Paul Pierce got from the officials.  If LeBron took that much mugging from the opposing team, he&#039;d be at the line for 30 free throws or so.  It&#039;s a wonder Pierce can still walk after some of the shots he took with no fouls called.  Ridiculous.

I remember watching the Bird, McHale Celtics win many games you were sure they were going to lose.  They&#039;d be outplayed, but somehow managed to win, probably because they just didn&#039;t believe they could lose.  Much the same with these Celts, who somehow manage to pull out these close games.

Kudos to Big Baby, who is playing his heart out and seems to have found a jump shot that can be taken seriously.  And does anybody know where Kendrick Perkins went?  He&#039;s pretty much disappeared lately after playing the best basketball of his career.  After Al Jefferson ate him for lunch on Sunday, I figured he&#039;d be up for a major effort against Philly, but once again he was a total non-factor.  I guess without Garnett spoon feeding him for layups, there&#039;s just not much you can expect from him, at least scoring-wise.]]></description>
