		<description><![CDATA[I think I have to disagree with  Geoff concerning the state of the Boston bench.  I think it IS a major concern, especially after seeing the benches of LA, San Antonio, and Cleveland this past weekend.  I think all three of those teams have a lot more coming off the bench than we do this year.  I hope the Celts are looking for some help here - an impact player you can count on to give the team a lift.  The Celtic bench is just too inconsistent, and though they play well in spurts, they have no staying power in the long run. 

I hate to say it, but the Lakers have taken over the mantle of the best team in the NBA.  Their current road trip was nothing less than remarkable.  Beating the Celts and the Cavs on their own home courts...well, give credit where it&#039;s due.  I still think the Celts can beat them, but not if the bench remains as it is.]]></description>
