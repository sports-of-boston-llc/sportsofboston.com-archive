		<description><![CDATA[I really don&#039;t think it matters whether or not these athletes take performance enhancing drugs, because the only people they are hurting is themselves. I mean taking a drug can&#039;t make you hit a baseball or slam a basketball if your only four foot tall, get real these guys already have the natural talent.
, some losers just don&#039;t and are jealous]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike Schmidt brought up a good point today. The players during the &#039;70&#039;s and &#039;80&#039;s were no better. They were all on amphetitmines. Schmidt, Mattingly, they all were. It was the culture of that time. They were on them during the game. That is a performance enhancing drug and none of those guys were held back from the hall of fame if their statistics allocated their acceptance. 

Basically I say this, if the baseball allowed these players to take steroids then they didn&#039;t break the rules. The hall of fame is a museum. It tells the story of baseball, the dead-ball era to the steroid era. We quickly forget how mcgwires and sosas homeruns saved baseball after the strike. It won over many fans.

If the sport allows it, it should only be frowned upon, at worse. All these players McGwire, Palmero, Clemens, Bonds, Arod: ALL MUST BE IN THE HALL OF FAME. The fans and the historians will know when they played and what happened. If some players want to prove their clean, good for them, they knew what was going on and DIDN&#039;T STOP IT, didn&#039;t say anything about it why? Because it was a part of the culture. All are guilty. All have always been guilty. The era must be represented in the hall of fame.

On a side note for Lokesh: the NY giants stole their signs from a scoreboard signals in centerfield. I know, weird, but it worked. They overtook a 14 game deficit in August to win the pennant.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[kc, yea but they dont use it to get an edge. its not like they gain rapping speed/strength thus enabling them to be better musicians, which leads them to making more money etc.

baker, can&#039;t really argue with that. I guess i was just trying to say its not fair that someone uses roids to make their way into the game mostly because but not limited to the fact that they take the place of someone who is clean.

Some one who knows the pitch location and which pitch is coming, it depends on how the batter acquired such information. If the coach/pitcher/catcher is not doing a good job of hiding communication, why will the batter not take advantage, y&#039;know. I just view steroid use as a more serious offense, but in essence you are not wrong in making such a point either.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[lokesh - You mention those rappers...but they&#039;re sadly involved too. I hope you know that rappers/performers like 50 Cent were discovered to have purchased (and probably used) HGH. It&#039;s scary that performance-enhancing drugs are entering the entertainment business.

Baker - MLB only cares about keeping the game clean now because the federal government and public got on their ass about it. Good thing they stopped now...because what if Alex Rodriguez soared to 915 home runs or something..and years later was found to have been taking steroids for the majority of his career? That would be MUCH worse than revealing it now. 

Sure, revealing the &#039;roids killed the careers of Mark McGwire, Rafael Palmeiro and ruined the legacies Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens, but the game would&#039;ve suffered greatly if this circus continued for another 20 years.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well what sports and its stars are ultimately judged at are as role models. People felt the best role models came from baseball and worst ones came from basketball. What&#039;s the difference between a player on steroids and a player knowing the location and what pitch is coming...the latter has a better chance of hitting a homerun. Competitive edges are and will always be a part of the game. Steroids only became illegal in 2004. If MLB cared that much about keeping the game clean, they would have stopped it 20 years ago, when it started to become prevalent, almost in your face.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[umm jk, but seriously:

like you said, sport always involve controversy. however you can&#039;t compare  someone who has tatoos, makes millions by bouncing a ball, and makes millions by rapping music to someone using steriods. the former is entertainment, the latter is outright cheating. 

whats the difference between watching a bunch of players on steroids play, and a bunch of robots play? none what so ever.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Every sport has there flaws.

Football has top picks who start riots in strip clubs, pro bowl wide receivers who shoot people at their bar, and superbowl mvp&#039;s who are suspect of actually killing someone. It&#039;s a sport that leaves their players with brain damage. It&#039;s a sport who&#039;s stars are suspected of major drug use...during the game (LT with the Giants has told friends he was high on Cocaine during games which helped him because he couldn&#039;t feel the hits he was delivering on people or the bones he was snapping...Joe Theismann).

Basketball is a sport where most of it&#039;s players are covered in tattoo&#039;s, where weapon possession, and explicit music albums made by all-stars are common practice. It&#039;s a sport where it&#039;s own officials have been caught betting on the games they are officiating. 

Hockey has it&#039;s dirty hits.

Soccer has it&#039;s massive fan riots.

Cricket...well never mind about that.

Why should we think that baseball can escape any controversy? When we find out something is flawed about this game, why are we surprised...every time? A-rod took Steroids, just as Gaylord Perry use to doctor balls with foreign substances, just as the historic NY Giants magical run capped off by the shot heard round the world...were stealing signs, just as Ty Cobb spiked any infielder who had the gaul to field a throw to the base they were covering as he slid into it. 

When you are a part of an era, of a culture, there is very little chance you can come out of it clean. From now on we should assume that no was safe from it. That they were smart not to, that if they did resist, they wouldn&#039;t have gotten the contract that everyone else was getting. That they could do it because it wasn&#039;t illegal. We can believe all of this and just accept that it happened and hope that it&#039;s over.

We can believe that whoever is doing it now has been or will be caught, however, we MUST believe that if it&#039;s not steroids, if it&#039;s not stealing signs, then it will be something else. No professional sport is safe and anyone who believes it is: are just Naive. 

All we can do is watch and enjoy the game for the simplicity of it, which can NEVER EVER be taken away.]]></description>
