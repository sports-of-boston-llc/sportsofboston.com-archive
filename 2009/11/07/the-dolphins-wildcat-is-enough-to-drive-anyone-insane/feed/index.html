		<description><![CDATA[Really, somebody in Boston wrote a whole article attacking an effective offensive formation that single-handedly destroyed your precious patriots against a former 1-15 team.  Too bad Belichek didn&#039;t have any spies on top of that one. The truth is -just like any Boston franchise- you blame everyone but yourselves for your loss. In 2 more weeks you will see that the Dolphins aren&#039;t the joke you make them out to be without the wildcat. In the meanwhile - in the words of Rodney Harrison- take off your skirts!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not only is everything above true, but the Wildcat is just the old single wing offense from the 30s brought back to life. 

So not only do NFL coaches kill fads like 13 year olds, they also have the same ignorance of history]]></description>
