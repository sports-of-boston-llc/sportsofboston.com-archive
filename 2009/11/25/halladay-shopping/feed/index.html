		<description><![CDATA[I think I&#039;d only trade Buchholz and Kelly for Felix, or maybe Albert Pujols. That&#039;s it. Just those two. I&#039;d consider Grienke, but he still has to prove himself more.

Adrian Gonzalez is good, but I think the Sox have enough to get him without giving up Kelly OR Buchholz. 

I&#039;d be willing to send Buchholz to the Jays for Halladay, but not both him and Kelly. The Sox have to hold onto Kelly if possible.

I got an idea: instead of trading for Halladay, why don&#039;t the Sox sign John Lackey, Jason Bay, and trade the prospects for either Gonzalez or Miguel Cabrera? Yeah, I know that situation is too ideal haha.]]></description>
