		<description><![CDATA[Wow.
Compare this statement:
&quot;Epstein has changed his mentality as General Manager. Instead of looking out for what is best for the team, he is trying to get big name players in order to one-up the Yankees.&quot;
With this one,two paragraphs later:
&quot;I firmly believe that if the Red Sox do not make a move during Free Agency this offseason and either re-sign Bay or sign Matt Holliday, and then fail to bring home a championship, Epstein’s job could come into question.&quot;
So what do you want?  Do you want him to make a big move, or not?  do you want him to spend a couple hundred million on guys who are now or have recently been at the top of their game?  Do you want him to sign 35 year olds, or 25 year olds with promise but no track record?  Truth is, a lot of moves don&#039;t work out because of injuries, inability to play the big market, or what have you.  
I, for one, think Theo has his head on facing forward.  It may not work out all the time, but even when it hasn&#039;t worked out the team has still been in there for 95 plus wins and a crack at the season.  Easy to second guess.  So tell me, you tell me what he should do, how much he should spend, and we will judge you at the end of the season.  How&#039;s that???]]></description>
