		<description><![CDATA[Despite Pierce&#039;s inability to stop Peja, I&#039;m a bit in awe of the level of his play this year.  I don&#039;t think he&#039;s ever been better all around, and there&#039;s a power and speed in his driving to the hoop that simply wasn&#039;t there before.  I think he&#039;s taken a few lessons from LeBron when heading for the hoop to slam one in.  He seems able to make the critical shots when called for, plays team basketball, and is no slouch on the boards as well.  Keep it up!

When this team is in focus, they&#039;re unstoppable.  With the magnificent bench they now have, plus the level of defense they can play, it&#039;s hard to see them losing more than a handful of games if they stay healthy.]]></description>
