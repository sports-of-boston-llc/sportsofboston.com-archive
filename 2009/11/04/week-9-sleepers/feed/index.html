		<description><![CDATA[I think Celek.

Barber is only going to get 14-15 carries and he hasn&#039;t topped more than 53 rush yds since week 2. The Eagles have only allowed 4 rushing TDs all season, and that includes just 1 rushing TD in their last five games.

Celek on the other hand has been the most targeted Eagles&#039; receiver (yes, that includes DeSean Jackson) over the past two games.

Philly&#039;s opponent, Dallas, is 22nd in the league with 237 pass yds allowed per game, and the Cowboys have given up two passing TDs in each of their last three games.]]></description>
