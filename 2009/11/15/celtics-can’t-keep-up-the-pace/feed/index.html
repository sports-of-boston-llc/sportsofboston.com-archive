The Pacers with the win improved to 4-3...and the Celtics dropped to 8-3, which means theyve played FOUR more games this early in the season. that&#039;s just ridiculous...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s going on here?  This team bears no resemblance to the team that began the season looking invincible.  Their defense has collapsed and they look like they have no real interest in competing.  Rondo has played the last two games in a fog.  House has forgotten how to shoot, and is embarrasing as a point guard.  Rondo can&#039;t hit a foul shot or a jumper. Three point shots?  We can&#039;t seem to defend them and we sure can&#039;t hit them lately.

I think their early success has gone to their heads.  Right now they look old and slow.  I hope Doc can light a fire under them before it gets to be a habit.]]></description>
