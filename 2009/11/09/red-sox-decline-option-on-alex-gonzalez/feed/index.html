		<description><![CDATA[I think there&#039;s a good chance they sign him. JJ Hardy probably would have been a target if the price were lower for the Sox. Buchholz or Bard? They&#039;re the replacements for Beckett and Papelbon. Good move not acquiring him at that cost.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a very strange move.  They obviously thought $6M was too much, but he&#039;s a great defensive player and the only quality shortstop of anyone who played the position last season. I don&#039;t think anyone in the minors is ready and I agree that there isn&#039;t a great option out there. Why not bring him back for one more year as a bridge to the future?]]></description>
