		<description><![CDATA[wow I just realized FC Barcelona&#039;s pursuit of Cesc Fabregas is the same
as the Red Sox trying to get Hanley back: Both were traded away as highly touted prospects, both are one of the best players in their respective sports, both haven&#039;t even reached their peak, both will command ridiculous transfer fees, and both their former teams need them badly. hah.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While the quality wasn&#039;t always great, the Red Sox seemed to eek out just enough at the position. It wasn&#039;t really until this year when Nick Green&#039;s hot start ended that the team was truly suffering from the position. Second base was like that until Pedroia, so hopefully the answer is in the works.]]></description>
