		<description><![CDATA[The 4th and 2 call was definitely all or nothing, I don&#039;t mind the call Belichick made.  I don&#039;t think it was lack of confidence in his defense as much as more confidence in his offense.  And it is Peyton, he would&#039;ve went 65 yards as easy as he went the 30 or so.

Hope they meet again in the playoffs.]]></description>
