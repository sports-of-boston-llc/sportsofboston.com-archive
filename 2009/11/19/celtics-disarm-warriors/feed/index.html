		<description><![CDATA[Sharkey - that was an absolutely perfect description of the game.  There&#039;s clearly something wrong with the way the Celts are approaching games all of a sudden.  It&#039;s like watching Roy Jones Jr., the great, seemingly invincible boxer, suddenly get old one night- virtually without warning- and become a foil for younger fighters.  The Celts continued to look old until the end of the third quarter, as you said, and were damned lucky to win that game against a depleted Warrior squad.  
I am not looking forward to Friday&#039;s game at all.  I&#039;m really afraid of what Orlando might do to the Celts, even though they have injury problems of their own.  Hope I&#039;m wrong, but the Celts are just going through the motions.]]></description>
