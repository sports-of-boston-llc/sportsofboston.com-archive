		<description><![CDATA[There is a pattern with all of those signing that you mentioned and that is there was a real pressing need for those guys at the time of their signings. 
2004- Red Sox needed a #2 after Pedro and still hadn’t won a WS
2005- First time the Red Sox had a need at SS since 1996
2006- After Renteria failed Sox needed to answer with another signing (this is the only one I think they seriously overpaid probably due to panic in the front office)
2007- Red Sox saw the demise of Trot Nixon in 2006 and finished out of first or second in the AL East for the first time since 1997
I wouldn&#039;t necessarily call John Lackey a pressing need because while the Red Sox staff does have some questions, I don’t think they need to go as far as spending near $100 million solving that problem. They would be better off getting one of the lesser pitchers like Rich Harden, Ben Sheets, etc. for cheaper dollars and focus on extending their current ace, Josh Beckett, past the upcoming 2010 season. 
As for Bay, I am not as big a fan of this guy as the majority is, but there is an obvious need for a big bat in this lineup so if we cannot obtain an Adrian Gonzalez or Miguel Cabrera then I would definitely be for paying Jason Bay $16-$18 million a year.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[George:

&quot;They sign low-risk contracts and will only spend big time money on a player that is in his 20s...&quot;

Recent signings by this front office suggest otherwise, my friend:

JD Drew (at 32 signed for five years, $70 million)
Julio Lugo (at 31 signed for four years, $36 million)
Edgar Renteria (turned 30 the year he signed his four year, $40 million deal)
Curt Schilling (as part of the trade with the DBacks, the Sox extended the 38-year-old&#039;s $13 million contract three years)

Jason Bay is 31 and will be seeking a long-term, $15-$18M annual deal. Are you also suggesting the Sox shouldn&#039;t sign him? 

The Sox would be well within their means spending up to the $170 M luxury tax threshold. In fact, they can fill all their holes, add Lackey, and still be well below that figure. They can do it and they should.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re right about one thing. The Red Sox will never beat the Yankees in spending money. It&#039;s because they (1) don&#039;t have as much of it and (2) have different philosophies in the front office. The Yankees have been spending countless of millions of dollars on veterans and still that philosophy has gotten them only one championship in nine years. 

The Red Sox do it right. They sign low-risk contracts and will only spend big time money on a player that is in his 20&#039;s and has shown that he can produce in the majors. They spend a lot of their money in development and scouting and it shows with players like Dustin Pedroia, Kevin Youkilis, Jon Lester, Daniel Bard, Clay Buchholz and Jacoby Ellsbury. They have rebuilt a once-barren farm system and now have a great foundation of young talent that gives them a great deal of flexibility.
Lackey will be 36 years old at the end of this contract and he is already has shown arm troubles the last two seasons so I doubt the Red Sox are going to pay him $17 million over five years. I&#039;d rather have them sign Rich Harden or Ben Sheets to a low-risk one year contract and focus on extending Josh Beckett through 2014. The Red SOx aren&#039;t desparate enough to pony up crazy money for a top of the line starter just yet.]]></description>
