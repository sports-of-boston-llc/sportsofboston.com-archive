		<description><![CDATA[I agree, good thing Pierce is still able to carry the team when they need it. Rasheed hasn&#039;t been making too many 3-pointers but he continues to take them, maybe that&#039;s why he&#039;s an established 3-point shooter? Rondo&#039;s and Allen&#039;s struggles will be worked out over time as they have both shown the ability to make the same plays that they are missing. Whatever the reason is to why they are struggling, even against poor teams, will be figured out hopefully soon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Looks like every game will be an adventure.  No sure things anymore.  Instead of &quot;invinvible&quot;, the Celts have beome &quot;winceable&quot;.  I wince every time Rasheed shoots a 3 pointer.  I wince every time Rondo takes a jumper or goes to the free throw line. I wince as House and Allen clang 3 pointers off the front rim.  I wince every time our opponents shoot an uncontested 3 pointer.

Thank goodness for Pierce - at least he remembers how to go to the basket, and still seems to have some juice left in his game.]]></description>
