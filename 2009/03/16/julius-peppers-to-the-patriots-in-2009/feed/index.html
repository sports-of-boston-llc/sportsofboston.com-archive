		<description><![CDATA[This is exactly why they moved Cassel and his $14.5M since they must be reasonably assured he wouldn&#039;t be playing much as a Patriot.  The KC deal dumped salary to enable such a move (and saved them $1M roster bonus on Vrabel which KC picked up) and got them a second round pick at roughly 1/5th the cost of a first rounder.  Like you said, the Panthers don&#039;t want to guarantee that kind of money to a first rounder and they want to dump him anyway (money and malcontent).  A fresh start should be good for Peppers who could have a huge impact for the Pats.  A great move by Belichick and Company.  They have tons of picks anyway, they could spare this one.]]></description>
