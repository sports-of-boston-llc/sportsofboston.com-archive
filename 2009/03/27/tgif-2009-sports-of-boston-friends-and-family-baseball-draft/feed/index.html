I am just naming players I like and don&#039;t like. Deal with it.


Aubrey Huff = Contract Year.

		<description><![CDATA[KC, thanks for defending Volquez.  That&#039;s exactly my reasoning, he&#039;s a K machine.  He pitches in a hitter&#039;s park, of course, and everyone has a book on him now, but there&#039;s too much upside to a guy that can strike guys out like he can.

As for Dice-K, I&#039;m steering clear of him.  I don&#039;t know how many times last year, he would throw so many pitches because he walked 4-5 or 8 guys and left after five.  Because he got run support, he got tons of wins while barely qualifying.  In Japan, these guys throw till their arms fall off, but the Sox love their pitch counts and with his continued wildness, he&#039;s going to be a 5 inning pitcher again.  With the Sox reduced offense, his wins will drop if he regularly goes only five.  And, as Pete noted, he&#039;s asking for ERA trouble when you put that many guys on.  That said, there&#039;s a good value there in round 10 because of the K&#039;s and the wins he will get.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Allow me to defend Daisuke Matsuzaka and Mike&#039;s pick of Edinson Volquez.

Sure, Volquez wasn&#039;t off-the-charts good in the second half, but his K numbers are too high to ignore. He may have trouble allowing baserunners, but his strikeout numbers are extremely good, and in Round 9, that&#039;s not really a huge reach.

And Dice-K....no matter what, he strikes people out. I expect his ERA to rise...but I can deal with 15-18 wins, 3.50 ERA, and 180 Ks for a 10th Round pick.]]></description>
