		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Geoff and Doc that easing Garnett back into the flow is a wise choice, albeit frustrating to watch.  I only hope that Orlando really believes that they&#039;re a better team than the Celts, because it will be great fun to watch them face reality if they play the Celts at full strength.  Hell, they barely beat the Celts on their homecourt in the &quot;biggest game of the year&quot; for them, with the Celts giving a second rate performance with a still depleted lineup. Good luck beating the Celts if Boston ever gets its full team back on the court.

By the way, I&#039;ve figured out the exact date that the world will end.  It&#039;ll happen when Kendrick Perkins manages to go two straight games without committing a foul while attempting to set a pick. Don&#039;t hold your breath.]]></description>
