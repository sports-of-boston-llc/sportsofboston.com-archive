		<description><![CDATA[I agree wholeheartidely with Belisle and Bu &#039;98. I was at BU from 2003-2007 and we should have won the conference at least two or three of those years, despite being in the Taylor Coppenwrath era. Heck, we even beat Michigan a couple times on the road and nearly beat them at Agganis. 

Over my four years we had player after player either transfer, leave the school or simply get cut from the team for a variety of reasons (Etienne Brower - Umass, Tony Gaffney - Umass, Brian Geffen - Quinnipiac, Ben Coblyn - Umass and Corey Hassan - Sacred Heart) but what it comes down to is Wolff recruiting players who weren&#039;t ready for big time basketball.

You look at the talent this team has and wonder why the inconsistencies are there. A lot of the reason BU has struggled in recent years is the lack of a deep front court and a true point guard (none really since Chaz Carr). Especially with Agganis Arena one would think recruiting some quality players shouldn&#039;t be much of an issue and when he does get a prime prospect (Corey Lowe) it just doesn&#039;t seem Wolff knew how to bring the best out of him.

There is no question Wolff is a defensive whiz but the frustrating nature of his offensive schemes just boggled my mind at some times. 

I see this as a great chance to breath new life into the program and I would bet big money on BU making the NCAA tournament next season.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Absolutely overdue. Wolff did a really good job early in his tenure, but there is simply no excuse for choking in a league as bad as the America East year after year. I hope this is the start of some real investment in the basketball, starting with moving to a more appropriate conference. I read a quote in the NY Times from the head of America East saying they want to be like the Patriot League. Well, that would require more than two decent academic schools (BU and Binghamton). BU has the facilities, size and location to be a solid mid-major program. Now they need the conference, coach and commitment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[He should have been gone years ago.  My guess is they kept him on because his son was on the team.  As far as I can see the player was a nonscorer who majored in questionable plays.  I would like to see BU bring in a coach who believes in competition and CLEAN play.  It has been many years since BU could be proud of their men&#039;s bball team.]]></description>
