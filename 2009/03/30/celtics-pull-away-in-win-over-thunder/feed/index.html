		<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s fair to question why KG isn&#039;t by his team while injured. It appears now that his knee injury is worse than we imagined, so maybe he&#039;s not showing up on the bench to avoid the media after the game.

The Celtics appear to want to keep all injury-related news under wraps, and leaving Doc Rivers to answer all injury-related questions.

I dont really know the reason, though...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, Josh, thanks for the explanation, but I&#039;d like to believe that ANY player who shows up for the game would like to play and help the team win.  How did Garnett get so &quot;sensitive&quot; that he just can&#039;t take the frustration, when other players are not exempted from their presence on the bench, especially considering the undeniable mental plus that Garnett represents when he&#039;s sitting on the bench advising his teammates.  You could see his importance on the bench when he played those first and third quarter minutes.  Everyone felt his presence was a huge factor even though he couldn&#039;t play in the second and fourth quarters.

Say what you will, it seems extremely selfish to me for him to be satisfied with watching the game on TV when he could be offering so much to the team by simply being present on the bench when they play.

As for it being a coaching decision as well, I can&#039;t imagine any high school or college coach in the country accepting such a thing, and I really feel that it&#039;s lame for the Celtic staff to put up with such elitism on the part of one of the players. It certainly sends a message to the other players - Kevin gets what Kevin wants and it&#039;s too bad you&#039;re not important enough to get such favors.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with the bench production being a huge factor recently in the absence of KG, but the reason he isn&#039;t normally there is not because he feels that he is any better than the &quot;team&quot;. It is far from that. 

On a Celtics preview show on NESN, it was made clear that when KG is in the building, he&#039;s there to play. If he shows up to a game and is able to stand, he is going to want to be in that game to help his team win. It was both a coaching and player decision for him to not be on the bench every game that he is not playing in. 

Garnett and the Celtics both know that the reciprocating love is there and when he&#039;s not at the games, he&#039;s rehabbing his knee so he won&#039;t miss any of the playoff games when the time comes.

Right now, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sportsfan4.com/basketball/slipping-cs/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Doc Rivers is focused on the health of the team&lt;/a&gt; and having everyone ready for the post-season and it should be another great one for Boston and it&#039;s fans.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Celts seem to be getting into the habit of sleeping the first three quarters before they get serious and put the game away.  Could be a dangerous situation with better teams, though they certainly didn&#039;t play that way against Atlanta.  Guess it depends on whether or not they feel the opposition is worthy of a four quarter effort.

Don&#039;t know what they&#039;re feeding Glen Davis these days, but they&#039;d better keep plenty on hand.  Looks like it would be wise to insure that Baby and Powe don&#039;t go anywhere when they become free agents after the season.

Donny Marshall finally talked about the unspoken question concerning Garnett, i.e. why is he not on the bench when he&#039;s not playing? Considering how important his presence is as a cheerleader and semi coach (I think it was Ray Allen who said we need Kevin&#039;s voice out there), what&#039;s keeping him off the bench, and why is it allowed by the coaching staff?  Considering what he gets paid, and how vocal he is about the &quot;team effort&quot; concept, you&#039;d think he could show up for the games he&#039;s not playing and help in any way he can.  Anybody know the answer?]]></description>
