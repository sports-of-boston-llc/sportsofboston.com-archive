		<description><![CDATA[That was one hell of an effort by the Celtics.  An amazing win despite being shorthanded and shortchanged by the officials.  I suppose Cleveland would have won easily if they&#039;d shot well from the foul line, considering that they went there 22 times more than the Celtics.  How that disparity was possible, with the Celtics pounding the inside on offense, is anybody&#039;s guess. As Tommy Heinsohn screamed over and over  - &quot;It&#039;s criminal!&quot;.

I suppose we should be used to it by now, but it&#039;s damned frustrating to watch this sort of officiating on such a regular basis.  Terrific play by Pierce, Powe, and Baby (before he was ejected), and despite the fact that Marbury is clearly not able to shoot well just yet, he looked good running the point and seems more than able to distribute the ball and play defense.  Eventually, he should prove to be a real ace in the hole.  I also like Mikki Moore&#039;s intensity.  Two good additions to the team.

Now let&#039;s hope there&#039;s no letdown against Orlando on Sunday.]]></description>
