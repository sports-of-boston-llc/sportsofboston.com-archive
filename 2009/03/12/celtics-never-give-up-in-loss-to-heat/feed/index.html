		<description><![CDATA[It looks like KG will be back at the end of next week now. I&#039;m glad they&#039;re holding him back, but it looks like we&#039;re going to be the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference.

Marbury&#039;s play has been disappointing, but to me it looks like he&#039;s trying. I&#039;d love for him to get increased playing time down the stretch to get him ready for the playoffs.

I hope with KG back that the Celts can get back in sync in time, though I&#039;d love for Doc to give some of the guys like Pierce and Allen some much needed rest.

It will definitely be interesting...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It was a valiant effort by the depleted Celtics, but I fear it&#039;s an indication of things to come in the next few weeks.  One thing&#039;s for sure - forget about any home court advantage in the playoffs.  What&#039;s more, even if the regular starters get back together again, it&#039;s hard to imagine they&#039;ll be in sync in time to pose a real threat to the likes of Cleveland or Orlando or even Atlanta and Detroit.

I was very disturbed at the sheer idiocy of Perkins and Moore at the start of the Miami game.  With a grand total of three bigs in uniform, the two of them went on an immediate fouling spree.  Yes, I know they were pitty pat fouls, but that&#039;s standard operating practice for the officials when the Celts are playing, and the big guys ought to get it by now.

Also disturbing, is the lack of progress for Marbury.  His shooting skills seem to have disappeared.  I think a college guy would look better shooting the ball than Marbury.  I know - he&#039;s rusty, hasn&#039;t got his legs yet, etc., etc.  But this is a former all star who is not exactly an old man.  How can he be so godawful in the shooting department?  

And while I&#039;m at it, will somebody wake up Gabe Pruitt?  This is the moment every second stringer waits for - injuries to others give him a chance to play.  It&#039;s his moment to shine, to make some sort of mark.  Instead, he&#039;s sleep walking out there, scared to death to take a shot, and his facial and body language says just one thing - &quot;I&#039;m a scared rabbit loser.&quot;  Get with it buddy, and at least go down fighting.

Kudos to Powe for some terrific efforts, and Allen and Pierce are doing a great job despite obvious exhaustion at the end of games.

By the way, nobody is putting a time table on Garnett&#039;s coming back.  Is he out for the season?]]></description>
