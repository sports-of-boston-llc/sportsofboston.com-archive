		<description><![CDATA[BU looks like the real deal.  They have the offense and the goaltending and the scary thing is they&#039;re young!  Even though they only beat NU by one point and they played pretty tight, I think BU is the best team in HEA and should win the tournament.  They are definitely among a few elite teams in the NCAAs this season and have a darn good shot to win another championship.]]></description>

Thankfully Gerbe&#039;s not with BC anymore!]]></description>
