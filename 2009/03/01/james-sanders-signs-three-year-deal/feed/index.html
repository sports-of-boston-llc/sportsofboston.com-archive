		<description><![CDATA[Parks, I think it&#039;s a decent deal for Cassel, but losing Vrabel is big. It&#039;s tough to complain about getting a high second round pick, which is in effect a late first round pick, for a guy who a year ago was pretty much worthless. 

I understand Vrabel had an off year in 2008 and is entering a contract year, but he&#039;s only counting $4 million or so on the cap, so his inclusion is very surprising. Personally, I would&#039;ve rather gotten a late second round or early third round pick and given up just Cassel than to give up Vrabel.

I think it would be very wise for the Patriots to lock up Wilfork to a long term deal. His price won&#039;t be affected by Haynesworth all that much because he&#039;s always said he wants to finish his career with the Pats.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s your take on on the 34th pick for Cassel/Vrabel? Do you also think by opening up the extra cap space this will allow the Pats to sign Wilfork to a long term deal or did the recent Haynesworth deal price the Pats out of his services?]]></description>
