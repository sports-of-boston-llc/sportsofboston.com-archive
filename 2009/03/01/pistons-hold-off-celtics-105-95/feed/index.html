		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;ve gotta wonder what Detroit was thinking when they traded Billups for Iverson.  They&#039;re a helluva lot better team when Hamilton starts, and it&#039;s remarkable that it took them so long to figure that out.  Which means that you gave Billups up to get an aging bench player whose team ethics are non exixtent. Duh.

As for the Celtics, it&#039;s clear that without Garnett they&#039;re at best the third best team in the league.  Despite some really good efforts from Big Baby and Powe, you just can&#039;t replace Garnett&#039;s defensive skills and all around intensity. Let&#039;s hope Garnett is fit and ready for the playoffs, or the Celts will be a serious underdog to ever make it out of the East.]]></description>
