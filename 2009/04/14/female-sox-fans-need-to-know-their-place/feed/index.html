		<description><![CDATA[As a baseball man, someone who has dedicated their life to baseball, I love to see casual fans at the games. I love to see &quot;4-year fans&quot; at the games. I just love to see people appreciating the environment the games take place in, and perhaps, if just momentarily, the artistry of the sport. Not everybody will be as taken by the game as you and I, Joe. 

Baseball has done itself a great disservice in not having baseball available to be played at the high school level and above for young women. Sometimes I wonder why they want anything to do with a sport that doesn&#039;t support their participation. If the fashionable, basest female fan -- aka the &quot;pink hat&quot; -- one day becomes an aficionado, it will be in spite of a sport that doesn&#039;t welcome them as it should. And softball, while similar, is not baseball. It&#039;s different. It supports a this is for the girls, this is for the boys mentality, and that&#039;s not a good message to send.

One of the great things about baseball is that it&#039;s played in a park. Like all parks, it welcomes passerbys and people-watchers, cityscapers, and those who love a good sunset. To say that only a certain few can take in a ballgame goes against the very essence of the ballpark experience. I believe in the game. If a &quot;pink hat&quot; were to enter the ballpark five times with their boyfriend, if just to connect with someone they care about, I know that maybe that sixth time they will see a triple play, a game-winning home run, a no-hitter, a brawl, a manager get tossed, a foul ball knock the hot dog out of their hand, and then they&#039;ll have a connection and interest in the game they&#039;ll never shake. It&#039;s just a shame that may never happen because Red Sox tickets are too expensive.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pete, 

We can go around and around in this argument with which female fans are &quot;true fans&quot; and which are &quot;bandwagon jumpers&quot;. I suppose that this sort of conversation is natural to a man, considering they aren&#039;t typically questioned when they claim to be a fan of any particular team. 

I happen to be a Red Sox fan. Are there a ton of new fans in Sox Nation after the past few World Series wins? Sure. But, for the love of God, let people be the kind of fan they want to be. Not everyone was raised on baseball, but at least they try to appreciate America&#039;s pastime.

For more insight, I have my own blog and opinions on female fandom.

		<description><![CDATA[I know Pete&#039;s against the pink clothes...but I think he&#039;s also against the bandwagon fans who goto the games wearing those clothes.

I tend to compare these &quot;pinkhats&quot; to little kid sports fans. When I was little, I barely knew anything about sports, I just liked cheering for the home team. I think most pinkhats generally enjoy cheering for the team but don&#039;t know too much about the players or stats. Now, that doesn&#039;t mean they can&#039;t or don&#039;t want to learn more, and eventually they can graduate to be &quot;real&quot; Red Sox fans.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How can you say your article isn&#039;t sexist when it specifically targets women, granted, a specific kind of woman, but female specific nonetheless. And I&#039;d really be careful of how you choose your words, &quot;The women I attack...&quot; isn&#039;t quite the best thing to say...ever. 

ANYWAYS, if it is the bandwagon fans you are upset about, then complain about that and then include the pink-hatted fans as a subcategory rather than the target of your &quot;attack.&quot; You&#039;re right, I wouldn&#039;t be as upset with your perspective, but you are targeting a women-specific demographic, thus making it sexist. 

Also, how do you pretend to know why all of them are cheering? It&#039;s true that their presence is likely the product of the Red Sox success, BUT SO AREN&#039;T LARGE AMOUNTS OF BANDWAGON FANS. Bandwagon fandom is another issue in and of itself and if you wanted to pick on a crowd there is more than enough material to whine about, but they are part of every professional sport, so deal with it. Your sports elitism that puts you above other people that don&#039;t have the time or drive to study sports is appalling. Get over it and get over yourself. You are not defending hardcore female fans, and you are just perpetuating a stereotypes. Congratulations.

It&#039;s very easy to pick pink hats out of the crowd, but since the Sox have started winning, they&#039;ve sold out their games. I can guarantee you the difference is not bandwagon female fans with pink hats.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, I wouldn&#039;t call my argument completely sexist since I clearly state that I am not on a tirade against all women. I chose to express my opinion about a very specific group. 

I&#039;d also like to point out that if I had written about male fans who fall into this category then there would not be such an uproar. But no, as soon as somebody writes negatively about women, he gets jumped on. Isn&#039;t that sexist in its own right?

Over and over again everyone is commenting on how the Red Sox organization needs these women in order to generate revenue and make money since women are now a key demographic. What do you want me to say to that? &quot;Who cares? The Red Sox don&#039;t need women. They can make money another way, blah blah blah, etc etc etc&quot;. I won&#039;t argue that the Sox cash in big time with female fans and I give the organization credit for making money off of women who don&#039;t have a clue about what they are cheering for. 

Again, I am attacking women who cheer for the team and claim to be huge fans since the dawn of time but who clearly are not dedicated to this franchise. I am NOT attacking women who actually are die hard fans. Frankly, these women have to go through the bulls**t of being categorized with the &quot;pink hats&quot; and endure superficial judgments just because they are women. To me, that is not fair.

The women I attack don&#039;t go to games to connect with their significant others, but rather to jump on the bandwagon.

Given the Sox current rocky start to the season (even though Wakefield just pitched a gem), I guarantee, GUARANTEE you that if the Sox missed the playoffs/finished dead last in the AL East, then these women would not be cheering so loudly. Hell, you think the Kansas City Royals or Washington Nationals have such a rabid female fan base? I highly doubt it. In short, if the Sox sucked, then this group of female fans would not give the time of day to our boys.]]></description>
