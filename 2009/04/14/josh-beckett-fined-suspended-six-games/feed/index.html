		<description><![CDATA[haha easy there. Beckett&#039;s not on roids. He&#039;s hot, and he throws inside.

The Angels were just trying to get in Beckett&#039;s head. They did with Kendrick the previous at bat, and again with Abreu. The ump had NO business granting Abreu time.

Beckett did not intend to hit Abreu in the head, but he did intend to send a message. 

The punishment is just. Beckett will probably appeal the suspension, and MLB will probably reduce it to five games, which means Beckett misses one start anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The fine is based on his actions after he threw the pitch according to Bob Watson. If he had any remorse for the pitch then he shouldn&#039;t have told Abreu to &#039;get your fuckin ass back in the fuckin box&quot; and he then shouldn&#039;t of started an arguement scisocia. IF anything Beckett looked all too much like Clemens, when he was on the Yankees, aka when he was on the roids.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[From what I saw it looked like he just lost control. Abreu called time during Beckett&#039;s windup and the pitch just got away from him. If anything, I&#039;d say the umpire should have denied the request for time.

This punishment is bogus in my book.]]></description>
