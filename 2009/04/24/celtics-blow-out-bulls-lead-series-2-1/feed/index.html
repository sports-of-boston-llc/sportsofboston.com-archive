		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a die hard Cletics fan. I think Rondo was stepped up this postseason with all the players heading off to the nurses room. But I was for sure that the Bulls where going to come back. Glad they didn&#039;t. I think that even though the Celtics have 3 players out, this is the perfect time to show and prove that they are a strong team and don&#039;t rely on one player: KG.

		<description><![CDATA[Now THAT was Boston Celtic basketball!  What a pleasure to see them respond in what I felt was really a &quot;must&quot; game, and retake the homecourt adantage.  Now they know they can beat the Bulls, so let&#039;s just hope they don&#039;t take Sunday off and count on home court to pull them through. 

Intensity is the key, on offense and defense, and you could see what happened when they let down a bit in the third quarter.  Evidently Doc spanked them during a time out, because they came back out with focus and pulled comfortably ahead again.  This team just can&#039;t afford to take any time off during a game and expect to maintain the momentum against a feisty Bulls team that was clearly having an off night.

Get &#039;em while they&#039;re down guys!]]></description>
