		<description><![CDATA[Pretty Please Pluck Pittsburgh Pirates Pitcher Prince Paul...Maholm off waivers.

anyway....

I&#039;d love Maholm on my real-life baseball team. He&#039;s a lefty, he&#039;s young, and he&#039;s pretty talented.

But in the fantasy world, I&#039;m not that interested due to his low k-rate. If a pitcher like Randy Johnson or Edinson Volquez struggles, at least they get K&#039;s in a loss. Maholm, if he struggles, will hurt you in ALL categories.

And, K&#039;s are a good indication of the pitcher doing all the work to get the out. I don&#039;t know the specific numbers, but I do know that being a contact pitcher means you need more &quot;good luck&quot; than a strikeout pitcher. 

In most leagues, quality starts don&#039;t count as a single stat. QS&#039;s are a little flawed anyway. I&#039;d much rather have 9 IP, 4 ER, 10 Ks (not a QS) than 6 IP with 3 ER and 3 Ks (a quality start). I know it&#039;s an extreme example, but I&#039;m just sayin.

Either way, I agree Maholm definitely is worth a pick up, just make sure you&#039;re dropping someone like Reed Johnson and not someone like Jonathan Sanchez (high K-rate).]]></description>
