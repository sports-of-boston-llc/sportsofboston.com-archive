		<description><![CDATA[Parks,
I think it&#039;s very tough to look in hindsight and think of what the Pats could have received for Cassel, mostly because it was a much different situation. Cassel was more of a financial move whereas Cutler was a personnel move. I think the Broncos made out very well in the deal, but they also give up a quarterback with a proven track record of skills. Cassel has some doubts as he&#039;s only been a starter for one year, including college. I don&#039;t think Belichick jumped the gun on the trade, it had to get done and it didn&#039;t seem as though there was much of a market out there for Cassel. It was not an option to have both Brady and Cassel&#039;s salaries on the books for 2009. Value is something that is tough to gauge, there was no possible way the Pats could have seen the Cutler trade coming, nor that the Bears would offer such a loaded package of picks.

I think Pats fans just have to realize that the Pats got good value for Cassel given his experience (and salary which is a large part of this equation as not many teams could swallow the $14 million price tag) and made the right valuation the market at that time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jeff,
How would you value the compensation the Pats received for the Cassel/Vrabel trade knowing now what Cutler&#039;s apparent value was on the open market? Do you think Belichick jumped the gun on making the trade with the Chiefs? While I don&#039;t believe at this point in his career Cassel is as good as Cutler, I do feel we could have gotten better value... your take?]]></description>
