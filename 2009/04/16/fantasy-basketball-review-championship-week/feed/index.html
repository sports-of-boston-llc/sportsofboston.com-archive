		<description><![CDATA[Congrats to KC and a major league Homer Simpson &quot;Doh!&quot; to me.

I looked over the numbers I would have amassed by just playing the guys on my bench (and not picking up anyone for Stephen Jackson or Jamal Crawford when they got injured), and I would have been tied for three pointers made. I also would have been only three blocks shy, so I probably would have picked up a shot blocker if I had been paying the correct amount of attention.

I&#039;m pretty much devastated. Oh well. Congrats go to the champion and the Hawks win they win the NBA Finals this year.]]></description>
