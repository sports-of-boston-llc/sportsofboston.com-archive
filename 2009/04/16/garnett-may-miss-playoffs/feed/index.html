		<description><![CDATA[Brutal news indeed.  I&#039;m a little upset that we&#039;ve been teased along on this for many weeks, but I&#039;ll give the staff the benefit of my doubts and assume they just didn&#039;t know how bad it was all along.

One thing for sure is that the Celts are now major underdogs to repeat.  I wish they&#039;d gotten to play the 76ers instead of the Bulls in the first round.  The Bulls are mighty hot, but I&#039;m glad to see the defensive work of Tony Allen (and Leon Powe) is available once again.  That should help a lot.]]></description>
