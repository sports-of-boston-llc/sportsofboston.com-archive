She was so happy to be engaged to Clay and I wish them all the best in their marriage and in their careers.  They both seem to have their heads screwed on straight and in today&#039;s world of sports and media - that is a rare quality.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Look, Clay is a very old friend of mine. I&#039;m sure there hasn&#039;t been a time in some of y&#039;alls lives where you haven&#039;t sucked at your jobs at one point or another. So what if last season wasn&#039;t so great, he&#039;s young and alot of players go their whole lives without making it to &quot;the big show&quot; and he did it at 23! Give him a break! It was his first full season. He&#039;s trying to live up to everyones expectations and I give him major props for that! I wish them nothing but the best!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I should really try to start sucking more at my job too, maybe that is the secret (somehow I doubt it).  Hope she&#039;s at Fenway and on NESN 20 times a game, maybe she can do reporting too!]]></description>
