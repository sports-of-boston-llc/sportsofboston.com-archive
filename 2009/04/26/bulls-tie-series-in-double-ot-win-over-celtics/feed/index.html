		<description><![CDATA[Well, it all looked mighty familiar.  Pierce unable to sink 2 free throws at crunch time. The bench totally useless. Another overtime loss. 

Plus, a complete bonehead play allowing Gordon to take that 3 pointer when all the Celts had to do was foul on the inbound pass to prevent a 2nd overtime.  Just basic stuff here, not rocket science.  So much for veteran smarts.

I think the world of Paul Pierce, but when will somebody tell him to stop driving from outside the 3 point line?  He&#039;s not a good ball handler to begin with, and should be posted up or getting the ball inside the foul line rather than challenging the entire Chicago team as some sort of dribbling expert.  Strip, strip, fumble, strip. I cringe every time he tries that stuff.

The Celts gave that one away.  Looks like another 7 game opening round to me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So much can be said about this game, so I&#039;ll keep it to two comments:

As great as Rondo was, he made two horrible decisions, one at the end of each overtime. He should&#039;ve drove the lane in the first OT and got the ball to Pierce a heck of a lot earlier at the end of the 2nd OT.

As bad as Big Baby was shooting the ball, you just can&#039;t get too mad when the Bulls get some layups at the end of the game when he&#039;s play center at 6&#039;8&quot;. That just goes to the lack of depth.]]></description>
