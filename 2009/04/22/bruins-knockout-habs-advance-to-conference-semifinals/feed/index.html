		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s about damn time! Since the Bruins&#039; last playoff series win in 1999...the Patriots have gone from 5-11 to three-time Super Bowl champions and two coaches (Pete Carroll and Belichick).

The Sox have gone through four managers (Jimy Williams, Joe Kerrigan, Grady Little, Terry Francona) and won two World Series.

The Celtics have gone through four coaches (the nightmare Rick Pitino, Jim O&#039;Brien, John Carroll, and Doc Rivers). They also won their 17th NBA title.

As for the Bruins, they&#039;ve faced disappointment for far too long. I love that they won their first playoff series in a decade by SWEEPING the Canadiens. But, they should&#039;ve done this. They were clearly the superior team all season, dominating the Eastern Conference from start to finish.

They go four lines deep and definitley look poised to push for the Stanley Cup. Hopefully bring on the Rangers!]]></description>
