		<description><![CDATA[Wow!  This series is just brutal.  If the Celtics get out of it alive, they&#039;ll either be worn out for the next round or feel like they&#039;re on vacation - I hope it&#039;s the latter.

The last 6 minutes of regulation were a joy to behold.  Finally foregoing one-on-one basketball, the Celts passed it around like they&#039;ve been doing all season, played stifling defense, and managed to force overtime. Pierce was incredible in those six minutes and in overtime, and Rondo, Perkins and Davis played wonderful games all around.  Probably the best performance I&#039;ve ever seen from Perkins in particular.  And no fouls for Perk!  What a coincidence, after Doc&#039;s outburst.  Hmm.

As for fouls, those ridiculous fouls on Allen are simply incredible.  There&#039;s no equity at all, as Gordon does the very same to Allen and never gets whistled.  How can you not respect a guy like Allen if you&#039;re an official? Fouling out a team&#039;s shooting star at crunch time over pitty pat stuff like this is simply absurd.  Does this ever happen to Lebron or Kobe?  Yuk.]]></description>
