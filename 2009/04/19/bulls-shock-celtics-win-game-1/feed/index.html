		<description><![CDATA[Ken, you&#039;re completely right.

Think of it this way...the Rose, Noah, Thomas, and the Bulls absolutely played out of their mind, and Chicago won by two points in overtime.

The Celtics should be fine as long as they don&#039;t choke...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s only one word to describe this game from the Celtics&#039; point of view - CHOKE.  Ray Allen misses 11 of 12 shots, including a slam dunk attempt, and dribbles the ball off his foot on a fast break.  CHOKE.  Paul Pierce misses a free throw to win the game.  CHOKE.  The entire team looks like idiots chasing around a rookie point guard.  CHOKE.  The bench disappears at crunch time with woeful efforts from Marbury, House and Moore.  CHOKE.  What a sad display this was.

The only bright spots were Rondo - who played his heart out - and Baby, who kept up his recent performance level.  This could be a very quick exit for the Celts if they don&#039;t get their act together right away.]]></description>
