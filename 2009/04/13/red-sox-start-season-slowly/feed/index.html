		<description><![CDATA[Not only is it very early, but we did play two teams who should be in the playoff hunt all season, so it&#039;s not like the Nationals and Indians were knocking the Sox around.  Green has looked good and I was being facetious about Lugo.  I&#039;m not a huge Lowrie fan, I think he&#039;s servicable, but not a long term answer at this point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like your vision in realizing that we&#039;re only 6 games into the season and being in last isn&#039;t anything to be extremely worried about yet.

I still would rather see Lowrie get out of his funk before seeing Julio Boo-go back in the line-up, but Nick Green did play pretty well yesterday.

Hopefully we&#039;ll gain some confidence and knock out a few wins against Oakland this week and get all the kinks out before we come back home.]]></description>
