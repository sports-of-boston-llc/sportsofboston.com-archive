		<description><![CDATA[That was one brutal game to watch, much less play in.  I knew there was a good reason I didn&#039;t want Boston to play Chicago in the first round.  The Bulls have so many offensive weapons it&#039;s scary.  And they&#039;re playing decent defense as well.  I get the feeling they think they can beat the Celts, and from what I&#039;ve seen, it&#039;s no fantasy.  Their bench is much better than Boston&#039;s, they&#039;re playing with real intensity, and they keep you guessing about who&#039;s going to be hot on a particular night.  

If the Celtic bench continues its dismal performance, Chicago is going to wear out the starters.  The Celts would have lost without their dominance on the boards, so that better continue, and KC is dead right that the Celts have to take one of the next 2 games in Chicago to have a chance.  Personally, I think the first away game will be vital to the boys in green.

Great efforts again from Rondo and Baby, great comeback for Ray Allen, and a solid game from Perkins - that&#039;s what it took against Chicago.  Come on bench - these guys need some help!]]></description>
