		<description><![CDATA[Maybe Chicago should just put us out of our misery.  Realistically, how far can the Celts go without the big  bodies underneath? Scal is hardly a star to begin with, and even if he comes back, he&#039;s bound to be rusty and out of shape.

By the way, it was very nice to see that Garnett managed to spend the entire game on the bench, in person, cheering and advising when needed.  It&#039;s about time.  The Celts need all the help they can get.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scal is definitely an improvement over the scraggley Mikki Moore and does have his veteran status under his belt, but not in the post season where he sat last year. 

We now have Perkins, Big Baby, Mikki Moore and Scal. If we had trouble against Chicago with Leon Powe I can imagine how much worse it could get without him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hopefully Scal will be returning in the next couple of days. I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m saying this, but they desperately need his size.

In all seriousness, he&#039;s an intelligent player that isn&#039;t lost defensively, so he&#039;ll be an improvement over Mikki Moore in that regard.]]></description>
