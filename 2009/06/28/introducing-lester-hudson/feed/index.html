		<description><![CDATA[we couldve done a lot worse. dude can score big buckets. only two problems are hes already 24 years old, and he has a classic case of Bill Walker Syndrome, with 27 ACL surgeries on each knee. hopefully he can be as productive in the NBA.....if he sees the court. the 58th pick is a late one, no matter how you look at it.

and haha, Minnesota is the biggest mess of a team i think ive ever seen. Rubio, perhaps the most overrated player in the draft, wasnt enough. they had to go and get two more PGs. Good luck this year. I hear Rubio doesnt like the cold. Make sure when he comes over from spain, his mom remembers to pack his favorite knit hat. we dont want little ricky&#039;s ears getting red.

i cant wait to see what they do with Hudson. or Rondo and Ray for that matter. Just because the draft is over, doesnt mean trade possibilities arent.]]></description>
