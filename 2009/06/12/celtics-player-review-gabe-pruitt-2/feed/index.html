		<description><![CDATA[Pruitt certainly hasn&#039;t gotten a fair shot, and he looks downright timid to me whenever he plays.  I&#039;m reminded, though, of a guy named Joe Johnson who also wasn&#039;t given a fair shot when he was just starting out with the Celts, and who also looked somewhat timid.  Who knows what lies within the heart of a player who isn&#039;t given a real chance to show his stuff?

I think it&#039;s a basic flaw in the Celtic&#039;s system- win all games at all costs and forget about properly developing rookies with meaningful floor time.  Rondo, of necessity, was an exception to that rule, but I fear that last year&#039;s crop of rookies (Giddens and Walker) might well disappear without a real chance, and end up as stars with some other team.

I agree with Geoff - Pruitt will likely be long gone before next season, at least as a Celtic.]]></description>
