		<description><![CDATA[A closer look at McLouth&#039;s numbers won&#039;t have you singing such a joyful tune.

In 2008, McLouth batted .276 with a .291 BABIP. This means he was hitting decently well, but also the balls were falling for him more often than not. So, an element of luck was at hand. 

This season, he is hitting .256 with a .262 BABIP. This means that his pure skill is WORSE than his luck. If the balls are dropping out of luck more often than he is able to hit them, then eventually the luck will run out and his crappy hitting won&#039;t produce a decent batting average.

McLouth&#039;s line drive percentage (LD%) is also down from last season (18.5% to 13.6%) which also leads to decreased BABIP and it explains his inability to hit to the gap and get doubles (46 last season, only 7 this season).

His ground ball percentage (GB%) has spiked significantly from 34.5% to 41.4%. All he is doing is slapping the ball to the infield in most at bats and as evident by the low LD%, he is not making solid contact.

No offesnive help? The Pirates are hitting better as a team (better team batting average) and come on, Jason Bay flourished in Pittsburgh for years with no offensive help as a member of the Pirates.

I think the average will either stay the same or go down, it will not get better and his HR totals will sink in that ballpark. I mean come on, the team leader in HR in Atlanta only has five HR on the year (Yunel Escobat, Kelly Johnson, Brian McCann, and Chipper Jones).

I don&#039;t see Atlanta coveting McLouth&#039;s speed since the Braves only have 12 SB as a team. Clearly Atlanta is not a running team (not that I am trying to tell you how your team does things). Plus, with McLouth batting 3rd, I don&#039;t see him getting a lot of opportunities to run if he isn&#039;t batting leadoff or 2nd. Plus, since his hitting will be poor, he won&#039;t be on the basepaths that much anyway.

So yes Jeff, there is reason to believe that McLouth will do worse in Atlanta.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I disagree. With no offensive help in Pittsburgh pitchers have learned their lesson with McLouth and haven&#039;t given him much to hit. With guys like Brian McCann and Chipper Jones behind him, he&#039;ll get every opportunity to succeed. His speed is something the Braves covet and he&#039;ll be let loose when he gets on the base paths. Not sure if he&#039;ll repeat his &#039;08 numbers, but there&#039;s no reason for him to do worse than he did for the Pirates.]]></description>
