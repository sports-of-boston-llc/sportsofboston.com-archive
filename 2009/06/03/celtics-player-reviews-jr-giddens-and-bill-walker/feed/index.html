		<description><![CDATA[If there&#039;s one thing that bothers me about Doc Rivers it&#039;s his reluctance to find quality time for his rookies unless there&#039;s an emergency situation.  One has to wonder if the somewhat elder statesmen- Garnett, Pierce and Allen -couldn&#039;t have used a lot more time on the bench while the rookies got to play in some minutes other than garbage time. Would Garnett&#039;s body have broken down as badly if he&#039;d been rested while a young guy named Big Baby had a chance to really play in the heart of the season?  Baby proved to be a big surprise when he HAD to play for Garnett.  Is there any reason to believe  (looking back) that the Celts would have collapsed had he played earlier in the season?  

Would Pierce have been so worn out if he&#039;d had a chance to rest while Walker was given meaningful time?  Even if it had cost the Celts 4 or 5 games, so what? The experience might have shown that Walker had the goods to play a lot more often.

In short, I wish Doc would give his youngsters some real playing time.  I see other teams taking those sorts of chances, and in many cases there have proven to be rookies who became big surprise stories simply because they had a chance to play.]]></description>
