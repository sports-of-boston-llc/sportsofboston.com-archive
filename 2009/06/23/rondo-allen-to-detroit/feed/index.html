		<description><![CDATA[Well Ken, think about it. After this season Ray will be 35 years old. For one he is not going to take the veteran minimum to play, so it&#039;d cost a pretty penny. Secondly, his play will decrease and after next year, what will he have left? 2 years TOPS? 

It just doesn&#039;t make sense to keep a 35 year old shooter on the team, to be honest.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why is everyone so certain that Ray Allen is leaving after this season?  Has he said so?  Am I missing something here?

As for trading Rondo, I can&#039;t even believe it&#039;s being considered. I hope Ainge isn&#039;t lying about this when he denies the rumors.  Why would you trade a proven, young point guard who will be among the league&#039;s elite if he can keep improving his jump shot, for an untried rookie or a second level  (at best) replacement point guard?  Is Rondo that big an ass in the locker room?  Please tell me it&#039;s all just a lot of off season rumor peddling.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You said it yourself, &quot;one of the best point guards in the NBA.&quot;  I rate Hamilton and Prince pretty highly, but I hate the thought of Rondo hitting his full potential in somebody else&#039;s uniform.]]></description>
