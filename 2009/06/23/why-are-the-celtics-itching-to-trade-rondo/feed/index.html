		<description><![CDATA[thats true, as long as everyone is happy, it will all work out. The thing about Wade is that he will cost some serious money as well. I know you have to pay the big bucks to get prime talent, but we also dont want the same cap problems we have now while trying to get rid of rays expiring contract, and Rondo before he demands a thicker contract. It will be tough to afford the likes of Pierce, KG, and D-Wade. We cant forget that Glenn Davis has a contract thats running thin as well. BUT, if they can make it work, and the team plays well together, Im all for it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well Ray is leaving after 2009-2010 anyway, so I&#039;m sure Pierce and KG would have no issue taking a back seat to Wade if it meant a title or two. Plus, those two aren&#039;t getting any younger, and KG&#039;s knees might never be the same after all the mileage he&#039;s put on them in his career.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of course D-wade doesnt have a team to back him up, I completely understand. All Im saying is that not everyobdy in the NBA has the &quot;what&#039;s best for the team&quot; mentality. KG, Ray, and Pierce are all proven leaders, and they have all been on teams deemed worthless because they are the only stars on them. Luckily, they collaborate very well together. Im not saying D-Wade is a bad idea, Im just saying we should consider the slight chance of an epic fail in terms of collaboration. Too many leaders on a team isnt always a good thing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On the topic of D-Wade... of course he&#039;s been putting up 30 a game... have you seen who he plays with? Who else is gonna score for them? Washed up Jermaine O&#039;Neal? Mario Chalmers? Daequan Cook?? I&#039;d think he&#039;d fit in well in Boston since Pierce has proved he doesn&#039;t mind sharing the ball in crunch time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Matty, I&#039;m definitely intrigued by the Stoudemire possibility.. Amare is a train-wreck on defense but he&#039;s a freak athletically and has the ability to turn into a good shot-blocker if he works with Perkins and KG. Can you imagine those 3 in the front court at 6&#039;10 and above?

As for the Pistons offer... It could work or fail depending on how good Rodney Stuckey really is. he&#039;s shown flashes like his 40 point game last season but he also slumped badly for a while. Since Ray isn&#039;t coming back after next year, I think Hamilton could be a good replacement and Prince certainly fits the James Posey defensive stopper role. 

Tyreke Evans could be a big-time player, but the Celtics would have to be in love with him to make that deal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[awesome article man. some imput, if i may:

rondo for amare isnt happening.
the sacremento option is interesting, but i have to agree with you, I just cant see them getting rid of talent they already know they have for (and ONLY for) a rookie who could prove to be a bust.

honestly, im a little surprised that Detroit has &quot;laughed&quot; at the current offer. im no history major, but if we look at the recent years, what has Detroit accomplished? Anybody? Yea, I didnt think you guys could come up with anything either. Their whole team is old. Rasheed Wallace is balding. Teyshaun Prince looks like hes falling asleep on the bench half of the time. Rip doesnt wear that mask for luck, its because he needs it to hold his face together. and perhaps one of their best young players in stuckey, has proven to be quite inconsistent. Allen would provide some increased 3 point goals. when sheed is attempting more 3s than some of your guards, something needs to change. and rondo is just rondo. plus, those three players in rip, prince, and stuckey, im sure are consuming a decent combined pay. moving them out might not be such a bad idea. it wouldnt hurt us either. if Rondo is as bad as the rumours imply, who needs that? It could be worse than a former all-star and leading assist man in starbury leading our team next season. much worse. have you seen the crop of PGs lately? Rick Rubio is the best one in the draft this year. yikes.

Signing D-Wade, now theres an intersting idea. It would be awesome, i agree with the comment above, but would it really work? you dont average 30-something points a game by giving everyone else their fair share of shots. he has molded himself into a leading, but dare i say selfish, scorer on a repeatedly failing team. Would he really be able to fit into a team that is designed on the word &quot;team&quot; rather than &quot;player&quot;? I guess time will tell. but if Detroit is so arrogently rejecting offers that are clearly no joke, i hope they crumble just as they have so many times in recent years. Go celtics. I trust ainge to make it happen.]]></description>
