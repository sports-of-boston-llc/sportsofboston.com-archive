		<description><![CDATA[Managers get paid to do a lot of things, like manage 25 players. Francona kept getting paid when Manny decided he didn&#039;t want to play, when Nomar decided he didn&#039;t want to play then when they felt like playing Francona let them play. Does that make Francona a bad manager? No, he did what he felt was best for his team, in that case it was ignoring moody star players antics. In Girardi&#039;s case, he trusted arod was telling him the truth. The Yankees upper brass doesn&#039;t have to worry about keeping the players trust, so that&#039;s why they basically put Arod in a corner by bringing him in for a conference call with the medical staff on the line to try to prove that he was in playing shape.]]></description>

I appreciate your point, but I still think that it speaks volumes that Yankee management felt they had to step in.  Girardi &quot;wasn&#039;t available?&quot;  Isn&#039;t this the kind of moment that managers get paid for?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t mind a comparison of the two organizations, IF the facts are straight. Jon Heyman a critically acclaimed writer for Sports Illustrated did just that. Here is what he reported.
• Alex Rodriguez&#039;s two days of rest was instigated by the front office, as was reported first here. But it shouldn&#039;t necessarily be taken as a slap at manager Joe Girardi. A-Rod just couldn&#039;t bring himself to admit he was wearing down whenever Girardi checked with him. So Yankees higher-ups Brian Cashman and Randy Levine engaged A-Rod and Yankees medical staff on a conference call (Girardi wasn&#039;t available at that moment), and Rodriguez finally admitted he was tiring to the point where he wasn&#039;t himself. Rodriguez&#039;s refusal to give Girardi the straight dope isn&#039;t a reflection on Girardi but the natural course for players who don&#039;t like to sit. So the decision was made on the conference call.]]></description>
