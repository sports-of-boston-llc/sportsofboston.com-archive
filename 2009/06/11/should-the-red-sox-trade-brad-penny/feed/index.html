		<description><![CDATA[All I&#039;ll say is, I completely agree regarding our pal Buckaroo. He is still unproven in my mind, and until he shows us otherwise, I&#039;ll continue to think that he&#039;s a bit of a headcase. Yes, on the whole, more than solid this year in Pawtucket. But just looking at Pawtucket&#039;s team on the whole tells you that AAA isnt the bigs. Great potential. We&#039;ll see how he transitions this time. I wouldnt mind seeing a trade that includes him though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dice-K is staying here, everyone talking about trying to trade him is ludicrous.  Even if we did, we would not get much for him because (at least i think) he has a long contract that while not expensive isn&#039;t exactly cheap either.  However the most important thing is that Dice-K has WAY more upside than Penny...I mean come on, Penny is probably pitching the best he can right now.  Dice-K has 2 years of experience in the majors and is still learning, and i think will continue to do so.  And about the walks, through his first 6 starts, he has 6 less walks this year than he did last year.  Baseball, more than any other sport, is a game of patience.  I say just give it time.
Same goes for Buchholz.  I personally think all of these head issues people talk of is a cop out.  Buchholz, like Dice-K, had trouble figuring things out last year.  It is very, very common for young pitchers to struggle early in their career.  Buchholz is a  young pitcher with a good deal of upside, which is the most valuable thing in all of baseball.  You just do not trade young starting pitching, it is way too valuable.]]></description>
