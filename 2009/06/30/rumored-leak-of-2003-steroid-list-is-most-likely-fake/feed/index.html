		<description><![CDATA[The reason most people are defensive of Pujols is because he isn&#039;t just another player.  I&#039;m not referring to his statistics which speak for themselves, but rather his humble demeanor, charitable works, and class; all of which are sorely lacking in so many professional athletes.  Those attributes are also why most people accept that he chose not to juice up.  Also, you might notice that there are entire teams missing from the list; possible due to something known as institutional control.  In other words, players realize that the fan base and management at various locations do not accept cheating, even if it means added performance and more wins.  This is why Mark McGuire seldom makes appearances at St.Louis; the response to him is tepid at best.  It really comes down to character; what a person does when no one is looking. (Like corking a bat.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hamza, 

Please learn some basic writing skills before you start a rant.

From what I interpreted from your semi-English and gramatically-raped argument, you are telling me to lay off of steroid users.

No way. It comes down to the basic fact that when you use steroids or other PED&#039;s, you are trying to gain an unfair advantage over those who are trying to play the game the old-fashioned, clean way. Would you approve of stealing signals from opposing teams or would you approve of scuffing the ball if you were a pitcher? No, you wouldn&#039;t. So any form of cheating is unacceptable.

Most players that do get caught for testing positive always come out and admit their wrongdoings. Why? Because they know that what they did was wrong!

Like most journalists and broadcasters who agree with my side of the steroid issue (aka, the majority), they too have never played the game of baseball. So yes, while it is true that I have never played baseball at a competitive level, it does not change the fact that the use of PED&#039;s is a slap in the face to the game.

Ballplayers are not people like you and me. I don&#039;t make millions of dollars a year (and never will). Hell, as I said before, even the worst player makes the league-minimum of $390,000 (and that was 2008, it is probably around $400,000 now). These guys are public figures and are aware of the consequences of being in the public eye. They know that we are scrutinizing every move they make and if they are stupid enough to dabble in illegal subtances, then they should know the repercussions. 

I am sorry to argue with a member of the University of Toronto baseball team, the same team that I believe finished 8-10 last season. I could make the argument that since no noteworthy baseball players have ever emerged from the University of Toronoto, that you don&#039;t have the right to make an argument about anything baseball-related as well. The most famous athletes to come from University of Toronto are hockey players (Conn Smythe, Stan Brown, Joseph Sullivan), so maybe baseball is not the best career path for you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why is everyone so defensive of Pujols? He is just another player. I have an opinion, and I am expressing it.

My suspicion doesn&#039;t end with Pujols, I don&#039;t trust any player. Everyone is guilty until proven innocent. 

I also said:

&quot;Those wishing for Ortiz to get busted are glad to see his name here&quot;

Where were Papi&#039;s defenders when I wrote that line? Nobody cared. Then, as it turns out, he actually was guilty.

Journalists, bloggers, broadcasters, and fans speculate everyday about what player might have been taking PED&#039;s. I am no different. I am sorry if you don&#039;t like my opinion, but too bad.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The whole steroid situation boggles my mind.  We know that steroids can shorten a life (Lyle Alzado and others).  We do not know the potential damage from other PEDs, if any.  Most of the major sports organizations have taken steps to curb their use during the 80&#039;s and 90&#039;s with the exception of MLB, which finally acted in 2004.  But the demonstration of lack of ethics and morals that has been demonstrated is symtomatic of our society today.  MLB&#039;s fear of a strike is not justification for not acting to protect the health of their employees, an ethical and moral failure.  The athletes that used the PEDs dispite knowledge that the other sports organizations were banning them are morally and ethically bankrupt.  The agent of the court that is releasing names of PED users despite the judges order to seal the file is ethically and morally corrupt.  Reporters printing the information released by the agent of the court are just as ethically and morally corrupt.  It is not much different than bankers giving people mortages that they can not afford.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cheating is cheating is cheating.  Pete&#039;s right.  Also, I worked in newspapers for a little while, and it sure as hell doesn&#039;t make me the New York Times.

We&#039;re here talking about sports.  Whether one overpaid butthead took dangerous performance-enhancing drugs is not particularly important, nor is it what&#039;s really at issue in arguments like these.

It&#039;s about world-view.  Do I know better?  Is my morality the correct one?  Should steroids be legal?  If I think they should be, but they&#039;re still not, should players who take them be subject to stricture?

Like I said, I think that if you don&#039;t like the rules, that&#039;s your business.  But cheating is still cheating.

Also, Pete, if you really are begging for David Ortiz to go down in flames, there&#039;s going to be some serious SportsofBoston drama!  Sports nerd fight!  Oi oi oi!]]></description>
