		<description><![CDATA[I think Pruitt is too young to give up on, he&#039;s got some talent and the potenial to at least be a reserve.  That said, I think the C&#039;s should avoid playing Rondo to death by filling in with a combo of House, Daniels and try to ease in Pruitt.  If it doesn&#039;t work out, then go after a crusty old vet.  Unless they can find a way to bring a Tyronn Lou here for cheap dollars, then they should hold off until the deadline.  I truly believe Pruitt hasn&#039;t had a chance to shine yet, but (not to disrespect all you bloggers) I trust all Boston sports organizations (even the Bruins now) to know they will end up making the right decision.  I just like to get an early jump on what that decision will be.]]></description>
