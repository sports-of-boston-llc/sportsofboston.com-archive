		<description><![CDATA[I think this is awesome.  This is a unique chapter in a great rivalry, I hope they make this a tradition, even if it isn&#039;t annual.

I think the NHL missed a bit on the B&#039;s opponent: Montreal?  Pittsburgh (Crosby), Rangers?  Philly with no marquee player and no real rivalry (the one 30 years ago sorta died), but this would be a home run.]]></description>
