		<description><![CDATA[I agree, he has definitely not lived up to the hype, but part of what the Red Sox paid for was hype to translate it into marketing in Japan.  I&#039;ve heard that more Red Sox games are seen than any other team.  Dice-K&#039;s signing has led to Okajima&#039;s, Saito&#039;s, and Tazawa&#039;s on some level.  The biggest reason he hasn&#039;t converted well is that they go deep into games with unreal pitch counts (140-160 without an issue), so they&#039;re shelf life is shorter and is it a coincidence that his shoulder is tired?  Or, that every outing is 5 innings and right around 100 pitches?  I don&#039;t know if there is a bigger strike zone in Japan, but he doesn&#039;t attack hitters here, he is definitely trying to nibble and walking a lot of guys (and leading to the pitch count issues) here.  He frustrates the heck out of me, but with the marketing backdrop and (at the time at least) talk of a &quot;NESN&quot; launch in Japan, it was worth it for that 2007 season :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As Mr. Phelps pointed out we all remember the hype that preceded Dice-K&#039;s arrival in Boston and we wondered if he could live up to the hype.  Perhaps it was unfair to put so much hope into one player&#039;s arm, but Sox fans have come to expect a lot in recent years.   Only time will tell if D-K&#039;s arm can even what it was two years ago.]]></description>
