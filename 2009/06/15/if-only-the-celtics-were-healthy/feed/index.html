Pau Gasol: 28
Lamar Odom: 29
Kobe Bryant: 30
Derek Fisher: 34
Andrew Bynum: 21
.....
Paul Pierce: 31
Kevin Garnett: 33
Ray Allen: 33
Kendrick Perkins: 24
Rajon Rondo: 23


So I guess Rondo and Perk don&#039;t count as Celtics?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve got to agree with KC&#039;s frustration.  I watched all of the games between Cleveland and the Magic, as well as most of the games between the Lakers and Denver, and I got more and more bitter as each series progressed.  There&#039;s no doubt in my mind that the Celts were better - at full strength - than any of those teams.

I suppose it could be argued that the Magic also lost a key player  (Jameer Nelson) earlier in the year at point guard, and his return may have hurt them more than helped them against the Lakers (why oh why was Anthony Johnson given absolutely no playing time when the other two guards were shooting bricks?), but you can&#039;t compare that to the loss of Garnett and Powe at the very end of the season.

The Lakers didn&#039;t win as much as the Magic lost.  Bonehead plays (allowing that 3 pointer to be shot at the end of game 4), cold shooting from 3 point range, missed free throws at critical times, and a truly uninspiring performance from Howard....well, the Lakers were in the right place at the right time.  I think the Celts would have smashed them again.

Sour grapes, I guess.  L.A. taking another one makes the grapes very sour indeed.

One more comment - If I have to listen to Mark Jackson say &quot;Momma, here comes that man again&quot;  or &quot;Not in my house&quot;  one more time, I may have to give up watching basketball.]]></description>
