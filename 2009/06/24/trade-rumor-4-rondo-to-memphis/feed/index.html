		<description><![CDATA[This trade is actually an upgrade talent-wise, but don&#039;t underestimate Rondo&#039;s D in the championship run.  I&#039;m not sure Conley&#039;s upgrade in offense is needed or strengthens the team for that matter.  However, if Rondo is the mess Ainge made him out to be (and you HAVE to deal him), take a deal like this and cut your losses before you&#039;ve undercut his value too much.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[this is probably the best deal I&#039;ve seen for Rondo. Gay is the man. Conley is shaping up to be somebody really, really good, especially on the offensive end. Not only that, but in this trade, Ray isnt involved. This means we can send him out as well, for maybe a decent draft pick, or perhaps even keep him until his contract is up. I know it hurts you, matt, to see Bill Walker lose potential for more court time, but if its between Bill Walker, or Rudy Gay and Mike Conley.......put 2 and 2 together, dude.]]></description>
