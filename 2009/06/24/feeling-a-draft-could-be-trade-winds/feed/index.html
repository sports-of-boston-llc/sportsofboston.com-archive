		<description><![CDATA[Nice article by Brian.  In the end, it all boils down to money.  How sad that professional sports have deteriorated to the point that the concept of &quot;team&quot; has to take second place to the reality of salary caps and such.  It&#039;s really asking a lot to expect fans to be loyal to a team when players are merely chess pieces that are moved around for little more than moneteray reasons.  Such is our desperation for something to root for in this bizarre world that we&#039;re willing to accept such foolishness and still stick with our sacred Celtics or Bruins, or whichever team we&#039;ve always loved.  It&#039;s hard to find fault with players who leave teams for more bucks elsewhere when this state of modern sports almost demands it.

I can remember an interview with Larry Bird as he got just a little bit older but was still a major star, where he stated that if the Celtics traded him, he&#039;d retire before going elsewhere.  He was a Celtic, period.  It&#039;s hard to imagine any basketball player saying the same thing today.  Forgive my &quot;good ol&#039; days&quot; longings, but I wish it were as it used to be.

I&#039;ll be saddened and disgusted if Rondo is traded away for salary cap considerations.]]></description>
