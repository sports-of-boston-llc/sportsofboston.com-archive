		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, Stallworth did not pay off the judge haha, but the family also didn&#039;t pursue a separate lawsuit because of the settlement (what does that say about the family?).

The minimum for vehicular homicide in Florida is 10 years without a plea deal (if the prosecution proved Donte did something to cause the accident, like fail to hit the brakes or something else)...so everyone should be mad.

Moving the details aside (though what is a pedestrian doing on a highway)...Stallworth killed someone and was driving drunk behind the wheel. A man&#039;s life was lost and Stallworth was driving drunk....but only serves 30 days in jail.

Sure, he&#039;ll have to live with it the rest of his life, but he killed a human being and is only serving 30 days in prison. What kind of precedence does it set? 

I suppose if you have a lot of money and mutilate dogs (Mike Vick), it&#039;s one thing. You&#039;ll be sentenced to 2 yrs in prison and bankrupted, despite cooperating all along with authorities.

In Stallworth&#039;s case, he recklessly killed a man (a human, not a dog), while accidental, and will serve 30 days in jail plus many years on probation.

So, if you&#039;re rich (to pay off the family) and cooperate with police, you can get off pretty light for killing another human being.

Now, I wonder if Roger Goodell will suspend him for at least one year (maybe two). Does his prison sentence affect Goodell&#039;s planned punishment? We will see...]]></description>
