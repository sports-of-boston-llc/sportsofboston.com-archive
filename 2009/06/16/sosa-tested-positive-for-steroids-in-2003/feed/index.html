Sosa was a third OF before the juice, and a legend with it. He was manufactured (like Palmiero) by steroids. If I had a vote, no way would I put him in...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Definitely a no-brainer here. Hey that corked bat was just for BP I swear....

Clearly the cork wasn&#039;t enough for Sosa, he needed the extra juice to compete...what a fraud and such a fan favorite. When is his public apology coming? Is he going to blame it on that &quot;loosey-goosey era&quot; like Arod?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not that unexpected, but another superstar who won&#039;t be in the Hall of Fame...very sad times for baseball, but the drug testing program is the way to go and these incidents keep proving that it works.  Anyone think he&#039;ll get called back in front of Congress?  He essentially perjured himself after all and you know how they love to get on TV!]]></description>
