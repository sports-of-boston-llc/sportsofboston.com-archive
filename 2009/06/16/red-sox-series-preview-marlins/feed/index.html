		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d love to see Hanley back in the Sox uniform, but I don&#039;t think we&#039;ll be seeing it anytime soon.

KC has a point about the WS wins, but come on...wouldn&#039;t you rather have the top fantasy guy on your team rather than a WS ring?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would have loved that infield, but getting Beckett AND Lowell (who the Marlins just threw in for financial reasons) was an absolute steal.  I would do that deal again, but hopefully, we can get him back in the future :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What an absurd comment! Never in a million years do you sacrifice the chance at a World Series win. I wouldn&#039;t trade winning the WS for any prospect in any circumstance. 

Anyway, the Marlins won&#039;t be able to afford him and you may get your homegrown infield with Hanley included when we buy him/trade for him.

My guess is that by the time he gets a new contract, he&#039;ll be moved to the outfield anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll be seeing Hanley live on Thursday (weather permitting).

With all the SS problems we have now, the Hanley deal isn&#039;t looking too well. 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, we won a World Series because of the contributions of Beckett and Lowell, but come on, wouldn&#039;t you love to see Hanley playing next to Pedroia, Youkilis, and (eventually) Lars Anderson? What a homegrown infield that would have been.]]></description>
