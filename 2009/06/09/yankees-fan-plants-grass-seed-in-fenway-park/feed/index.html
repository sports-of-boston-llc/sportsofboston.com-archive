		<description><![CDATA[NY fans would buy sacks of dog crap if they had &quot;Yankees&quot; printed on the side. Oh no, you planted some grass that was the same type that they used at the new Yankees Stadium... I&#039;m gonna capture a jar of air at Fenway and they release it at YS, then Derek Jeter will be breathing Fenway Air! MUAhahaha.

Ian is just making the universe greener one piece of grass at a time.  

Ian is a hero!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[...] Apparently this guy planted some Yankee grass seed at Fenway park at the Phish concert this past wee... Again, how many times can I say that the Steinbrenners are the best owners in baseball?!?!? Why let a bunch of weed smoking crack pots on the grass in the stadium where your team plays? Nothing good can come of it! Nothing! Not even the Pope himself was allowed to touch the grass at Yankee Stadium last year and we&#8217;re going to let a bunch of Phish fans on the grass? Not gonna happen. This is what happens when you run your team like a business. John Henry saw that he could make some extra cash and it got him one thing, cursed. Ian Ferris, a manager at a local Hooters in Vermont, came into town with a bag of Yankee grass seed, snuck it into the concert like someone right out of Ocean&#8217;s 13 and planted the grass on the infield of Fenway Park. The Curse Of Ian Ferris has been born and Boston will go into another championship slumber for 86 years. [...]]]></description>
