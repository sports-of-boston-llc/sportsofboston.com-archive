		<description><![CDATA[Colby Cage...perfect game or no perfect game...I&#039;m goin&#039; with the name...most excellent!!!...if you plan to be a baseball player when you grow up...and out of Little League AND in the bigs...pick a name like Colby Cage.

Now...keep track...with some luck he hits a home run and pitches another perfect game in the LL World Series...then goes on to college hockey to win the Hobie Baker Award...hmmm, have we heard this story before...

Best of good fortune and hats off to Colby...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Congradulations Colby!
You&#039;ve done something that &quot;professional ballplayers&quot; can only dream of doing.   What makes this story great other than your ability, is you are playing a game for the love of it, and have succeeded.  

Best Wishes!
