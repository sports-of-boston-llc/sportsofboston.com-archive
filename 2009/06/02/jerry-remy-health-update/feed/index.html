		<description><![CDATA[Jerry, As colorful as Eck is and I do enjoy his visits, there is no one like you and Don doing the game. 
  You are the voice of the game and I&#039;m so glad that you are feeling better and coming back soon.
  You were missed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jerry; You probably will not see this. I now live in California for five years. I moved from Conn. and bought the basball sport package to watch the Red Sox&#039;s. Dennis Eckersley (sp) is doing a good job but I miss you. I think you do a relatively unbiased (as you can be)job of the game. Good luck with the treatments. Looking forward to seeing back on T.V. Regards Richard Schuman]]></description>
