		<description><![CDATA[For once I agree with a redsox fan... to a point. I would have liked to hear your interpretation of the steroid scandal when arod was crying in front of the cameras and the sporting world still railed him unmercifully. I always thought it was peculiar that no redsox players were mentioned, when all other teams were represented by steroid cheaters. Now that 2 redsockers have come out of the closet in the past few weeks, no one should care?
OK I won&#039;t anymore but now you gotta leave arod alone. Because it is none of your business right??]]></description>
