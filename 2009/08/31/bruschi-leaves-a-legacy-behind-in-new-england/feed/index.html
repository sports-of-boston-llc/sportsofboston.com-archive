		<description><![CDATA[Tedy will be sadly missed by all us devote Patriots fans. He was not only an inspiration to his team but, to all of us. It didn&#039;t matter if we were losing 28-0 Tedy still kept up moral and made us all beleive we could still win. This guy deserves respect. If anyone should be tributed by having their # retired it&#039;s him. We will miss you #54 and your charisma, brains and talent and most of all heart.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am not as moved by his contributions on the field as I am by his contributions off the field and what kind of role model he is for his kids, the fans and players coming up in the NFL.  Imagine, a guy not chasing the money, but chasing the dream with ONE team.  Doesn&#039;t happen much in this day and age.  A true gentlemen of the game!!

We paid tribute to the man on this week&#039;s episode of the Wicked Pissa Dude Podcast, you can listen at http://www.wickedpissadude.com.]]></description>
