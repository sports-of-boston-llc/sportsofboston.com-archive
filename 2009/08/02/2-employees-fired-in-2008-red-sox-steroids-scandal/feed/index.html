		<description><![CDATA[Selig definitely enjoyed the money...but the Players Union (specifically Donald Fehr and others) may be most to blame. The players stood to make a ton of money too, and better stats meant more money in a fattening baseball economy.

As far as the steroids mess goes...the MLB really showed how not to handle it. They screwed up most steps of the way, and had they hit the problem head on at first, we wouldn&#039;t be in this position. But, it all goes back to Selig needed to cut a deal to save baseball from a strike, which means the Players Union needs to be appeased. Give me a break.

As far as it baseball being tarnished by steroid use? You bet it is. But, I really think when they finally release the full list, we might be able to close one of the darkest chapters in baseball history.

What I don&#039;t understand is why other sports get a free pass with drug/steroids use? Will Rodney Harrison make the Hall of Fame? You bethca...despite the HGH connection. Will Shawne Merriman be seen as a feared defensive presence once again, assuming he plays? Yes, despite his own steroid use. HGH use is rampant in football I bet...but the issue isn&#039;t even broached.

Random side note: Despite the Globe making no real mention to it...Jared Remy happens to be Jerry Remy&#039;s son, according to reports.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[More positive press for Boston sports. 

Seriously, when is it all going to stop? America&#039;s pasttime has become a walking joke. You literally can&#039;t trust one single player. The steroid problem is crippling a once great sport and as far as we know, the problem won&#039;t ever go away. Every home run hit will be scrutinized and no record will be trusted.

I am getting to a point where I don&#039;t want to watch the game anymore. What&#039;s the point in watching a game full of cheaters and drug abusers?

I am sick to my stomach.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;This one makes you harder&quot; Remy recalled. What? Are they giving baseball players...Viagra?

On a more serious note, there&#039;s so much going on, it&#039;s going to be very difficult for the outsiders to piece this thing together. Especially since we have, I-want-steroids-in-MLB-Selig at the helm. Too many coverups and too many missed penalties/explanations for inaction.

All roads lead to money. I think the theory that baseball was losing its luster and steroids/more home runs brought the fans back into the game is increasingly gaining more merit in my book. It would also explain why the PED-rules were so lax, i.e. non-existent (and also why most of the penalties have been non-existent). Selig and MLB corporate should just own up to the the truth; the fans will respect the sport more, rather than it be shrouded in doubt and accusations like it is now.]]></description>
