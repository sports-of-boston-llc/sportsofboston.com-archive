		<description><![CDATA[Hey YO! I believe that Pierce is an amazing player but that he&#039;s not mentioned as much as all those weird Baseball Players. Though I love Baseball!! =)I think this might be because its not Bball season yet. Anyway! PAUL RULES EVERYWHERE !!! My 6 brothers absolutly love him and my five sisters think he&#039;s pretty good.. though only two of them actually follow the Bball season. Though All my sis&#039;s play BBall.. Even Kailie.... who&#039;s 7! Rosaley is the best of them all though. But Kristina and Olivia are good too. Anna and Chloe and good too I guess. My brothers are good too. There&#039;s James, Jake and Jack, Nathan, Martin, and Danny, who&#039;s twins with Kailie( so are Jake and Jack). Alicia is my cousin and she is amazing too! I hope Pierce gets voted MVP soon!!! ROCK ON DUDE --- Johnny-JJ Pierce FAN]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Please excuse I need to vent. I wish there was a stat on players that take charges. I&#039;ve been watching the celtics like forever and i have never seen an ALL Star caliber player take so many charges. There legit charges also not flops. This man has been accussed of being a so so defender until the last couple years and i find that to be off base. This man is TOUGH, tough and tough. Cripe hate to re-live it but the man was stabbed up teen times and stayed a Celtic. Good Call SHAQ -- 
PIERCE IS THE TRUE MEANING OF THE &quot; TRUTH &quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pierce is truly the heart and soul of the team.  I remember when he was in his second year and Tommy Heinsohn said that if he avoided injury, he&#039;d eventually break most of the Celtic scoring records.  Everybody laughed, but Tommy gets the last laugh on this one.
 Pierce never got the credit he was due because the Celts were so awful before the big three came into existence; but finally, everyone realizes just how good he is.  Not the NBA&#039;s best, by any means, but certainly in the top echelon.  If he had the dribbling skills of former teammate Antoine Walker, he&#039;d be unstoppable.  

His number should definitely be the next retired, up in the rafters, when his playing days are over.]]></description>
