		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t understand what all the hoopla is about. I mean really I understand he was aware of dogs that were being killed. I got all of that, BUT he served his time, now let&#039;s let the man earn a living! I mean honestly people want him banished from the NFL and society forever because he was aware of dogs being killed. But a person like Donte Stallworth ,can kill a man - get 24 days in jail and not be scrutizined from the public. What is really going on with the world. Since when did the life of an animal trump that of a human being!!!!??]]></description>
