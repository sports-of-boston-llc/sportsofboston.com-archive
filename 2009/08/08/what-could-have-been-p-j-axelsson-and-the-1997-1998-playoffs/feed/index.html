		<description><![CDATA[I was one of those 15,000 in the crowd that thought that was it. Only 10 or 11 at the time but enthralled. 13 years later I&#039;m a season ticket holder and game 4 sure felt a LOT like this game. Good to see the B&#039;s coming out on top though. 

I still have a gripe against washington to this day. Not that any caps fans today would remember this..the caps never existed before ovechkin :P]]></description>
