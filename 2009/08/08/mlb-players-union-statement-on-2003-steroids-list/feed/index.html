		<description><![CDATA[This is all bullshit. Why is MLB and the Player&#039;s Union now saying something? Where were they for Sosa and A-Rod?

They had their chance to make this statement months ago and they screwed up. Now wverything they are doing is just damage control.

Names and legacies have already been tarnished. The league has no choice now but to just release all the names on the list and what each player tested positive for. Rip it off like a band-aid and just get it over with. Let the storm hit all at once and then it will pass. Stop dragging this out!!!]]></description>
