		<description><![CDATA[If your a celtics fan you should be upbeat by what the GM has done. The Celtics main concern is easily identifiably the back up point guard slot. My question out there to celtics nation would be , do you go out there and sign a back up point now or do you wait it out and see what you can do with your expiring contracts ( T.Allen , Scal )?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The scoop is that KG has violated the NBA&#039;s media relations policy. Under NBA rules a player cannot refuse to speak to the media for more than 60 days. No one has heard a word out of KG in over 90. I suspect we&#039;ll hear something soon, but the whole situation is a bit suspect. I&#039;m glad Davis is back. I don&#039;t trust the health of KG or Rasheed, they&#039;re both in the top 20 for most games played by active NBA players.]]></description>
