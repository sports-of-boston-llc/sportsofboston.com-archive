		<description><![CDATA[Just one guy&#039;s opinion, but I admittedly was a regular listener of WEEI - mostly because it was the only (sports) game in town (I was never into national radio with ESPN, and I admit I didn&#039;t even know &quot;The Zone&quot; still existed - the one or two times I tuned in they had devolved to syndicated shows). 

While few would argue that Dennis and Callahan is more of a right-wing rant than sports program, worse than that it is most often just plain NEGATIVE and filled with bile (maybe that comes with the right-wing political territory, I don&#039;t know). That said, when I discovered Toucher and Rich my mornings simply got better. Much better. Not only are they funny, I was amazed to find they are HYSTERICALLY funny - and refreshing, and self-deprecating. For the first time in ages, I&#039;m laughing out loud during my morning drive, and actually feeling GOOD while getting my Pats and Sox fix. They may not be mensa-level sports historians, but who cares? Neither are D&#038;C. They know enough, though, to create a wonderfully entertaining, laugh-out-loud morning show that still keeps a fine onus on sports. I&#039;ll never go back to WEEI during the morning hours.

As for Dale and Holley, they&#039;re both decent enough guys, I&#039;m sure, but I think anyone objective on the subject would agree it certainly isn&#039;t the most compelling four hours of radio (if anything, Holley&#039;s imagined hipness and ego can get grating). It IS subjective, but I definitely prefer Tanguay&#039;s personality.

For me, it just leaves the 2pm - 6pm slot, and I will check in during those hours over Felger - but only if The Big O is there. He&#039;s really the only reason I&#039;d tune back in to WEEI.

Just one guy&#039;s opinion, but I have to think there are many out there who quietly have shown agreement, simply by tuning in with 98.5 during the morning and afternoon hours. I think many will be surprised when the ratings finally are released. I have a feeling WEEI - for the first time in its sports broadcasting history - has some seriously formidable competition at hand.

Whatever the case, thank God for REAL choice now...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mick - Where do I disrespect the Sports Hub? It&#039;s obvious WEEI felt threatened because the Sports Hub is legit, that&#039;s why they put Sox games on WEEI permanently.

It definitely wont be &quot;The Zone&quot; or ESPN 890 for that matter (I barely listened to either of them anyway).

The Sports Hub definitely has a shot...I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll dethrone WEEI, but it is definitely going to steal listeners. I&#039;ve listened to WEEI for years now...and it does not suck. It&#039;s only the highest rated sports radio station in the ENTIRE COUNTRY!

Toucher and Rich, while funny, have no business on a sports radio morning show. I think Zolak and Tanguay are decent competition to Dale and Holley. Felger and Mazz are good competition to the Big Show (I find myself switching back and forth). Damon Amandalara at night is way more informed about sports than Mike Adams. Did I suck up enough to 98.5 yet??

What&#039;s the matter with me? Nothing. You? Well...to be honest I think you work there, in all seriousness. End of story.]]></description>

KC, you want to give the new station a little more credit? 

It&#039;s doing just fine and is NOT, I repeat NOT going to be another &quot;Zone&quot;. 

What&#039;s the matter with you, in all seriousness? 

The Hub still has a shot and WEEI sucks. End of story. 

98.5&#039;s not going anywhere anytime soon.]]></description>
