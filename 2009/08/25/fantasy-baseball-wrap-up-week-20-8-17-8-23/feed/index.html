		<description><![CDATA[LaRoche deserves more respect...

from fantasy owners
AND
Especially from the Atlanta Braves. He&#039;s batted mostly in the 7th and even down in the 8th. At what point to they concede to Laroche and put him in an order spot thats reflective of his talent?

Right now Garret Anderson is batting 5th. And he&#039;s just atrocious!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Freaking Red Sox had to trade for Laroche, which prompted me to drop him, and then they trade him away six days later! I wasn&#039;t able to get him back to enjoy the second half dominance :(]]></description>
