		<description><![CDATA[MY NAME IS RHONDA,  I HAVE CANCER.
 
     I was diagnosed in March. I purchased my first Snuggie at that time because I was beginning my Chemotherapy and they were so soft and warm.
     I was in the Hospital for ten days, the Hospital was so cold, and the lady in my room was an elderly women. Every night, my roommate would tell me how chilled she was. So I would walk to her bedside and cover her with my Snuggie. She was so grateful.  I felt she needed it more then me, so I called a friend and she shipped me another one.
     Since then my Snuggie doesn’t leave me. In the car, at my Chemotherapy treatments, everywhere I go my Snuggie comes with me.
I have noticed that in my Treatments everyone is cold, they have small covers but they are never big or warm enough.
 
Here is where I am going with this Story...
 
     I am starting a program called, “Covers for Chemo”  
This will be a not-for-profit program.
What I would like to do is get as many Snuggies to Oncology wards, and Chemo Treatment Centers across the country, in hopes that all going through treatment can have a little bit of comfort doing so.
     “PINK HEALS” is another organization for Cancer awareness through fire departments nation wide, and I am in hopes that they too may accept the donations at the various locations they visit.
I hope that you are willing to help me with this project,
     Any amount of donations or contributions by purchasing “Snuggies” 
at stores and delivering them to our local Hospital and the Chemo treatment center I go to, would help tremendously! 

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope you will help me in bringing a bit of warmth and comfort to all those affected by cancer.
 
Thank you,
Rhonda McGrail

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Jerry,

I’m sorry this letter is so slow in sending you get well wishes.  Being a long time (born right outside of Boston) Red Sox fan, I have followed them since I was a child…too many years ago.  So not only did I follow your entire career, but I have been entertained many an evening with your commentary from the booth. I was distraught when I first learned of your cancer, more upset to hear you had a nasty infection which weakened you and slowed your progress, and even more worried when I heard nothing about how you were doing. But I want you to know that I think what you did last week by going to Fenway and actually spending time in the booth took the most courage of probably everything you have suffered, and I’m sure you have suffered.  Physical pain and sickness is horrible enough by itself, but I know from experience that emotional pain is so much deeper and so often more difficult to get a handle on.  I am happy for those who have never had to experience it, but those same people have no idea what an awful overwhelming feeling you have been experiencing.

I can well imagine how anxious you were to just enter familiar surroundings which have always felt like home.  Suddenly, you feel like a fish out of water.  Easy for me to say, but you had nothing to fear.  I’m sure you were welcomed with open arms.  Everyone has missed you more than one could say, but I know how being away from the work one has done daily for so long can make one lose confidence, self-esteem, etc.  Again, nothing for you to fear.  Red Sox Nation loves you, Jerry.  I thoroughly enjoyed your time in the booth with Eck and Don O., and I give you the highest praise possible for what you were brave enough to say while you were there.  As a professional, one who is used to going to work daily, being thoroughly prepared, etc., it is so difficult to suddenly be out of the loop.  I had said to friends of mine, I don’t know how you could possibly have watched the games as it would have been so difficult to hear the laughter of others doing your job as no one can do quite like you.  As a true professional, rationally I know you know that Don O. and whoever his “guest” announcer is have to make it as entertaining as they can.  But, don’t forget for a minute how many people you have provided with so many laughs.  I have watched the video of you dancing and falling off the table countless times and roared each time, and I positively crack up when you and Don totally lose it and your laughter takes your voices right away from you.  Laughter is truly the best medicine, so I hope you will be able to laugh a whole lot more in a short while.

I am glad you are starting to feel better, but I still want to say the bravest thing I think you did was speak openly about your anxiety and depression.  You did thousands of people a big service in discussing your bout with those horrible demons.  You were wonderful in the booth, and I can’t wait for your return—when the time is right for you.  You ARE Red Sox Nation, Jerry—don’t you ever forget that.  Do what you need to feel better again, and I hope you are making daily progress in that direction.  I know from experience how exhausting depression can be, especially when one is trying to mask it from others and carry on in customary professional style.  It is a major struggle.

I hope what you experienced in the booth last week, difficult as it must have been for you, gave you a real shot in the arm.  You haven’t lost any of those qualities we all love about you—your quickness, your knowledge, your infectious laugh.  I look forward to the day you return, and in the mean time, please know that there are a great many people out there who know what you did last week had to be incredibly difficult, but you did it, and you did it with honesty, grace and sincerity.  I hope it helped you, but you also don’t know how many people you helped.

Feel better, take good care of yourself, and Red Sox Nation awaits your return.  They will always need you.

A devoted and admiring fan,
