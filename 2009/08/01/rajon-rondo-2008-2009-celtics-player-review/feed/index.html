		<description><![CDATA[Is there a more entertaining player in the league than Rajon Rondo? The trade attempts by the GM was just to see what the market had to offer. Geeze, Amare and Barbosa for Allen and Rondo ( rumor ) shouldn,t be takin personally. That&#039;s two great players for two great players. In conclusion I hope for a lot of things to happen. One, we resign Rondo. Two, we resign Ray for 2 more years at 5.5 per season. Three , Paul Pierce opts out of next year and resigns a 4 year deal at 6.6 mil season. Not sure of the exact dollar figures but that would be what ( if they did the above ) 12.1 for next year compared to around 35 million this year. A difference of 23 million. You should be able to sign Rondo and go after Dwayne Wade with that kind of money?]]></description>
