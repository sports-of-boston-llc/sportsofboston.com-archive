		<description><![CDATA[A lot of people really don&#039;t know how good this Bills team is. Watch out. I know I&#039;m scared. 

Like you said, KC, the Jets and Dolphins really aren&#039;t there yet. Mark Sanchez will be a disaster and teams will figure that Wild Cat out a lot earlier in 2009 than they did in 2008.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Jets won&#039;t be very good, and the Dolphins&#039; Wild Cat probably wont be as effective. The Pats should take this division easily, but it wouldn&#039;t surprise me to see the Bills go 9-7 (hell, they went 8-8 last year with no T.O.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Bills are a very good, young team. I see them finishing 2nd in the division this year. T.O brings a total different dimension to that offense. Having Owens will allow Lee Evans to be single covered, which is deadly. Trent Edwards has looked great in camp and should have his best season .. and then you have to look at both Marshawn Lynch and Fred Jackson in the backfield.

Not to mention an otherwise solid defense.

I wouldn&#039;t be shocked to see Buffalo grab one against us this season.]]></description>
