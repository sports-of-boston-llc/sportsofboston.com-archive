		<description><![CDATA[jerry,  it was so great to see you last nite.   on mlb package,  we do not always get nesn.  sometimes,  the other team&#039;s guys.  so it was with great joy that we had nesn last nite.  you look great, and it will be so good to have you back.
i know a lot about depression.  last nov.  while visiting daughter and family in vegas,  i started panic attacks.  could not get out of bed for days.  did not eat,  lost weight.  started taking my xanex i had for nervousness.  it helps.  finally,  fighting it and taking meds,  i started to feel like being in the world again.  my family and i could not understand why the least thing could trigger uncontrolable crying.  i was away from my doctor.
well, it took over 6 months and  now i can talk to people,  and not cry.   it is a good feeling.
God was so good to me!!!   he will help you too.
we await your return,  just not the same without you.  too much cheese, ha ha!!
your greatest fans,
john and betty bartman.

what is wrong with the red sox,   is tito&#039;s having to change the lineup around.  that is not good for a team,  we think.  there was not the same ole gang and we think that was why they did not play good.   so,  we blame theo for making tito live with too many players.]]></description>
