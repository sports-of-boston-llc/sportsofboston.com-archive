		<description><![CDATA[I was listening to the &quot;team&quot; fan conversation on my ride home and realized that you guys missed one important point. &quot;Teams&quot; are not teams for very long anymore. Long gone are the days of players being loyal to teams and fans. Players are now loyal to the biggest contract. The Red Sox of the past six years are now scattered across the league and the country so how can you be loyal to a &quot;team&quot; which doesn&#039;t exist?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m pretty impressed with the lineup. If you&#039;re gonna go through with it, you might as well go big. I&#039;m not so sure about the nightime guy...but Felger head-to-head with the Big Show is brilliant. Can you believe 98.5 even stole John Wallach??

I&#039;m a WEEI guy through and through, but I will switch back and forth definitely.]]></description>
