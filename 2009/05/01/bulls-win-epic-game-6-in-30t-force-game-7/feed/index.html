		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re right Chris, this stuff is brutal to watch.  These teams as they&#039;re currently constituted are ridiculously closely matched.  Yeah, with Garnett and Powe, it would have been a lot different, but &quot;coulda, woulda, shoulda&quot; doesn&#039;t really matter now.

You&#039;ve gotta wonder whether the Celts even SHOULD go to the next round.  There&#039;s no way they can offset Howard down low, and Pierce looks like he&#039;s ready for an iron lung after all the minutes he&#039;s played.  The young Bulls would probably have a better chance. They really don&#039;t have anyone to offset Howard either, but they&#039;ve got more offensive weapons than the Celts, and they seem to have more energy too.

One way or the other, I&#039;m hoping for a blowout Saturday.  My blood pressure is just too fragile for any more overtimes. My wife won&#039;t even stay in the same room with me while a game is on, and I don&#039;t blame her!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah I agree Ken. Rondo didn&#039;t have one of his better games last night. He looked to have ZERO confidence in his shot. Hopefully he can recover by Saturday. We&#039;re lucky he escaped with a flagrant 1 on Hinrich. Doc was ready furious at him for almost jeopardizing his chance to play.

Allen was unbelievable. Such a difficult game to watch...I couldn&#039;t take all the back and forth. Just when you thought it was over...everything changed.

These guys are playing like this series is the NBA finals; definitely one of the best Round 1 playoff duels I&#039;ve seen.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hate to say it because I love Rondo for the first 46 or so minutes of the game, but I do not want the ball in his hands with the game on the line. In game 4 he messed up twice at the end of each of the OTs in that game and last night was no different. You have to take it to the hoop and hope for a foul in that situation]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let&#039;s go with the adjectives: magnificent game by Allen; great games by Davis, Salmons, and Rose; good games by Miller and Pierce.  Unfortunately, the adjective for Rondo - I hate to say it - is &quot;intimidated&quot;.  Where was that driving, whirling dervish we&#039;ve come to love?  Hope he shows up Saturday.]]></description>
