		<description><![CDATA[Certainly his health comes first.  I have never heard of the disease until today and did not realize how serious it is.  I just hope he can get back to a normal life.  It still amazes, and saddens me, how someone at the top of their game physically, can be hit by things like this...similar to Mario Lemieux getting cancer.  Just shows you how fragile life is.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is very terrible news, even for a non-BC fan. I have a friend who is going through this same disease and it&#039;s very serious. Depending on where it is, there&#039;s possibility of amputation, knee replacement or a whole host of other options. It usually needs chemo too. Hope it&#039;s a case they can find out quickly and he can survive, let alone play football again]]></description>
