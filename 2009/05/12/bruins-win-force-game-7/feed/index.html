		<description><![CDATA[Thanks boss. Just sick of everyone talking out their ass haha. Good to see the passion though, thats what real fans are all about. I hope Bruins win tomorrow for sure, but to me nothing is sweeter as A B&#039;s fan than sweeping Montreal in their centennial season!]]></description>
