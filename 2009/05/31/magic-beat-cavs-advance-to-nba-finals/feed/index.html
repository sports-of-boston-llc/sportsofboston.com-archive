		<description><![CDATA[Yeah I never knew Redick to be a defensive stopper, but he did a fine job keeping Ray Allen at bay.

and you&#039;re absolutely right, the Celtics with a healthy Garnett and Powe would&#039;ve probably repeated as NBA Champs. Maybe two out of three aint bad?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This comment really belongs with the article that talks about the Celts losing to the Magic, but I was out of town, so here goes:

Van Gundy is indeed strange looking, but nobody has mentioned the absolutely brilliant move he made that beat the Celtics.  He put useless guard J J Redick on Ray Allen and told him to worry about nothing but keeping Allen from being a factor, and damned if he didn&#039;t do just that by clinging to Allen like  a piece of Saran Wrap.  By using Redick to stop Allen, and with Garnett out of the lineup, Van Gundy effectively limited the former big three to the big one (Paul Pierce) who exhausted himself trying to bear the scoring burden.  Redick wasn&#039;t expected to score (the Magic have plenty of scorers)and he hasn&#039;t played a minute since the Boston series- which proves that Van Gundy knew precisely what he was doing.  Why isn&#039;t anybody talking about this?

By the way, I have no doubt that the Celtics at full strength would have beaten both the Magic and the Cavs, and probably Los Angeles as well.]]></description>
