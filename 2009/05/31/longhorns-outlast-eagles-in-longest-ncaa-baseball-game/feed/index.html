		<description><![CDATA[I agree.  He threw 169 pitches all the while allowing only the two hits and four walks and K&#039;d 14, not to be repetitive.  This is their CLOSER!  BC&#039;s closer had a respectable 9.2 shutout innings.  I read today that Wood threw up in the midst of it due to intaking fluids too quickly.  He said his arm felt fine until he started icing it, but was on cloud nine all day.  I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the pitchers so much as the organizations.  When the arm is worth $50M, you want to take it easy on them.  Back in the day, when money wasn&#039;t as large a factor (remember baseball was only their summer job), they could obviously throw till their arm fell off, who cared.]]></description>
