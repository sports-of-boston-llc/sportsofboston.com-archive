		<description><![CDATA[I think we&#039;re going to have to start referring to these Garnettless Celts as the &quot;Back to the Wall&quot; gang.  Seems like they&#039;re two different teams - complacent when they&#039;re on top (ahead in a series), furiously competitive when they&#039;re in trouble (behind in a series).  Garnett&#039;s insistence on day to day intensity is sorely missed.

They broke that pattern by winning game three in Chicago.  Let&#039;s hope history repeats itself. 

Congrats to House, Rondo and Allen for coming on strong, and a special thanks to Perkins for more than holding his own against Howard.]]></description>
