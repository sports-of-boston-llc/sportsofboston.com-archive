		<description><![CDATA[Jeff speaks the truth.  Even if the up and down Celts manage to win on Sunday, I fully expect them to be swept by Cleveland.  Same goes for Orlando if they should win.  It&#039;s almost better to lose Sunday than face the awful humiliation awaiting them at the hands of the Cavaliers.  The lack of Garnett and Powe is simply too much to overcome.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is true, Ray Allen&#039;s offence was pathetic in game 6, but he is capable of lighting it up in game 7. Pierce, the same. With their playoff savey the C&#039;s will win handily.  Unfortunetly, the Cavalier&#039;s are way too much for anyone.  Even without LB they would beat Boston.]]></description>
