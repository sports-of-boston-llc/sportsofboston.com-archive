		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the info, Chris.  Hard to believe that the lowest of the refs makes $90,000.  Sure seems to be plenty of incompetence out there.  That phantom foul technical on Perkins in game 7 being a clear case in point, though there are many others.

I hate it when a game can be decided because of an obviously poor call, or if the ref&#039;s in a bad mood, or pissed off at a player or coach.  Seems insane, and it surely takes enjoyment away from the great game of basketball.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ken, according to an article on AskMen (http://www.askmen.com/sports/business_60/77b_sports_business.html), NBA officials make anywhere from $90,000 to $225,000, not too bad...

Oh yeah, bring on the Magic!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The refs were trying to force an overtime in game 7 with the multiple strange calls and touch fouls, they also took Ray allen out of the game in game 5 in order to even the mathchup. I know there were bad calls for the bulls also, but they benefitted from the crooked officiating in this series. The media needs to step up and start questioning the NBA&#039;s motvies with thier officiating because it&#039;s ruining basketball.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mighty glad to see that series end, and even more glad to see the Celtic bench come alive once again.  Who would have believed Scalabrine, for one,  could have such an impact just when the Celtics needed it?

I&#039;d like to believe the Celts could beat the Magic, but I must say I&#039;d be mighty surprised if it happens.  I just think the absence of Garnett will prove to be the difference.  Hope I&#039;m wrong.

By the way, does anybody know what NBA refs get paid for the playoffs?  Is it per game, or based on seniority, or what? And I&#039;d also be interested to know what they average for the regular season.]]></description>
