		<description><![CDATA[OH god. I can hear it now:

&quot;Chris Webber is not walking through that door, fans. Peja Stojakovic is not walking through that door, and Mike Bibby is not walking through that door. And if you expect them to walk through that door, they&#039;re going to be gray and old. What we are is young, exciting, hard-working, and we&#039;re going to improve. People don&#039;t realize that, and as soon as they realize those three guys are not coming through that door, the better this town will be for all of us because there are young guys in that (locker) room playing their asses off. I wish we had $90 million under the salary cap. I wish we could buy the world. We can&#039;t; the only thing we can do is work hard, and all the negativity that&#039;s in this town sucks...It makes the greatest town, greatest city in the world, lousy. The only thing that will turn this around is being upbeat and positive like we are in that locker room... and if you think I&#039;m going to succumb to negativity, you&#039;re wrong. You&#039;ve got the wrong guy leading this team.&quot;]]></description>

Enjoy watching your mediocre team from your high dollar seats in your new arena. On the bright side there will be plenty of seats available.]]></description>
