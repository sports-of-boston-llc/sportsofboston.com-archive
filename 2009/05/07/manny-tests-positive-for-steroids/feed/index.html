		<description><![CDATA[haha how can you absolve Canseco for absolutely lying about his friend Roger Clemens? He hates everyone else in baseball, and ratted them all out, which is good.

He never &quot;saw&quot; his friend Roger do steroids, but he also never saw ALL the other people he named. He also said that Roger is the only player to never cheat on his wife, which we know is already untrue too.

Putting Canseco in the Hall would be a disgrace!

Oh and Manny...how could you!???! Canseco didn&#039;t name Manny, he just speculated that he did it. See an article previously published on SoB: http://www.sportsofboston.com/2009/04/06/canseco-90-sure-manny-used-steroids/

If Pujols is taking it, he better stop, because obviously he will get caught.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Everyone is guilty. One big name after another will fall.

For all these big names finally being brought to justice, I think Jose Canseco deserves an apology.

Hell, for all of his allegations (though I dont beleive Manny was ever named by Canseco) coming true, I think that is reason alone for Canseco to be put in the Hall of Fame.

Pujols will be caught one day.]]></description>
