		<description><![CDATA[I just started watchin basketball around march of 09, and the first team i saw play was the celtics against a team that i dont even remember because boston played so well. It was Paul Pierce that drew me to this team when i saw him steal or rebound three shots back to back and convert them into three pointers. This sparked my fascination with the NBA. So im proud that they at least put up a fight and made it this far...The Fight of The Irish.]]></description>

Wait &#039;til next year!!]]></description>
