		<description><![CDATA[Rondo is so young and inconsistent. His game is not THAT well-rounded yet and when he has a step to the basket he is amazing. When he is hesitant that throws him off. As we saw in the playoffs, if he fires away without a second thought the shots will fall. He will only get better and when KG is back, the Celtics will be too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah he&#039;s way too young to shoulder this much pressure, but I think he&#039;s doing an exceptional job. The ball shouldn&#039;t be in his hands in the final minute, and he knows that too. 

Part of the reason he gets tentative about driving the lane late in the game is that he&#039;s SO bad at shooting free throws. Tommy Heinsohn said he was exhausted, which could explain the poor FT shooting, but he&#039;s never been that good. If he can refine that part of his game, and along with his developing long range shot, we&#039;re talking about a perennial all-star point guard in the East.]]></description>
