		<description><![CDATA[The guys looks done, if you don&#039;t see him pick it up you&#039;ll definitely see a deal made and Ortiz head to the pine. He can&#039;t catch up to fast balls anymore and looks like he&#039;s guessing up there.

Some of it has to do with injuries but if you pay attention, it looks as though pitchers are finally, after years of giving up homer after homer to him, realizing that they probly shouldn&#039;t pitch it down and in to him!]]></description>
