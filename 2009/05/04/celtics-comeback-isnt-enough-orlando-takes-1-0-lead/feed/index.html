		<description><![CDATA[From the second quarter through most of the third, the Celtics played about as badly as a professional team can play. It was so embarassing to watch, that I actually found myself laughing at their utter ineptitude at passing, shooting, ball handling and defense.  Who the hell were those guys out there? Marbury was the only bright spot in that sequence, and as Geoff said, was inexplicably absent the rest of the game.

Somehow, they discovered how to play defense again in the fourth quarter, and actually had a chance to win that game.  I hope the lesson wasn&#039;t lost - you can beat these guys, but it&#039;ll take a four quarter effort. And Allen, Rondo, and Perkins are going to have to score some points.

A final note or two:  the ball handling by Pierce is getting worse and worse.  He offsets it by making great shots, but every time he gets the ball I wince when he puts it on the floor. Chicago showed everbody how easy it is to steal from him, and Orlando didn&#039;t miss the films.  And since when did Rondo totally forget how to score from anywhere other than the foul line (let&#039;s not even mention that incredible air ball from the free throw line, okay)?  Some of his pass attempts late in the game were also laughable.  Maybe he&#039;s been reading too many of the press clippings from those early Chicago games.]]></description>
