		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t realize how good Nomar&#039;s career batting average is among active players, don&#039;t quote me but I think it&#039;s .313 and 8th in the league. I really hope Nomar makes it back to the Red Sox to end his career. He was definitely making it clear that that is something he wants. The guy has never won a World Series and we traded him in 2004, the year we first won it all. That has to be sour for him. I think if he&#039;s healthy maybe next year or in a couple years, he can really be a valuable asset, and maybe one of those guys that takes less money to try and join a team and win a World Series. Even if he&#039;s just a DH. I don&#039;t think the Mariners are contenders this year too, but think of Ken Griffey and the lift he&#039;s brought to Seattle this year. They&#039;re a team that has completely turned around from last year. When they beat us in a home series last week I think we saw that head on. 

It would be nice to see Nomar in a Red Sox uniform again. 

It would also be nice to see Trot Nixon again too but that&#039;s another story...I&#039;m biased, Trot Nixon is the man.]]></description>
