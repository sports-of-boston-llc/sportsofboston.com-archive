		<description><![CDATA[All I have to say is that this will be a terrible move if Leon&#039;s roster spot is replaced by some project big man (like POB) who will play only garbage time. 

The Celtics said that Powe&#039;s rehab was ahead of schedule and that he should return by the All Star break. I think he will still have a better shot at making an impact on this team in the playoffs than any of the guys Danny is looking at(Robert Swift, Michael Sweetney)

People seem to forget that Powe is still young at 25, and one of the hardest working guys I have seen, and I think he will come back as strong as ever.

This isn&#039;t out of sympathy either. People forget that Powe was our best player off the bench, and would have been starting in the playoffs. So who cares if he cant play yet!? Does it really matter if he misses the first half of the regular season? I still think he could be a BIG help for the team in the playoffs (when it matters)  at the cheapest price.

And now we&#039;re going after a guy who is 35 with declining skills and lack of heart and passion for the game for 2 years for the full MLE, while Leon will go on to have a great present and future for another team at a bargain price.

Today I am ashamed to be a Celtic fan. I&#039;ll miss you Leon!!!!]]></description>
