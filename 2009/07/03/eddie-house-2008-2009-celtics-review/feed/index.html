		<description><![CDATA[Good points, Ken.

I wonder if the Celtics consider bringing Steph back. He has to continue to realize that winning is more important than anything, even taking a huge paycut to remain a backup in Boston. I think he still thinks he has the skills to start (and he could), but at the end of the day, who would sign him in that role?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[House also inmproved in his defensive abilities.  I know he&#039;s too short, but he made up for it a lot with his quickness and tenacity.  The guy gives his all every time out, and you&#039;re right about his surprising &quot;clicking&quot; with Marbury.  Marbury loved all those assists he recorded when House got hot, as he often did. I&#039;m very glad he&#039;s going to be around next season.

So how about Marbury?  Will he ever get his touch back?  Seems to me he should have been shooting a lot better by the end of his season last year.  He had enough time to regain his shooting eye, but it didn&#039;t happen.  What&#039;s the feeling about Stephon?]]></description>
