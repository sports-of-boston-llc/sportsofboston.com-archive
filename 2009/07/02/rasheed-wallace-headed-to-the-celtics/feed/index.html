		<description><![CDATA[It was reported that Ainge, Doc Rivers, Grousbeck, and the big three went to meet with Wallace to ask him to take a mid-level contract to play for the Celtics.

Looks like they&#039;re really trying to make it happen.

		<description><![CDATA[This would be our core lineup:

PG  Rondo (PG)
SG  R. Allen (SG,SF)
SF  Pierce (SG,SF)
PF  Garnett (PF,C)
C   Perkings (C)
6th Wallace (PF,C)
7th Davis (SF,PF)
8th House (PG,SG)
9th T. Allen (SG)

Honestly, we would be solid up front with 4 bigs, but we are still week at the guard position.  Unless T. Allen improves (highly doubtfull), Kobe and Artest are going to give us a rough time.  We have to replace J. Posey, a solid veteran on the perimeter to relieve Pierce and R. Allen.

The problem is, I&#039;m not sure it can be done under the cap rules.  Maybe we could lure Marbury back by signing Rasheed, then trade House and T. Allen for a solid guy on the wing (SG,SF).  I love House, but look at the roster after that move.

		<description><![CDATA[Please sigh Rasheed!  If 2 years @ 5.8 million is not enough, then ask for 3 years.  With the Lakers getting Artest, the Cavs getting Shaq, and the Spurs getting Jefferson, the Celtics need to get someone too.  I am really hoping this happens, so a healthy 2009-2010 Celtics team can get back to the finals and get number 18.]]></description>
