		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re right, Chris.  Ainge has to play the free agent game the way it&#039;s played now, and he&#039;s certainly proved his expertise at that.  I&#039;m just whining about the way it used to be in professional sports.

I am wondering, though, how they convinced Wallce to be a non starter, and I&#039;m also wondering how he&#039;ll fit on a team that&#039;s been saying &quot;it all starts with the defense&quot; for the last 2 years.  Wallace has never seemed remotely interested in playing defense.  

I&#039;m wondering if there&#039;s more serious matters with Garnett&#039;s injury than anybody is willing to mention. Maybe Wallace is slated to take Garnett&#039;s spot if Kevin can&#039;t play?  Whatta ya think?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ken, very carefully! Fixed.

Well, we could have kept Billups, but we saw how that worked out... I guess it is a matter of the times: buy to compete. He&#039;ll be here for two years.

From the economist&#039;s standpoint (i.e. Ainge), he&#039;s only trying to optimize the value he can receive in the marketplace for a given commodity (i.e. a player). Do we want to be part of the Leon Powe wait-and-see camp? Is getting a player to help _now_ bad for the team? As long as an action moves toward further enabling the team to capture the title (legally of course), I say no.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How do you &quot;dawn&quot; a uniform?  When Rasheed dons the Celtic green it will mark another big off season move that is now so common among the top contenders in the league, i.e. get me someone who can make a championship possible NOW, and don&#039;t worry about the future.  Watching this NBA free agent version of musical chairs has got my head spinning.  I must really be old because I can remember when team building didn&#039;t involve plucking aging apples from someone else&#039;s orchard, but nurturing rookies, giving them real opportunities and showing a little patience.  That&#039;s all old fashined now, I guess, and any resemblance that NBA teams have to past NBA teams is just a fading memory.

Yeah, Rasheed will help, but the over 30 bunch that will be starting for the Celts better stay healthy, or this team will surely look ridiculous in the next few years.  And if Rondo leaves, well anybody want to guess which elderly statesman point guard will be arriving next?  Maybe Magic can lose a few pounds and give it a go.]]></description>
