		<description><![CDATA[Ky really messed up not recruiting Lofton. He was a great football player in high school,too. Hope the Celts decide to keep him, because in 2 years, he will be hard to handle. His hometown is about 70 miles from me, so we like to think of him as a local.Good luck, Chris, youll look good in GREEN! GO CELTICS, win no.18.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris Lofton would be such an asset to the Celtics.  His shooting ability, his work ethic, his personal story, would blend with them and enhance what they already stand for.  To have him on their team would bring along many, many Tennessee Vol fans who love and admire Chris.  Please give him a serious look...you will like what you see!!]]></description>
