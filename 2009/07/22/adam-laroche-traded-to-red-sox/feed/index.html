		<description><![CDATA[Good trade. Laroche is usually a second half hitter, will be a free agent, and can platoon with Lowell, with Youkilis moving around. Decent enough defense, has some power, not bad at getting on base. Hopefully he&#039;ll go to the opposite field more in Fenway and use the wall to his advantage.

This should eventually help the offense, and keep Lowell from playing too much, and keep Kotsay from ever having important at-bats. Those are all good, important things.

Laroche will hopefully pop a couple of home runs out to the short porch in right in NY in that ridiculous new stadium of theirs.

Strickland&#039;s like our 45th most-important minor league pitcher, and Our Heinous Diaz has struggled with the bat in Portland. More importantly, he was taking up a 40-man roster spot, and has (I think) already burned two option years, so he&#039;d have to make the Red Sox roster coming out of spring training next year, or else we would&#039;ve lost him on waivers. He&#039;s certainly not hitting like someone who&#039;d be likely to do that, especially since he seemed really nervous and uncomfortable this year in spring training.

With Diaz moved, Yamaico Navarro can move up to Portland, and then next year the Cuban SS kid we just signed can move up the ladder too, so it&#039;s not like Diaz had much of a chance to help the Sox. He&#039;s supposed to have a really nice glove, and maybe he&#039;ll play in the majors at some point, but we probably would&#039;ve lost him before the season next year anyway.

It&#039;ll be interesting to see what move they make to make room for Laroche. DL Kotsay? Release him? DL Lowell? Send a pitcher down?]]></description>
