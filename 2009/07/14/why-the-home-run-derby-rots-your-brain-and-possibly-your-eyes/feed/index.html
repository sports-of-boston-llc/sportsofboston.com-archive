		<description><![CDATA[Totally agree. It seemed very drawn out yesterday too. My TV Guide said it would end at 10PM, but it wasn&#039;t even close to being over at 10:15PM, so I gave up.

The yellow/green ball tails really added so much...oh look the ball is absolutely crushed...but you need this line to see it is a home run (btw...I&#039;m sure that worked very well with those having color blindness...the UI-mind in me speaking).

At least Erin Andrews was there to provide the on-the-field reports. Her interview with Josh Hamilton was especially informative. She asked so many questions about his recovery and the fact he almost missed the entire first half of the season...oh wait she didn&#039;t. :sadface:]]></description>
