		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a shame it came to this for Walker.  He had plenty of talent and gave the Celtic fans some real thrills.  Probably would have been a Celtic &quot;great&quot; if he hadn&#039;t been so in love with the 3 pointer.  His dribbling skills and touch down low were terrific, and one could only wince when he insisted on playing from outside the 3 point line.  He and Pierce had some great games together, and he was smart enough to publicly insist that the Celts sign a young Paul Pierce to a long term contract.  I hope things work out for him.]]></description>
