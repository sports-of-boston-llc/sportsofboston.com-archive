		<description><![CDATA[Former major league pitcher Tom House used steroids during his career and said performance-enhancing drugs were widespread in baseball in the 1960s and 1970s, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Tuesday.

Steriods have been around 50 years. I am guessing 75% of the HOFers since 2000 were on some sort of PED, including all three this year. 

Griffey, Rickey, Cal, Eck, Smoltz, Fisk, et al were using something]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Disgraceful! Jeff Bagwell and Ivan Rodriguez both, no doubt about it &#039;roiders made the HOF!  And I understand Bonds and Clemens didn&#039;t make it but picked up more votes than they&#039;ve ever had in the past! That&#039;s just plain nuts, these bums were juicers, period!  Congrats Mr. Tim Raines, you earned it and deserve it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You would think &#039;roided user who denies it, Albert Pujols would just get the hell out and retire, and quit embarrassing himself!  But I guess he&#039;s greedy!  I mean he made fools out of the Angels management by acquiring him.  And he is not one bit ashamed of his career with the Angels! Or at least be a stud like Ted Williams and &quot;request&quot; a decrease in pay!  I know Albert, you never got caught, and you even  threatned Jack Clark for telling what everybody else in the big leagues knew, you were a user! Damn you were only 30 years old when you went downhill, !  Gee, when was that, I think it was 2010 just when baseball did their biggest crackdown on you cheaters!  Of course that was just a coincidence!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let me put it this way!  If doing steroids was a capital offence all of these guys would be going to the chair!  Did I mention Ripkin?  Yes, he&#039;s one of them.  But he was smart, smart cheater that is, he didn&#039;t get carried away with the stuff!  Yes, I am unbelievably upset that these guys tainted the likes of Mays, Gehrig, Mantle, Aaron, Ruth, Williams etc.!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Roidriquez,&quot; is finally retiring after cheating his way through baseball throughout his career! This guy with his half-hearted admissions was doing the &#039;roids all the way up to the time he got caught a few years ago!  His turtle tears are so disgusting!  Good riddance to both he and Teixiera, they are two disgraceful ballplayers!  I really don&#039;t know who&#039;s more despicable! Flip a coin!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Also would like to state that I could be wrong and that some baseball players, the sneaky ones may have been doing &#039;roids in the early 80s as opposed to the late 80s!  Hate to say it, as he was one of my heroes, but Mattingly MAYBE could have dabbled!  Of course I have zero proof, but just sayin&#039;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I note, Mark Teixiera has announced his retirement today, 8-5-2016 and for the record &quot;I&#039;m glad we&#039;re getting rid of one more outrageous cheater in baseball!&quot;  This guy oozed steroids from his pores!  And I might add, looking at the Yankee Website on ESPN, they have the nerve to call him one of the Yankees all time great first baseman who ever wore pinstripes!  What a disgusting joke!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Disgraceful that Piazza is getting into the HOF!  This guy for sure was juicing his whole damn phony career!  I&#039;ll give Jr. a little benefit of the doubt for most of his career, but I believe he too for a couple years did a little juicing!  The amount of these guys juicing are off the charts!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dude! Athletes weren&#039;t messing with Roids until the late 80&#039;s!  And only a few hard heads, like Canseco at that!  Maybe Mark McGwire was the second player courtesy of Canseco to try the stuff in baseball!]]></description>
