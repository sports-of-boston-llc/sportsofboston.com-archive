		<description><![CDATA[The Celtics still maintain a void at backup PG. Although Marquis Daniels is capable and Eddie House serviceable, that remains a position of weakness.  My solution would be Ronald &quot;Flip&quot; Murray, a tough  minded, capable playmaker and above average score. And he is from Philly and a former teammate of &quot;Sheeds. Plus he is acclimated to a reserve role and flourishes, unlike Marbury.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for the first real update in quite awhile.  I was especially gratified to see that Rondo wasn&#039;t mentioned at all in regard to trade rumors.

My only question is why Nathan&#039;s story is positioned below the old-as-death feature on Austin Ainge.  Why are we forced to look at that face every time we turn to this website?  Nathan&#039;s story deserves top billing.  Let&#039;s get Austin way down below somewhere.

By the way, in my opinion Bowen would be a waste of space, and Marbury has evidently gone mad, or maybe he always was mad but managed to hide it at the end of last year.  Is the guy actually working on getting his skills back, or has the internet gone to his insane head?
