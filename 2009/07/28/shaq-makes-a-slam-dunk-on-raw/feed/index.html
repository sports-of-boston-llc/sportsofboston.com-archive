		<description><![CDATA[What a shocker, ANOTHER Cena/Orton Title match. God forbid they would push Evan Bourne (their most talented worker).

Wrestling today is terrible and painfully predictable. It is nowehere near what it used to be. Since the WWE has cornered the market (TNA will never be a legit threat), they can do what they want and the viewer has to swallow it.

So get ready to see another John Cena vs Randy Orton main event. 

Here is the ending: Orton will kick Cena&#039;s ass the whole match, Cena will make a comeback, do his stupid 5-knuckle shuffle (worse that the people&#039;s elbow), give Orton the FU (attitude adjustment) and then Rhodes and DiBiase will interfere and Cena wins by DQ thus setting up the next Cena/Orton PPV headliner.

Then HHH will somehow get involved in the story and get another title shot because he is f**king Stephanie McMahon.

Wrestling sucks.]]></description>
