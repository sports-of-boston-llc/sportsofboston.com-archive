		<description><![CDATA[Boston has to shop for more young players to replace some fading stars.
They need to be more futuristic in their choices and stop grabbing on to players who who have histories of not being available when it really matters.

Let&#039;s make 2010 the year that we show what we are made of. Go Sox Nation!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think a B- is a little harsh seeing that the team still managed to win 95 games this year (third-highest in the MLB) despite no production from Ortiz before June 6th, Dice-K&#039;s injury and no consistency from their shortstops (just to name a few). It&#039;s hard to give them a high grade because they choked in the playoffs, but I would probably give them a B/B+.]]></description>
