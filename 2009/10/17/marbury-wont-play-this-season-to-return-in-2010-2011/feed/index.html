		<description><![CDATA[Well, it&#039;s easy to see why Marbury wouldn&#039;t think of playing for $1.3 million a year.  Just do the math. Let&#039;s figure 82 games plus preseason plus practices throughout the year.  That gives us about 100 games total.  Further, let&#039;s be generous and say Marbury would play about 20 minutes per game.  Now we&#039;re up to a season consisting of 2000 minutes of &quot;work&quot;.  Divide that by 60 and you get a total of 33.3 hours per regular season.  Now let&#039;s divide that into $1.3 million, and Marbury&#039;s hourly rate would be a mere $40,000 (rounded off) per HOUR to play basketball.  Now how could any self respecting athlete be expected to put up with a mere pittance like that?

I might add that my social security payments are approximately $12,000 a year.  SO it takes me 3 1/3 years to reach what Marbury could make for one hour of basketball.  My heart bleeds for his pain.]]></description>
