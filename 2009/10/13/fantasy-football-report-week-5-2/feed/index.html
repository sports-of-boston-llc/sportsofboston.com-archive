		<description><![CDATA[Wow, 190 yds!

Flacco has had two 300 yds passing games this season and they were against Kansas City (Worst defense in football with over 400 yds allowed per game) and Cleveland (4th worst defense in football with over 380 yds allowed per game).

In two other games, he has failed to reach 200 yds passing and in those games, he has combined for 3 TD and 3 INT.

If you want to be impressed, then the New England game was good. Then again, the Patriots are showing weakness in their defense, especially with Kyle Orton throwing for 330 yds on them. 

So yes, play Flacco against poor defenses...just like anyone else.]]></description>
