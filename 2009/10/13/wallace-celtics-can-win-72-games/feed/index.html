		<description><![CDATA[Um, no they can&#039;t.  Today they lost their 2nd game already, and they aren&#039;t even to 10 wins yet.

I&#039;ll listen to the guys who ACTUALLY are playing, not the guy who desperately joined a team in hopes of chasing another championship because he is too old to do it himself.]]></description>
