		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a good question and I would have to say while all four point guards are very good I would only trade Rondo straight up for Derrick Rose at this point. 
Rondo is much better than Harris and Calderon defensively and I think that over time, Rondo will figure things out somewhat on the offensive side which would make him a top PG in the NBA.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A very well reasoned article, George.  Here&#039;s the big question:  Taking Arenas (injury prone) and Williams (more of a 2 guard in my opinion) out of the equation, would you trade Rondo even up for Harris, Calderon or Rose?  We&#039;re just talking Eastern Conference here, of course.

My answer would have to be a big &quot;maybe&quot;, but I&#039;d really like one more year before I&#039;d commit.  How about you?]]></description>
