		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Either way it was a crappy weekend, but we, as fans, must pick ourselves up and focus on next weekend. Get that living room clean, stock that fridge up with beer, make sure you have a nearby pizza place on speed dial and maybe get a board game ready because next Sunday’s game against the Titans could get ugly fast.&quot;

- What is your chosen board game?  Does it depend on the score?

In general, I really dislike your cynicism, but you are hopelessly optimistic on one point.  If Brady doesn&#039;t get it together this year, we&#039;re not going to see him return to his old form as you suggest above in &quot;future years.&quot;

Cheers!  Excellent blog!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I appreciate your input from the grave Tupac, or wherever you are. When are you coming back by the way? 

Anyways, I think fans are (and should be) concerned about Brady&#039;s performance so far this year. You cannot compare his situation to Peyton&#039;s or Carson Palmer&#039;s because they didn&#039;t miss any time. Brady sat out for a whole year and I think it is clear that it is taking longer than we expected for him to get back to form. Obviously he is still a great QB and is not the only reason we have lost two games, but the fact of the matter is this Patriots offense is leaving a lot of points on the field, which is something you cannot afford to do against the top teams in the conference.

Also, about the third WR. Brady has shown that he can be very productive and efficient with Troy Brown as a number one guy so Julian Edelman in the slot is not the issue to discuss here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To paraphrase Brady, &quot;It&#039;s called &#039;mid-season form&#039; for a reason.&quot;

Perhaps you should look at Peyton&#039;s stats through the first 9 games last season after knee surgery.
There is nothing major to be worried about.  The fact that we have seen some &quot;spurts of excellence&quot; should encourage you (and the fans) and that it is just a matter of time before Brady is tossing Chad Henne-esque passes to Moss.  

I also think too little is being placed on the lack of a third receiver.  Hopefully Brandon Tate can do something positive in the passing game once he comes off the PUP list after this week.  He said he has the playbook &quot;down pat.&quot;  I can&#039;t wait for him to get some reps at WR and see him return some kicks (as long as he&#039;s healthy).

Brady not being able to beat the Broncos is just something the media (like you) like to overhype.  The fact that he can&#039;t beat Mike Shanahan is a more accurate statement.]]></description>
