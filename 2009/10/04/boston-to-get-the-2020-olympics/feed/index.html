		<description><![CDATA[Since 1996 the summer Olympics have been held in Australia, Europe, Asia and South America. It is appropriate for the games to return to North America. Within North America the games have been hosted in the mid west, west coast and the south of the US as well as Mexico City and Montreal. The populous, strategic and popular North East of the USA has not had a chance. Possible cities are New York (too busy and too many distractions), Philadelphia (seriously?), and Boston. 
Boston has a wonderful sports history, is seen as the &quot;Mother city&quot; of the nation, spectacular cultural institutions, is close to the ocean, mountains, rivers, lakes, small towns and big cities, possese comprehensive transport systems and already major sport and residential facilities. 
Boston has the additional benefit of being most peoples favorite city. Seriously, when traveling, tell people you meet that you live in Boston and the comments range from, I love Boston, I wish I lived there, it is my favorite city, we had the best time there, I want my kids to go to school there. 
it is time Boston took its place as one of the premier cities of the world and one way to do it is to bring the worlds attention by hosting the Olympic Games. 
Boston 2024. It can be done.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey John, I&#039;ve got some new news on the 2020 feasibility study for the Summer Olympics. It looks like according to the Washington Post, the USOC spokesman said the US most likely won&#039;t be bidding for the 2020 games considering the loss for NYC in 2012 and Chicago in 2016. 

The state house will be voting in the coming weeks on whether to move forward with the feasibility study for a future games in the Commonwealth. It&#039;s looking more likely to be 2024 as the earliest year for a bid here. 

I&#039;m working closely with some former committee members from a Boston bid in 1996 to create a new committee to study the prospects ourselves and get some support for a bid.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Boston has the best chance of any US cities, unless New York or Chicago try agin.  They can build a stadeum near Wonderland(know that Dog raceing&#039;s illigle) and give it to the NE revoltion when after.  metro Boston is about the same sizes as metro Atlanta, and Boston has a better subway system (though building a new line would not hurt)  and they can have bring back baseball at Fenway park.]]></description>
