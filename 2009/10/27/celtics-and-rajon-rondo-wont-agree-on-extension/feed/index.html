		<description><![CDATA[You know, it&#039;s getting harder and harder to be a sports fan.  The insane amount of money going around in every major sport is simply nauseating.  The sheer greed, the overwhelming non concern about any semblance of loyalty - it&#039;s really getting to be a bit too much.

The Celts offer a kid $9 million dollars a year with a 5 year contract - and he&#039;s insulted by the offer!  What planet are we on?  How can this amount of money be sneered at, and how can we even comprehend the level of self importance that someone must feel to say &quot;No, $9 million a year just isn&#039;t enough for my ego to accept?&quot;

With all the &quot;downsized&quot; victims of our current economic situation losing houses and being economically destroyed every day, with thousands of Americans going hungry and/or sleeping in the street or a flop house, how in the world can anyone look at himself in the mirror and say, &quot;Nah, I need at least $12 million a year to be happy. $9 million just won&#039;t hack it&quot;.

I can&#039;t wait to see the next NBA commercial about how the NBA players care so much about our downtrodden.

I&#039;ve got to stop now before I throw up.]]></description>
