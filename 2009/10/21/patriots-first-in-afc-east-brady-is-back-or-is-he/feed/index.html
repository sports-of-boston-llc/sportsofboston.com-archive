		<description><![CDATA[Maroney will surprise many fans that have lost faith in him. With Morris and Taylor out, he will finally have the opportunity to be the primary back, something that ge wasn&#039;t able to be last year because of a shoulder injury (that he actually played through for a bit). I am not putting too much stock into his previous game because the titans gave up halfway throgh the 2nd Q - but you could tell he was being patient and waiting for holes to open up. I expect him to have a great game against TB (if he&#039;s gven 15+ carries) - but the real test will come against Indy and Miami.

I also can&#039;t wait to see what Tate can do.]]></description>
