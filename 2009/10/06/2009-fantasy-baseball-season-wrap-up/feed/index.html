I was pretty dead-on with my &quot;questionable decisions&quot;.

I still can&#039;t believe my team was knocked out in the first round. Over 300 wins and it was all for nothing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good stuff, Pete. I was lucky enough to pick up Reynolds from free agency in one league and draft both Grienke and Cliff Lee (in the later rounds) in that same league. And, wouldn&#039;t you know it, I won that league. Like one Roman philosopher once said, “Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.”]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Pete.  I felt like I was reading a WhosWho on my team in the disappointments: Martin, K-Rod (though still had high K/9 which counted in the league), and Hamels. Ubaldo Jimenez was a good pickup for me as he had a very similar turnaround like De La Rosa and finished with a 3.47 ERA, 198K, and 15W.  Cliff Lee was a good value pick for me: round 7 for the reigning Cy.]]></description>
