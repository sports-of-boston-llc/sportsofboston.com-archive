		<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed your guard preview, KC, but I&#039;m surprised to hear that Marbury is still in the running as a member of the Celts.  Is that really a possibility?

I am happy that Pruitt is gone, though he wasn&#039;t given much of a chance,and I just hope he doesn&#039;t come back to haunt us like Joe Johnson.  He just seems too meek to be a point guard in the NBA.  Now watch me have to eat my words if he suddenly blossoms elsewhere!

I really hope that Doc gives Giddens a real chance to show what he can do, but in the past our beloved coach has shown a real reluctance to seriously test the younger generation.  A few minutes here and there is simply not enough, and if you have to risk a few games early in the season to find out what you&#039;ve got in your draft choices, so be it.

Looking forward to the forward preview!]]></description>
