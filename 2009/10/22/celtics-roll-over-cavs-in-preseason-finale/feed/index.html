		<description><![CDATA[Bombs away! Sheed will take plenty of threes, he&#039;s averaged over 300 3PA the last three seasons. He&#039;s never been a classic post player. Much like KG, he&#039;s more of a straight up jump shooter. So if KG frustrates you, Sheed will drive you batty. If he plays as consistently in Boston as he did the past three years in Detroit, expect Sheed to take roughly 10 shots a game, 4 of those from behind the arc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Marquis Daniels looks impressive indeed. Get him anywhere near the basket and he seems to be able to score at will. Definitely a great addition to the team.

However, I&#039;m a bit worried about Rasheed.  Am I imagining it, or is he shooting virtually nothing but 3 point shots?  I appreciate his skills out there, but he&#039;s not exactly Eddie House, and that big body can surely do some damage on the low post.  Or, maybe he&#039;s too old to bump and grind inside.  What do you think?  Should we expect nothing from him but&quot;bombs away&quot;?]]></description>
