		<description><![CDATA[I have to agree that Rondo is a great fit for the Celtics. Rose works in Chicago because he can create for himself, just as Rondo works in Boston because he creates for his teammates. I am now eating my words from Saturday when I was nearly positive that Rondo would hold out and try to go for a max contract after this season. I&#039;m glad that he signed and locked himself in for five years AND is getting the money that he wants. As long as the Celtics keep scorers on the floor around him, he will continue to be a huge asset to the team.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you&#039;re probably right George, but let&#039;s change the question just a bit.  Would you trade Rondo for Rose right now, as their teams are currently constituted?  Not to build a franchise around, but as a straight trade at this very moment?  Personally, I think Rondo is more valuable to the Celtics than Rose would be if you simply swapped the two guards.  Maybe not for the future, but with the Celts going for a championship this year, I&#039;d have to say that Rondo seems perfect for this team. At the same time, I don&#039;t think he&#039;s perfect for any other team - a point he might want to consider with all this salary crap going on.

Whaddaya think?]]></description>

It&#039;s really hard to base their value on stats because their roles are very different. However, I would still take Derrick Rose over Rajon Rondo because Rose has the ability to create his own shot and score, not to mention he is only in his second season so he has great upside. Rondo still doesn&#039;t have a consistent jump shot (he might never develop it) so it is hard to build a team around him. He is going to rack up amazing assist numbers because he is surrounded by four future hall of fame players. Rose might be the only future hall of fame player on his team. So if you&#039;re asking me who I would pick to start a franchise I would take Derrick Rose all the way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On October 16, George wrote a nice article on point guards in the East, and concluded that the only one he&#039;d trade Rondo for &quot;even up&quot; was Derrick Rose.  I wonder, after last night&#039;s game, if he still feels that way.  How about you Sarah?

The Celtics look so good right now that it&#039;s almost scary.  Too early to take it too seriously, but my oh my they&#039;re a joy to behold right now, and that bench seems absolutely peerless.  Hope it lasts.]]></description>
