		<description><![CDATA[Garnett looked much better than I had expected.  Let&#039;s hope there was no day-after pain.

I hope somebody talks to these rookie refs.  Over 100 foul shots in a pre season game is simply unacceptable.  I&#039;m sure that&#039;s just what the fans paid to see.

Too bad Sweetney is so enormous.  That guy has plenty of talent, but it&#039;ll go to waste (or waist) if he can&#039;t lose about 75 pounds.]]></description>
