		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, Ken. I know it isn&#039;t much, but at least Garnett mentions he&#039;s 85-90% ready. I agree, they&#039;ll definitely carry him along slowly, which means we&#039;ll see more Rasheed Wallace and Big Baby. Forcing &#039;Sheed into action early may be good for him, because it&#039;ll force him to get used to his teammates.

If Garnett can never get healthy this season, you can kiss the Larry O&#039;Brien Trophy goodbye, sadly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, KC, for the long awaited update on KG, but I think I&#039;m more confused than ever after those strange quotes.  What is clear is that Garnett is not at full strength and is still rehabilitating.  I would imagine that he&#039;ll have reduced playing time for the next few months at least, and we&#039;ll probably be seeing a lot of Rasheed Wallace - which is not exactly a thrilling prospect.

Can&#039;t say I&#039;m very confident when thinking about the lousy defense that Wallace plays.  Could change the whole direction of the team, especially with his Jekyll and Hyde personality.  We&#039;ll see.]]></description>
