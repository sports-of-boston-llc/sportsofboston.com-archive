		<description><![CDATA[At the end of the day, the Scutaro signing shouldn&#039;t be an issue.  Two years is much better than three or the four to Lugo. If Scutaro performs at 2009 levels with his glove, great. If he doesn&#039;t, for short years and money, it still looks good. Hopefully Marco&#039;s excitement will help him stay loose and play well in Boston.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why are you still talking about Pedroia at SS?

We just signed Scutaro at SS. Thats the title of the thread. Talk about him!

Moving Pedroia to SS was most likely a ploy just to get a better deal. And it might have worked!

He&#039;s a steal at 2yr/$11.

Very little risk. And in 2 years we&#039;ll be talking about Iglesias.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[moving Pedroia to SS is not a good idea. He&#039;s already a gold glove caliber 2B, so why lose that? Yeah he could probably get the job done well at SS, but after years of being a 2B do you really want to make him go through that transition? He goes to his right better than almost any 2B in the AL, but going to the hole at short is a whole different story]]></description>
