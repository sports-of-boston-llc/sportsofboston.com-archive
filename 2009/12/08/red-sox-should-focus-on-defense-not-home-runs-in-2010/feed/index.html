		<description><![CDATA[well, i&#039;d have to say reading this just minutes after hearing jason bay has signed with the mets, you are so right. i loved jason during his short time with the red sox, but it just makes sense to let him go. next offseason&#039;s free agent market is going to be rich with talent and the red sox will have big contracts coming off the books. joe mauer and carl crawford are two names i would love to have added to boston&#039;s lineup. we also need to retain josh beckett, or else look at felix hernandez or someone like that as an alternative.]]></description>
