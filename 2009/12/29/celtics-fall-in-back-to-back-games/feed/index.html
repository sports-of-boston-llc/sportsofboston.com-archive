		<description><![CDATA[Greg is right.  It&#039;s really hard to get a handle on this Celtic team.  At times they look invincible, then they simply fall apart and look like a bunch of old men (Rondo being the exception).  One thing is clear - when they&#039;e missing a key player or two, their bench simply can&#039;t compensate.  Eddie House rarely scores meaningful points, and you never know what you&#039;ll get from Rasheed.  It&#039;s just a very inconsistent bunch, I&#039;m afraid.

If they ever manage to get everyone healthy and playing up to their potential....well, let&#039;s hope it happens soon.]]></description>
