		<description><![CDATA[Oh I didn&#039;t want to insult your knowledge of the game. I just wanted you to admit that Odom has been a crap fantasy player this season and last season.

I had no reason to discuss what Odom had done in the prior years because that was not the point of my argument.

Last season was my first season back in fantasy basketball after a three-year hiatus, so I never got to experience the good Lamar Odom. So when it came time to make my pick, I asked you guys what you thought of Odom and of course, Brick said he was crap and you defended his honor.

And we all know the story from there.


SIDE NOTE

Lopez had the better week than Howard due to FT%, which I failed to mention in the post.

Howard: 25/39, 64.1 FT%
Lopez: 24/26, 92.3 FT%]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[HA! As long as you admit Brick was like Nostradamus with Odom, I will agree to that and I accept being wrong about his fantasy value for the 2008-2009 season (I never denied being wrong about this, ever...). His fall from &quot;grace&quot; really wasn&#039;t expected.

But, I don&#039;t know why you won&#039;t admit his numbers from 2004-2008 were not only good for your fantasy team, but also good value in the sixth round (where he was typically drafted).

Ditto about Alston. 

If the point of these comments is to insult my fantasy basketball knowledge, you have done that (even if you&#039;re incorrect). I&#039;m going to go cry in the corner now :(]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Last season, when I asked Brick in the draft room if I should take Odom, he definitively said &quot;NO! and proclaimed that he was useless.

The two of you argued back and forth about the matter for a few minutes and then it went away.

As it turns out, Brick was right as since then, Odom&#039;s minutes have diminished and he has become worthy of dropping in most leagues.

Brick was like Nostradamus when it came to Odom. Brick was right and you were wrong.

Rafer Alston sucks too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We&#039;re not even arguing the same thing. 

Odom&#039;s past his prime already, and will not be a Hall of Famer. In a situation where Pau Gasol was NOT there, he&#039;d pick up more of the offensive slack. I last &quot;sang his praise&quot; before last season, but I didn&#039;t realize how much he&#039;d be taken out of the offensive gameplan. So when Brick was hating (back in 2005 or so), he really was hating for no reason.

and because I know both of you know I&#039;m right about Odom&#039;s past value (because that point is impossible to argue), I&#039;ll stop talking about him (I didn&#039;t even bring him up!).

Lopez is a good player yes, but I just felt that was a bit early (in just Lopez&#039;s second year). He seemed like a sleeper candidate to me, and I felt it was early to put him in the same class as Paul Pierce and Carmelo Anthony.

and finally...I think Dwight Howard was better than Lopez this past week, based on the numbers!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t care what Lamar Scrotum has done in the past. Today, he is a piece of garbage.

Even as late as last season you were singing Odom&#039;s praises, and he was ineffective at that time as well.

Stop hating on Brook Lopez. It is true that I didn&#039;t take the risk on him, but I wasn&#039;t the one who was overcome with rage when I saw how high he was ranked on Yahoo! and on Funston&#039;s Big Board.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t love Odom! I just hate Brick&#039;s unwarranted hate. It makes no sense. Look at his early career when Brick actually hated him. He was averaging around 15 points (on about 48% shooting), 10 boards, one block, and one three per game from  2004-2008. That&#039;s not a good fantasy player in the sixth round? You guys are crazy haha.

On Lopez: He is a good player, but on every team, even the awful ones, someone needs to score/produce. He&#039;s the best player on one of the worst NBA teams this decade. You weren&#039;t willing to take the risk on Lopez! I thought a second or third round pick was completely ridiculous, but I also forgot that all NBA teams have at least one good fantasy player. On the Nets, it&#039;s Lopez.]]></description>

But, look at Odom&#039;s past years, he was pretty valuable!]]></description>
