		<description><![CDATA[Since I wrote this article, i&#039;ve actually gone back and forth on should the Sox pull the trigger and the simple answer is that if you can get a top three all around player in the league for a few prospects, you have to do it.  IF the Sox can get him without ruining the current core of players, then why not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Red Sox traded Hanley when Theo was gone on his gorilla-suit &quot;sabbatical,&quot; and supposedly he was upset that the team moved him, even though the trade was a big part of the 2007 championship. I&#039;m sure there&#039;s nothing Theo would like more than to get him back.

Along with Buchholz, we&#039;d need to include Enrique Iglesias, the young Cuban defensive whiz SS, who would be a huge fan favorite in South Florida and who would be cheap for years and years. Buchholz, Lowrie &#038; Iglesias might be enough to get Florida interested. And if Florida would do that, then Boston should jump all over it.]]></description>
