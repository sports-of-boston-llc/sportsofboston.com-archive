		<description><![CDATA[Far from sucking (balls) most people (at least myself) read these articles for the content of what is in them. I knew nothing about Stephen Drew other than that he is related to Soxer J.D. And now I know just about all I need to. I also think the author &quot;Greg&quot; was not implying that the Sox have a trade deal coming out for S.Drew, or that the D&#039;backs want to get rid of him... I believe it was just an opinionated article filled with numerous facts. So the next time, &quot;Bill&quot;, you decide to use provocative &quot;this article sucks balls&quot; on a well written, informational piece that other people find entertaining, I&#039;d hold your tongue. Also, I wouldn&#039;t demand sources without doing some research yourself.

I think this is a great article Greg. I wish we could be friends and talk further about Boston Sports, it seems you have extreme passion for everything you comment on, thank you for providing to us fans.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bill,

You can check out http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2009/10/cafardo-on-drew-reynolds-gonzalez.html or http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2009/09/discussion-stephen-drew.html and both of those notable posts show that the Diamondbacks &quot;might&quot; be shopping Drew, it never says that they will be. 
Now that the Sox have Marco Scutaro at short it is highly unlikely that Theo will even be looking at someone like Stephen Drew, but you never know. 
Arizona would get rid of player like him because of how far down his stats went over this past season and they want to see his worth on the market. Like the Red Sox found out, there isn&#039;t much out there for shortstops and I am sure Arizona knows that as well. If they could get some good prospects for Drew then I think they would make the trade. 
These are all rumors of course and Theo never comes out and gives away what he plans on doing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The rumor came from the Globe...
First, it was discovered on RealGM: http://www.realgmbaseball.com/src_wiretap_archives/17792/20091129/boston_has_inquired_about_stephen_drew/

RealGM picked up the story from the Globe: http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/articles/2009/11/29/lowe_prefers_not_to_be_spun_out_of_braves_rotation/?page=2

So there, Bill. That&#039;s where it came from. If they get overwhelmed with a deal, they&#039;d definitely trade him. Albert Pujols is closest thing to an &quot;untouchable player&quot; anyway...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Where did this rumor come from? I&#039;ve seen almost every rumor coming across the hot stove and Stephen never came up.

Why would the Diamondbacks get rid of such a player? What would be their incentive?

Normally, I like to withhold judgement... but this article sucks... balls. I await your reply]]></description>
