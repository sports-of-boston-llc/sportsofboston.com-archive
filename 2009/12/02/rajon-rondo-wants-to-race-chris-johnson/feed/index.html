		<description><![CDATA[I do not leave a lot of responses, however i did a few searching and wound up here Rajon Rondo 
Wants to Race Chris Johnson &#124; Sports of Boston. And I actually do have 2 questions for you if 
it&#039;s allright. Is it just me or does it give the impression like a few of these comments look like they are written by brain dead visitors? :-P And, if you are posting on additional social sites, I&#039;d like to keep up with 
everything fresh you have to post. Would you list of 
all of your social sites like your twitter feed, Facebook page or linkedin profile?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I guess know one remembers CHRIS HUMES from Los Anegeles High who ran a 4.15 in the 40. Was recruited by USC first. Then after some academic challeneges USC went after Reggie Bush. Now that would be a race Chris vs Chris on Los Angeles High track...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hardwood is a slower surface than grass...the grass feels lighter.  That said, I feel Rondo would run a 4.35-4.5, but would easily beat Bullock, but lose to Chris Johnson in the foot race.  However, I think Rondo would easily defeat Chris Johnson in a 1-on-1 match.  I wonder how well Chris Johnson can cross people up in basketball, if he can shoot and defend.  Basketball isn&#039;t just pure speed, it&#039;s more about the hand-eye combination and having a wide collection of skills.  Just leave the respect to players of each sport.  In fact, Antonio Gates and Justin Gage were basketball players, and they didn&#039;t look that fast on the court.  Ron Curry was a basketball player, and Rondo would school him easily.   They were much faster on the football field.
The 40-yard dash is a different discipline, and sometimes it&#039;s just not that meaningful.  It&#039;s how well you play in your sport.  I say they should get it over with as soon as possible, so people would stop talking about this.  Both of them need to concentrate on their own sport.  You know what would be a good skillls matchup, LeBron vs. Merriman.  Or Adrian Peterson.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hope this is just a joke.  Wouldn&#039;t it be just wonderful to have Rondo tear a hamstring or something similar and spend the next few months on the sidelines?  For a $2000 bet?  Give me a break.  I&#039;d hope that Celtic management or the NBA has the sense to step in and stop this foolishness.]]></description>
