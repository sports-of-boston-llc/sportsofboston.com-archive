Some of his coaches have found success in college &#8211; not so much Weis, of course &#8211; but none have found true pro success yet. How can a coach so consistent and widely regarded as Belichick not have successful assistants working for him?</p>
<p>In his decade with the Patriots, Bill Belichick has become the best coach in the team’s history with a 109-46 record, four Super Bowl appearances, including three wins, and the perfect 16-0 regular season in 2007, the only one of its length in NFL history. He has guided the team to six division titles in nine seasons and, with the exception of his first season in New England in 2000 when the Patriots were 5-11, has never finished with fewer than nine wins. The Patriots were arguably a dynasty in the early 2000s, joining the rarefied air that the Steelers, 49ers, and Cowboys enjoyed. Belichick’s 109-46 record far exceeds the rest of the coaches who are a combined 275-312. He also has a playoff record of 14-3, besting the 7-10 record the rest of the franchise’s coaches have mustered and has coached as many playoff tilts as the rest combined!<span id="more-32381"></span></p>
<h2>The Belichick Tree Spans the NFL, NCAA, and Executive Ranks</h2>
<p>However, while his coaching record has been impressive in New England, his protégés have been unspectacular in the professional ranks. As one of the Bill Parcells disciples to find success in the NFL, it is reasonable to expect that Belichick’s understudies would carry on the tradition, but so far Romeo Crennel and Eric Mangini have struggled in stints as head coaches and Charlie Weis, another high profile New England leaf on the tree has fumbled at Notre Dame. Josh McDaniels is in his rookie season as a head coach and is currently struggling after an impressive 6-0 start to his coaching career. Jim Schwartz is also in his first year as the Lions Head Coach.</p>
<p>The college branch of his coaching tree seems to be finding more success and, interestingly, shared time with Belichick outside of New England, with the largely anonymous Cleveland Browns tenure. Belichick and Company were 36-44 with only one playoff appearance in five seasons, as a Wild Card in 1994, the only season his Browns even exceed the .500 mark. Kirk Ferentz, Al Groh, Pat Hill, and Nick Saban all worked under Belichick and now steer Division I programs.</p>
<p>Belichick has not only spawned head coaches, but people in other roles in the sport. Thomas Dimitroff (Atlanta Falcons), Ozzie Newsome (Baltimore Ravens), Scott Pioli (Kansas City Chiefs), and Mike Tannenbaum (New York Jets) all are general managers. Others in coaching to watch are Jeff Davidson (Carolina Panthers Offensive Coordinator), John Mitchell (Pittsburgh Steelers Assistant Head Coach), and Rob Ryan (Browns Defensive Coordinator). Dimitroff has the Falcons on an upward trajectory after the Mike Vick and Bobby Petrino debacles set the franchise back. Newsome and the Ravens have won a Super Bowl this decade and played the toughest style of defense the league has seen in this generation. Pioli cleaned house this off-season in an effort to resuscitate a lowly Chiefs franchise which included bringing in a new head coach, trading for Matt Cassel and Mike Vrabel, and cutting former first rounder and the disgruntled Larry Johnson to see the team improving every week. Tannenbaum is having a rocky time in New York with the Mangini hiring and firing, the Brett Favre experiment, and now seeing the team guided by rookie Mark Sanchez who is beginning to play like a freshman.</p>
<h2>Head Coaches Who Have Worked Under Bill</h2>
<p><strong>Romeo Crennel (Cleveland Browns: 24-40, 4 seasons, 0 playoff appearances):</strong></p>
<p>Crennel was Defensive Coordinator on some great Patriot defensive teams, including the one that shut down the “Greatest Show on Turf” St. Louis Rams in a major upset resulting in the Patriots first Super Bowl win. His tough style never seemed to resonate with the players in Cleveland as the team won six or fewer games in three of his four seasons. In the third season, they broke out for 10 wins, just missing the playoffs and finishing second in the AFC North. After regressing the following year, Crennel was fired.</p>
<p><strong>Kirk Ferentz (Maine: 12-21, 3 seasons, 0 playoff appearances; Iowa 80-53, 11 seasons, 4-3 bowl record with another upcoming):</strong></p>
<p>Ferentz was the offensive line coach in Cleveland and has been in Iowa ever since. Ferentz has no NFL head coaching experience, but has had good success at Iowa, including shares of two conference titles and a long undefeated run this season which had them in contention for a Rose Bowl bid. However, in an empirical comparison, Ferentz has fared much better as a coach after Belichick (Iowa) than before (Maine).</p>
<p><strong>Al Groh (New York Jets: 9-7, 1 season, 0 playoff appearances; Wake Forest: 26-40, 6 seasons, 0 bowl appearances; Virginia: 59-53, 9 seasons, 3-2 bowl record):</strong></p>
<p>Groh worked under Belichick in Cleveland, but they have crossed paths throughout their career and is currently looking for a new job after being fired following a 3-9 season at Virginia. An interesting barometer for Groh is his two college stints. The Wake Forest tenure was before he worked under Belichick while the Virginia reign came after. The numbers are not all that different, indicating the Bill had no tangible positive effect on Groh. His Demon Deacons never finished in the upper half of the ACC and only once broke .500. Virginia has had five finishes above .500, but only one in the last four seasons.</p>
<p><strong>Pat Hill (Fresno State: 92-61, 12 seasons, 4-5 bowl record with another upcoming):</strong></p>
<p>Hill was Belichick’s tight ends and offensive line coach with the Browns. After leaving Cleveland, he took over Fresno State and has made them a perennial success in the WAC. He has won one conference title and has placed third or better in 10 of his 12 seasons. His stint with Belichick was early in his career and he has yet to foray into the NFL head coaching fraternity.</p>
<p><strong>Josh McDaniels (Denver Broncos: 6-5, 1 season, TBD playoff appearances):</strong></p>
<p>McDaniels’ hiring this off-season made waves in the NFL for a few reasons. McDaniels is only 33 and this will be his first head coaching experience, but he was a hot commodity in large part because he was the offensive coordinator for the Patriots from 2006 to 2008 which included the historic offensive, undefeated 2007 season. His Broncos started astonishingly fast at 6-0, including a win over the Patriots, but they were playing with fire with a number of close games. Their luck turned around with a five game losing streak, including the loss of their lead in the division.</p>
<p><strong>Eric Mangini (New York Jets: 23-25, 3 seasons, 1 playoff appearance; Cleveland Browns: 1-10, 1 season, 0 playoff appearances):</strong></p>
<p>Mangini may be the most famous Belichick disciple largely due to the Spygate controversy in his rookie season as Jets head coach. He guided that team to a 10-6 season, finishing second to the Patriots, but lost both regular season games and their Divisional round game to his mentor. After consecutive third place finishes, including a failed roll of the dice and late season collapse with Brett Favre, he was fired by New York. Cleveland wasted no time snapping him up and the black cloud followed. The team has been dogged by weak management (Georgo Kokinis’ firing mid-season), allegations of poor player treatment (involuntary charity bus ride for rookies, James Davis suspicious injury), and poor play.</p>
<p><strong>Nick Saban (Toledo: 9-2, 1 season, 0 bowl appearances; Michigan State: 34-24-1, 5 seasons, 0-3 bowl record; LSU: 48-16, 5 seasons, 3-2 bowl record, 1 National Championship; Miami Dolphins: 15-17, 2 seasons, 0 playoff appearances; Alabama: 31-8, 3 seasons, 1-1 bowl record with another upcoming):</strong></p>
<p>Saban was Belichick’s defensive coordinator with the Browns, giving up his Toledo job to go to Cleveland. A lackluster stint at Michigan State somehow merited the upgrade to the LSU job, where he excelled, including the split National Championship with USC. Most famously, he joined a wave of successful college coaches testing the NFL waters where he failed to make the playoffs in two seasons. In an unforgettable move, he assured the Dolphins, fans and media that he was in Miami for the long haul, only to jump to Alabama as soon as they asked. Back in the college ranks, he has been successful once again and is vying for this season’s National Championship if they get past Florida in this weekend&#8217;s SEC Championship Game. He was another Belichick follower to have no success in the NFL, though his college days speak for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Jim Schwartz (Detroit Lions: 2-9, 1 season, 0 playoff appearances):</strong></p>
<p>Schwartz was a scout in Cleveland in the Belichick regime. After Detroit finished a historic 0-16 season, ownership purged the organization from top to bottom, including the head coach. While he is off to a slow start, which was expected given where the team began, the team looks a lot better than they did last year and their overall number one selection, quarterback Matt Stafford, has been the primary starter this season and looks capable of helping the team improve in the short term.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Weis (Notre Dame: 35-27, 5 seasons, 1-2 bowl record):</strong></p>
<p>Weis was the darling head coach to be in the middle of the decade. His offensive guidance on the Patriots three Super Bowl teams and development of unheralded Tom Brady appeared as strokes of genius making him a commodity sought by NFL and NCAA teams alike. His major negative was his lack of head coaching experience, but Notre Dame gave him a shot with a six year contract. After two successful seasons (19-6, including 2 BCS bowl appearances, both losses) and top ten recruiting classes, the Irish extended Weis’s four remaining years to 10. After 3-9 and 7-6 seasons (with a Hawaii Bowl win), the Irish are on the bowl bubble and his winning percentage has dropped below that of each of his predecessors. The loss to Navy (second in three years) turned up the pressure and the loss to Connecticut has even Weis talking about his firing as deserved. The Stanford loss, the fourth in a row to end the season, was the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back as Weis was removed.</p>
<h2>Why is the Belichick Coaching Tree Not Bearing any NFL Fruit?</h2>
<p>Belichick’s mentor, Bill Parcells, has a oft-cited coaching tree featuring Belichick (3-1 Super Bowl) and Tom Coughlin (1-0 Super Bowl) most notably, but also has a new generation of promising coaches Todd Haley (Kansas City), Sean Payton (New Orleans), and Tony Sparano (Miami).</p>
<p>Bill Walsh has arguably the most famous coaching tree with the likes of (Super Bowl record):  Jim Fassel (0-1), Dennis Green, Paul Hackett, Mike Holmgren (1-2), George Seifert (2-0), and Sam Wyche (0-1) directly. His more extended tree includes Brian Billick (1-0), Bill Callahan (0-1), Tony Dungy (1-0), Jeff Fisher (0-1), Jon Gruden (1-0), Andy Reid (0-1), Mike Shanahan (2-0), and Lovie Smith (0-1). Each of them took teams to the Super Bowl except Paul Hackett who spent time in the NCAA as head coach of Pittsburgh and Southern California.</p>
<p>So, why is Belichick’s tree not bearing as much fruit as the others? Does he just need more time? I would argue no since he has already had a number of coaches try their hand at coaching without much NFL success. More time may improve it, but there is enough data to rule out any statistical anomalies.</p>
<p>Are his coaches just getting bad deals? Crennel landed with a disorganized Cleveland franchise, while Schwartz has inherited a historically bad Lions team. Mangini landed in a decent spot in New York, but he took over a disaster in Cleveland. Meanwhile, McDaniels in a good position to succeed in Denver. I would argue this is not the reason either as it is rare for a playoff caliber team to have a playoff opening. Aside from the Steelers a couple years ago, playoff teams just do not change things, perennially bad teams do. So, Belichick&#8217;s men would be at no more of an advantage or disadvantage than any other candidate.</p>
<p>Is he too controlling, so his mentees never get the proper feel of the decision making they need as a head coach? This could be a possibility as we know Belichick is involved in every detail of the team, down to the field itself, but his decisiveness itself could be a model for other coaches and players. Even if it turns out you make the wrong call, you believe in yourself, staff and players to execute the decisions and adapt as necessary. Developing a plan, sticking to it, and having the flexibility to learn and alter it are important characteristics for a leader to have.</p>
<p>Are these coaches just not <em>that</em> good? When Weis left, McDaniels stepped in and the offense did not miss a beat, even setting offensive records in 2007. With Brady healthy now, the offense with McDaniels gone looks as if it has not missed a beat. Crennel left an aging defense behind, so was the slide because he was gone or was this coming anyway?</p>
<p>Is this a &#8216;sum of the parts greater than the whole&#8217; situation? Are Belichick&#8217;s coaches, combined with him as a unit, conjoined into a singular football mind? My feeling says that the coaches that have moved on are specialists and that is perhaps translating into running their side of the ball, but maybe not the team as a whole. Also, it certainly will be a number of years more, and another &#8220;generation&#8221; of coaches on his tree, like McDaniels may be, before his coaching family can be as prolific as Walsh&#8217;s was, but to this point, Belichick looks even more like a genius with each successive failure of his former coaches on their own.</p>
