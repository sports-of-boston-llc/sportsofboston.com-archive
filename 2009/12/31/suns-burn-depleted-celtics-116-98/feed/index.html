		<description><![CDATA[Ken - you may be right about Giddens and Walker. It looks like they&#039;ll be getting extended minutes tonight against the Raptors...with Rondo, KG, and Pierce all out. uh oh?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[About the only positive thing you can say about last night&#039;s game is that Eddie House finally scored some meaningful points.  Seems like a long time since we could say that.

As KC points out, any team would be in trouble without two of their key men in the lineup.  So we can pretty much count on the Celts getting beat by just about any other team right now.  How I would love it if Doc just accepted that fact and gave Giddings and Walker about 30 minutes each.  Let&#039;s find out what they can do when it&#039;s not garbage time. The games are probably lost anyway - wouldn&#039;t it be nice to discover a potential star in your midst?  Can&#039;t find out unless you let them play.]]></description>
