		<description><![CDATA[Eddie is on some kind of roll right now. He seems to be able to hit from anywhere on the court. I hope Celts fans don&#039;t get any allusions as to how much time House will get the rest of the way, he&#039;s just in a ridiculous hot streak right now and will eventually cool off. Until then, keep shooting Eddie!]]></description>
