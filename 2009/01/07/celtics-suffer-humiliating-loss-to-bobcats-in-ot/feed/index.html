		<description><![CDATA[Jeff - your guess is as good as mine.

Ken, many good points as usual.

I would like to think that the Celtics could get &quot;mentally&quot; ready for their games coming up against the Rockets and Cavaliers. Both teams are playing good basketball, and wins over both would be huge for the Celtics as they try to get back on track.

and I agree...why not give more PT to people like Gabe Pruitt? He may prove that we don&#039;t need Stephon Marbury at all. What we really could use is a PJ Brown-like center to back up Kendrick Perkins.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, Tommy Heinsohn says the team is mentally tired, which is making them physically lethargic with no intensity.  &quot;They need a mental vacation&quot; says Tommy. He goes on to tell us how brutally hard it was to travel out to LA on Christmas day.

Excuse me, but if you paid me 6 or 8 million a year, I think I could find a way to juice up a bit after 3 months of the season.  So the poor guys had to play away from home on Christmas day - what a tragedy!  And certainly a good excuse to go into a mental nosedive.

They don&#039;t make &#039;em like they used to,I guess.  American cars and basketball players.  I can just imagine Larry Bird getting mentally fatigued.  What a laugh.
How about giving this exhausted bunch a rest (Paul Pierce excepted - he&#039;s still putting out). Let&#039;s bring in the kids, including the lost boys sent down to the minors for more playing time.  At least it won&#039;t be so embarassing if they look foolish out there. Man, what a difference a couple of weeks makes.  I&#039;m scared to death of what&#039;s likely to happen in Cleveland on Friday.]]></description>
