		<description><![CDATA[They had to fire Jags. At this point...how could they trust him to stay on at BC? They had to fire him so quick because it&#039;s recruiting season anyway. Why would recruits come to a coach who&#039;s looking elsewhere.

In the same breath, I don&#039;t blame Jags for taking the interview with the Jets. I would&#039;ve done the same thing...prob could&#039;ve handled it better with BC though...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think he&#039;s going to get the Jets job, but he&#039;ll get paid anyway, unless he&#039;s fired for cause, which that non-interview clause would be.  He coached at BC when Matt Hasselbeck was there and with Mora in Atlanta, so landing in Seattle is possible.  He did a great job at BC, especially this year with the loss of Matt Ryan.]]></description>
