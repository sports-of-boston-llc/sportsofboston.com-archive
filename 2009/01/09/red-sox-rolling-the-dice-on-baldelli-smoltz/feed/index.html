		<description><![CDATA[CC might be an injury concern as well with all the innings on his arm.  I think he has the heft to be able to take the wear and tear, but he throws hard and a lot.  You&#039;re right on with everything else.  The Yankees needed to make those moves to fix their rotation and its still only Wang, CC, and Burnett when healthy.  Hughes, Kennedy, etc aren&#039;t much to speak of.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You may think you&#039;re right...but I remember when the Yankees traded for Randy Johnson and they were set to win 115 games and the Big Unit would win 30. That didn&#039;t come close to happening. They&#039;ll score a lot of runs...probably 900 or so, but that wasnt their problem last year. They had a huge problem with pitching. CC is a big asset at the top of the rotation, but AJ Burnett is close to an automatic injury. After that they have Chein-Ming Wang coming off an injury, Joba Chamberlain (who&#039;s in between a SP and a closer)...and Phil Hughes, who may not be ready for the big time yet.

On paper, the Yankees are a 100-win team again...but that also means that everyone performs exactly as they should and stay healthy. Tex is a notoriously slow starter, so he may fall out of favor at first with new yorkers. AJ Burnett will probably get injured..and what could they expect out of Jorge Posada this year? Can he even catch? and what of Hideki Matsui?

Here are the guarantees for the Yanks:
CC Sabathia
Mariano Rivera
Derek Jeter
Alex Rodriguez
Mark Teixeira

So...a little luck and a lot of health, and the Yankees will be in first place. 

Remember, the Sox had a TON of injury problems last year and still won 95 games. If they are healthy most of the year (except for JD Drew), you&#039;d think they can win at least that amount again...]]></description>
