		<description><![CDATA[I am not Irish, but I married into an Irish family.  So, what is the feeling among the Irish, I wonder, that the mascot of the Celtics is an Irish dwarf?  I mean, why not go for the whole sterotype, and have him drunk and fighting and with 20 kids?  Why not have the pack of them come out, beat up the opposing mascot, and then puke on the court?  

I mean, we have to have some sensitivity here to the Irish, don&#039;t we?]]></description>
