		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s too bad that Logan is leaving the program as well, it would have added some stability had he stayed.  However, word was that Spaziani was out if he didn&#039;t get the job, so I guess they couldn&#039;t keep both.  I give both Logan and Jags lots of credit with Crane.  He was awful when the season started and progressed to where he was actually decent.  If he hadn&#039;t got hurt, we would have beaten Vandy for sure and probably VT.  Davis just wasn&#039;t good.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Logan is a great offensive coach, if not a bit of a gambler. It&#039;s obvious in the offensive stats of his ECU teams, and the clear fact that Crane got better as the season progressed. Had he not gotten hurt, I think BC would have beaten Va Tech and Vanderbilt. Unfortunately, Crane&#039;s back-up played horribly. Can&#039;t blame all of it on Logan. He kept BC in the game with a QB that couldn&#039;t hit the broad side of a barn. He had a great sports talk radio show down here in NC before  he went up to BC. He liked to play Jimi Hendrix and classic blues during interludes. He can also jam on the guitar. We&#039;re hoping that he comes back to NC. It will be our gain,and BC&#039;s loss. Go Deacons!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Logan is a fine offensive coach.  The problem was a lack of an experienced runner and quarterback (partly the coaching staff&#039;s issue for not developing Crane in 2007).  Crane actually was playing decently by the time of his injury and Davis just did not have the tools at the time to be successful.]]></description>
