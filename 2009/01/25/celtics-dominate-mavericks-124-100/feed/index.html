They need to make sure they grab home court, because it was SO crucial last season.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[KC said it perfectly - &quot;When the Celtics are on they can beat any team in the NBA....&quot;.  Man, are they on lately!  They&#039;re just destroying teams this past week, and looking like a perfectly oiled machine in doing it.  Two weeks ago, I couldn&#039;t bear the thought of the Celts going against Cleveland.  Now I just wish that LeBron&#039;s bunch was heading to Boston tomorrow, and that LA was right behind.  I&#039;d surely like to see those two losses avenged in Boston.

Let&#039;s just hope there&#039;s no letdown, no meltdown such as we saw after the 19 game winning streak.  Might be a good idea to lose one before &quot;streak pressure&quot; boils over.  But just one, okay?]]></description>
