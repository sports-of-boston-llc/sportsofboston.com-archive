They can afford to take chances and backfill while other teams would need to depend on these players if they were going to allocate 1.5-2.5 million. These kinds of signings work much like the draft. The relative cost is lower for a team with a higher budget. It&#039;s surprising to see they don&#039;t have more competition for the John Smoltzes, Rocco Baldellis, and now Takashi Saitos of the world given there are other teams out there with similar needs and financial means (the Yankees, Mets, Angels, just to name a few). I think it&#039;s a signal that the valuation model of the Sox is truly value-based, and fundamentally different than many other wealthier teams out there.]]></description>
