		<description><![CDATA[Toine got unlucky in that he ended up with back-to-back teams that wanted to go &quot;young&quot;.  Sure, his &quot;arrest&quot; didn&#039;t help matters afterward but seriously, it didn&#039;t really seem like there was any team out there(any veteran-playoff team) that wanted his services at this point.

Plus, I heard that he didn&#039;t really feel all that comfortable in joining new teams mid-season so perhaps he told his agent to just pack it in for this year and he&#039;ll try again next season.

I, for one, believe THAT scenario and not the one where no one wants him which is ABSURD considering the talent he still has and the fact that he&#039;s 32-going-on-33 and has at least 3 GOOD YEARS(4 Tops) left.  

I hope he latches on to another playoff team &#039;cause he deserves to be heard in the NBA once again.  My opinion is that he should strive to latch on to a team that would win a championship and then retire the following season so as to finish his career on a high-note.  

But hey....that&#039;s not up to me.  That&#039;s up to Toine.]]></description>
