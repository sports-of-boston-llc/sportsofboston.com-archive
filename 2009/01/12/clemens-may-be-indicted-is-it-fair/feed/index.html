		<description><![CDATA[Jeff, I agree with a lot of your points.

Roger Clemens is pond scum, and so is Barry Bonds. Both men likely lied to a grand jury, which is a federal offense. Thus, like any normal American, they should be indicted (Bonds already was, Clemens could be).

Had the government not stepped in, idiot Bud Selig would&#039;ve done nothing but hide the growing steroids issue. Now, I don&#039;t think they should hold congressional hearings about the nature of steroids in baseball, but they had &quot;no choice&quot; because Selig and the rest of the bums in the MLB&#039;s front office made so many critical blunders. They should ALL be tossed.

Congress can do a lot of things, but they can&#039;t apply the appropriate punishment for Clemens and Bonds. The true appropriate punishment would be...i agree with you...banishment from baseball or something similar. 

So, in the end, I hope Clemens is indicted just like Bonds, due to the rules of the Constitution, but I also hope that both men are pardoned by Obama. That is the right way to put an end to it. I mean...I think Obama has plenty of other problems to deal with...]]></description>
