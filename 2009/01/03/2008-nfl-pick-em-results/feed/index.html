		<description><![CDATA[The Seahawks had Deoin Branch...who obviously benefits from a good healthy quarterback like when he was with Tom Brady. This year, he had an unhealthy Matt Hasselbeck and an unreliable Seneca Wallace. So I&#039;ll give you the benefit of the doubt there.

But the record still stands, the Seahawks passing offense was above average at best, and their rushing offense was below average at best. Put that together with bad luck and a coach on his way out, and you get the 2008 Seahawks. 

I chose Arizona with the inkling that Warner would be the starter, and I knew all along he&#039;d be throwing to Anquan Boldin and Larry Fitzgerald. I imagined Edgerrin James would have a bigger role, but I guess that didn&#039;t matter in the end. 9-7 was good enough for the division title, where it would&#039;ve been two games out if they were in the AFC Wild Card picture.]]></description>
