				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although the <a href="http://www.beabetterbettor.com/sports-livescore/basketball/nba/eastern-conference/boston-celtics.html">Boston Celtics</a> never stopped being interesting, they’re officially on the verge of juggernaut status once again. And they don’t appear to be going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
<p>This is a big deal when you consider where the Celtics were just a few years ago, having traded Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Jason Terry ahead of the 2013-14 season, beginning what everyone thought was an extensive rebuild that would take years to complete.</p>
<p>So much for that.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2017/02/17/celtics-picks-boston-celtics-predictions/">Boston Celtics Are Emerging As Title Challengers</a> (538 words)</p>

The Celtics are colliding with the defending NBA Champion Cleveland Cavaliers for the Eastern Conference title. After disposing of the both the Indiana Pacers and Toronto Raptors in four straight, the Cavaliers have had time to prepare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Should Head Coach Brad Miller’s charges make it to the conference finals, there will be plenty of NBA expert picks and naysayers saying the Celtics don’t have the horses to match up with Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, Lebron James and company. On the season, the two teams split two games, successfully defending its home court. If either team has an advantage, it lies in the fact Boston holds home court advantage due to its #1 seeding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For all the tipsters who are releasing NBA expert tips naming the Cavaliers as the play, they might want to consult with Boston’s little mighty mite Isaiah Thomas. Even at 5’9”, Thomas has proven to be a nightmare for opposing defenses all year long. Taking everything into consideration, it wouldn’t be a shocker to see Thomas take the league MVP honors over players like Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry (two-time reigning MVP), James Harden and Kawhi Leonard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the regular season, Thomas finished third in the league in scoring with 28.9 PPG on 44.3% shooting from the field, 36.7% from beyond the arc and 87.6% from the charity stripe. No one will soon forget game two of the current series when Thomas and Washington point guard John Wall engaged in an old fashion NBA shootout with Thomas taking the honors with 53 points in a big overtime win. What made the performance all the more impressive was Thomas had given a eulogy for his sister just days before the game. He had also been in the hospital on the day of the game for treatment on the teeth that had been knocked out in the prior game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As current NBA expert picks would indicate, the Celts are going to need other contributions in order to topple James and the red-hot Cavaliers. That help will have to come from </span><a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4240/avery-bradley"><span style="font-weight: 400">Avery Bradley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, who has been feast or famine throughout the playoffs. After averaging only 6 points per game in games 3 and 4 versus the Wizards, Bradley responded with a spectacular performance in game 5. He scored 29 points on 12 of 19 shooting from the field to go along with 6 rebounds and 3 assists. If he performs anywhere near that level against the Cavaliers with center Al Horford controlling the middle, the Celtics would seem more than capable of springing a surprise on the way to the NBA Finals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the conference championships and finals next up on the schedule, now is the time to be </span><a href="http://www.bettingpro.com.au/subcategory/basketball/nba/"><span style="font-weight: 400">looking for NBA expert tips</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.

<p>Since The Celtics acquired Isaiah Thomas things have been different.  He has brought a buzz around Boston that has been missing since the big three.  Now, basketball fans want to see Isaiah and These Celtics compete on national television.  Which will finally happen.</p>
<p>All NBA fans know Christmas day is the biggest day of the year for the NBA. It&#8217;s the day where superstars, and the best teams compete with the world watching.  It says a lot that The Celtics will be playing. No, this doesn&#8217;t mean the rebuild is over.  The rebuild will continue until the next championship comes to Boston.  However, all the &#8220;experts&#8217; see what&#8217;s brewing in Boston.  We have a young team, a great coach, and now have two all-stars.  Plus, Boston is a sexy pick to challenge the Cavaliers in the eastern conference.</p>
<p>This could and should be a successful season for The Celtics.  The additions of Al Horford, and Gerald Green are great pickups for this team.  Horford is a bona fide all-star, and Gerald Green will be great providing scoring off the bench.  How about Ray Allen?  We all know The Celtics struggle with shooting, so why not give Allen a chance?  I would.</p>
<p>The Celtics had 7 nationally televised games last year.  This season?  They are scheduled for 22.  The Boston Celtics are finally back on the map.</p>

<p><strong>The Red Sox</strong></p>
<p>With the all-star break behind us it&#8217;s time for The Sox to focus on the second half of the season.  The Red Sox started on the road against their arch rival Yankees who are having a terrible year.  Stephen Wright got the ball in game 1 of the series and was well rested since he wasn&#8217;t allowed to pitch in the all-star game, (Which is another story in itself).  The Yankees couldn&#8217;t touch Wright until the 6th inning, but with Boston bats hitting 3 Homeruns it was to much for The Yankees to handle.  Game 2 of the series was all about Eduardo Rodriguez, he went 7 innings while only giving up 1 earned run.  Oh, and Sandy Leon hit a 3 run homerun, what a find he has been for this team.  It is important The Sox get all the wins they can now, the end of their season is a gauntlet with more than half of their games on the road.</p>
<p><strong>The Celtics</strong></p>
<p>Trade rumors have been all the talk in Boston.  Blake Griffin? Russell Westbrook? Jahlil Okafor?  Nobody really knows if The Celtics will make a deal, and who it will be for.  As a Celtic fan you have to be excited, there&#8217;s hope around this team right now.  If The Celtics are to land one of these players I think they&#8217;ll be seeing Cleveland in The Eastern Conference Finals.</p>
<p><strong>The Patriots</strong></p>
<p>Jimmy Garoppolo is the starting quarterback for The Patriots for the first four games of the season.  There has been mixed feelings around if Brady made the right decision or not.  However, taking the suspension now is the smart play, I&#8217;d rather have Brady missing the first four then the last four.  This suspension will also be good for this teams future, either the league sees that Garoppolo can be a starter in this league and we trade him.  Garoppolo plays really well and Belichick keeps him around to one day take over for Brady. Or worst case scenario, Garoppolo plays terrible and The Pats start off the season with a losing record.  All and all I think The Pats will be just fine, and that a pissed off Brady coming back is bad for the NFL.</p>

<p>The Celtics recently lost out on the Kevin Durant sweepstakes when he opted to sign with the Golden State Warriors on July 4th, but now it looks like Danny Ainge is trying to acquire the other superstar player from OKC and bring him in to the current crop of C&#8217;s players, including newly signed big man Al Horford.</p>
<p>Oklahoma City obviously lost a huge part of their team when Durant left town and with only one year remaining on his contract, Thunder management must figure they should ship Westbrook off now and get something for him, instead of letting him enter free agency next summer where he could potentially leave for nothing.</p>
<p>The C&#8217;s are in prime position to deal for Westbrook because of the plethora of valuable trade-chips they have including young players like Avery Bradley or Marcus Smart, any of the six selections from this years draft, and most notably, the remaining Brooklyn Nets picks that project to be high lottery selections once again.</p>
<p>Adding Westbrook to this Celtics squad would make them the runaway favorites as the one team that could challenge the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference, as well as an instantly more exciting team due to Westbrook&#8217;s electric, sometimes over-the-top, style of play.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is since this will be Westbrook&#8217;s contract year, there is no guarantee he will resign next summer when his deal expires. This could affect the value of a potential trade for Westbrook in which Ainge uses this as leverage so he doesn&#8217;t have to give up as much to get him.</p>
<p>No matter what may happen these next few weeks, the Celtics are clearly showing they aren&#8217;t messing around this offseason and are serious about winning a title within the next few years. Although Westbrook might not put them over the top, they&#8217;ll be much closer to glory than most and will be one fun team to watch next season.</p>

After being up 3-1 in the Western Conference finals, Kevin Durant and the Oklahoma City Thunder collapsed and lost the series to the Warriors. Now Kevin Durant is simply joining the team that he couldn’t beat. Over the last few days he has been taking a lot of criticism about his decision to join a team that won 73 games last year and has been to the NBA finals back to back years. I think he deserves the criticism he’s getting because I feel like he’s taking the easy path to winning a ring. Where’s the competitiveness, where’s the fight to want to come back next year and beat these players that just beat you. Many people have said; “If you can’t beat them, join em. It definitely feels that way now days where these players are joining each other and forming these super teams. The Warriors now have four players that are in the top 15 players in the NBA as of now. Most teams are lucky to have one player on their roster in the top 15.</p>
<p>Oklahoma City fans are very angry about Durant leaving and they have a right to be. The Thunder are the only professional sports team that they have in OKC. They love the Thunder and they had even more love for Kevin Durant. Thunder fans were stunned by his decision, not only because they thought he was loyal to the Thunder but also because it took less money to play for Golden State. Why not be the star of the city, have a great chance to win, and make more money?</p>
<p>As a Celtics fan, I was getting really excited of the idea that he might come to Boston.  The Celtics just signed Al Horford to a max deal, who is good friends with Durant.  The Celtics would be serious contenders if they added Durant to a team with Horford and Isiah Thomas.  The Celtics even sent the great Tom Brady to the meeting with Durant.  Unfortunately, the Celtics weren&#8217;t able to persuade him to the team.</p>
<p>Many people feel like only two teams can win the championship next year; Golden State or Cleveland.The same teams that played in the finals the previous two seasons. I love basketball but it sucks knowing that your team won’t have a chance against these superstar teams. I feel like more of a balance would make basketball more interesting and a better product. For now it looks like we will be seeing Golden State vs. Cleveland come next June.</p>

It&#8217;s all happening! Everything is awesome! It&#8217;s not a stretch to say that yesterday was the biggest day in the Groesbeck/Ainge/Stevens era in Boston. Danny was finally able to close that elusive big-name free agent, and Wyc was able to make good on his promise of &#8220;fireworks&#8221; that the fan base has been waiting on for what feels like centuries. Sure, $113 million over four years seems like a pretty penny, but with the money being thrown around this offseason and the huge cap increase on the horizon next season, Horford&#8217;s deal is actually somewhat of a bargain.</p>
<p>Horford&#8217;s game will fit seamlessly within the Brad Stevens system. He provides a much needed presence at the rim, and gives the C&#8217;s the go-to fourth quarter scoring option that they were sorely missing in last year&#8217;s playoffs. I cannot WAIT to see Isaiah and Horford running the pick and pop down the throats of the entire Eastern Conference come October.</p>
<p>By no means is Al Horford a perfect player, as evidence by his lackluster performance in the playoffs last season against these Celtics. He struggles defensively at times, particularly on the perimeter defending the pick and roll. The C&#8217;s team approach to defense should help to conceal some of Horford&#8217;s defensive deficiencies over the course of the season.</p>
<p>Hot damn, the Celtics are officially back. They finally landed a big name free-agent for the first time in the history of the franchise, (Go ahead look it up, I&#8217;ll wait) and they got a guy who WANTS to play in Boston. KD or not, this signing was a huge step in the right direction for this franchise. If TB12, Big Papi, and Julian Edleman have anything to do with it, Kevin Durant will be donning Celtic green next season in the city of champions. What a time to be a Celtics fan. What a time to be alive.</p>

Tom Brady, the GOAT, was in attendance at the meeting to help Danny Ainge in the recruitment of Durant. Also David Ortiz would have been there to help but he was busy nuking baseballs into the stands at Fenway.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Kevin Durant needs to come to Boston. The Celts just signed All-Star Al Horford to a four year 113 million dollar deal, Isaiah Thomas is our point guard, Brad Stevens is the head coach, and the team is only improving. If Durant signs with Boston, they immediately become a contender for the NBA Finals. This new big three of Thomas, Horford, and Durant would be absurd. Three legitimate elite players on the same team would do some damage next season so it only makes sense for Kevin to play for the Celtics and he has to know that.</p>
<p>One thing I hope Kevin understands is just how praised he will be in Boston. Players in the NBA know that Boston fans are different. We&#8217;re the most passionate fans out there and we are always there supporting our team through the good and the ugly. Al Horford told his Dad that part of the reason he signed with the Celtics is because of the fans. He knows that when he steps foot on the hardwood in the Garden wearing that green jersey, everyone is going to go nuts for him. If Kevin Durant does the same, he will become loved beyond belief in Boston and I know that for a fact. And hey it&#8217;s Boston&#8230;who doesn&#8217;t love it here?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what was said in Durant&#8217;s meeting with the Celtics but I do know one thing. Ainge most definitely told Durant that if he comes to Boston, he will become a Celtic legend, just like he told Isaiah. So please Kevin, make the right and best decision of your life and play for the best basketball franchise ever.</p>

<p>Al Horford has been recruited by Durant to come to OKC for some time now.  So The Celtics acquiring Horford makes the Celtics pitch that much more intriguing.  Horford is a top 20 player in the NBA, and with Isaiah already in green, The Celtics could put serious pressure on The Cavs if Durant is to choose Boston.  The fact that just hours after The meeting with The Celtics, Durant informed The Clippers he would not be signing with them is very interesting.</p>
<p>I am really starting to think that this could actually happen, and if it does, perhaps Brady&#8217;s number 12 should be retired in the rafters at the TD Garden.</p>

Clippers, The Thunder, and yes The Boston Celtics.</p>
<p>Think about this list, a team that just broke the regular season wins record, a team who recently won back to back championships, the best team of the last 10 plus years, a team that has Cp3 and Blake Griffin, and the team that drafted him.  This is the brass of the NBA (besides Cleveland).  Yes, The Celtics are more than likely number 6 on this list, however at least they are on it.  This list does not include the glamour of The Lakers, the bright lights of New York, it doesn&#8217;t include Houston were James Harden resides, and most surprisingly The Washington Wizards (Durant&#8217;s hometown) did not make the cut.</p>
<p>The Celtic&#8217;s just being on this list speaks volumes, this could single-handedly make Boston more intriguing to free agents.   For years Boston has been laying the groundwork to become a destination for free agents, and finally there is a glimmer of hope.  Hope that free agents can see the history of The Celtics, see the banners in the rafters, and see that this team with Brad Stevens has the potential to be a contender in the east.  The Celtics are also the only team that will meet with Durant that has room for 2 max contracts.</p>
<p>Do I think Durant will be in green next season?  No I don&#8217;t. However if the meeting goes well, and Durant signs a one year deal in OKC and tests free agency again in 2017 then I think there is a real chance it could happen.  Durant and his people hear the plan, Ainge executes it and next season Durant entertains the idea of Boston again.  Remember Celtic fans, Ainge started recruiting Kevin Garnett 3 years prior to trading for him.  Could we see history repeat itself?</p>
