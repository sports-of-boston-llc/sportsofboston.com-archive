The press conference started with statements and stories of gratitude and greatness in regards to the legendary 18-year veteran by Broncos President and CEO Joe Ellis, followed by Vice President of Denver football operations and legend in his own right John Elway, as well as current head coach Gary Kubiak. The speeches highlighted Manning&#8217;s greatness as a player in Indianapolis and Denver but also focused on his leadership, organization and community contribution, teamwork, and personal relationships he had with everyone involved with him in Denver. In a split screen on ESPN one could see the three aforementioned speakers giving examples of his illustriousness career in all capacities mentioned above with an emotional Peyton Manning doing his best to fight back tears.</p>
<p>When it was Peyton&#8217;s turn to speak he was as he usual is during interviews and media gatherings, all class. He had difficulty containing his emotions but did get through his speech which was full of career highlights and woes, stories of his first days on the NFL gridiron, and reflections on what specific moments in time meant to him both playing the game and interacting with players past and present in those moments.</p>
<p>Manning alluded to the Patriots on more than one occasion, the following is transcript from his speech: &#8220;I’m going to miss a steak dinner at St. Elmo&#8217;s in Indianapolis after a win. My battles with players named Lynch, Lewis, Thomas, Bruschi, Fletcher, Dawkins, Seau, Urlacher, Polamalu, Harrison, Woodson and Reed. And with coaches like Fisher, Ryan, Belichick, Kiffin, Phillips, Rivera, LeBeau, Crennel, Capers, Lewis, the late Jim Johnson, and so many more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ll miss that handshake with Tom Brady and I’ll miss the plane rides after a big win with 53 teammates standing in the aisles, laughing and celebrating during the whole flight. I’ll miss playing in front of so many great fans both at home and on the road. I’ll even miss the Patriots fans in Foxborough, and they should miss me because they sure did get a lot of wins off of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a player Peyton Manning was always someone New England fans loved to hate, but now it is time to give Peyton his due, to honor his greatness, and to respect his legacy as one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever put on the uniform.</p>
<p>Bill Belichick was quoted as saying: &#8220;For 18 years, we battled fiercely but regardless of each game&#8217;s outcome, I always walked off the field with the utmost appreciation for the highest level of competition in which those games were prepared for and played. Peyton&#8217;s immense contributions to the game reflect how genuinely passionate he is about it. I can honestly say that I never &#8216;enjoyed&#8217; our meetings, but the respect I have for Peyton Manning as a competitor was, and will likely remain, second to none.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Brady on the Monday Morning Quarterback Show had this to say: “What just happened, winning the Super Bowl in his last game, is a perfect way to end a career. But what he’s accomplished through all these years, what makes it so admirable, is the pressure he’s had on him his whole life. He was the highest-rated recruit in high school. He was the biggest quarterback in college football. He was the first pick in the draft. Who has lived up to the expectations year after year after year as well as Peyton? He’s done it so gracefully, so admirably. He set the standard for how to play the quarterback position.”</p>
<p>The drama provided over the years by the Brady vs Manning match ups has been unbelievable, for so many seasons these two quarterbacks were at the top of their game and their places in history will be forever intertwined. The level of preparation and surgically precise execution as well as competitive fire and Super Bowl contending teams made the contests some of the most well-played and exciting games of the era.</p>
<p>Peyton&#8217;s success can be measured with his statistics and accolades which include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>-Most all-time passing yards: 71,940</p>
<p>-Most all-time passing touchdowns: 539</p>
<p>-Most all-time career wins (regular season and post season): 200</p>
<p>-Most all-time regular season wins: 186 (Tied with Brett Farve)</p>
<p>-Most all-time game-winning drives: 56</p>
<p>-Most all-time Pro Bowl Selections: 14</p>
<p>-Most all-time 4,000+ yard seasons: 14</p>
<p>-Most single season passing yards: 5,477</p>
<p>-Most single season touchdowns: 55</p>
<p>-Most NFL MVP awards: 5-time winner</p>
<p>And the thing that one would imagine Manning is most proud of (even if Eli isn&#8217;t psyched about it) is being a 2-time Super Bowl Champion.</p>
<p>Manning has countless other statistics that are impressive if not the best all-time but what fans can appreciate about Manning is that he was a student of the game and he respected the game as much as anyone who has ever played it.</p>
<p>As much as New England fans have hated Peyton Manning over the years, there is no match up that has been looked forward to more. The conversation of &#8216;who is the better quarterback&#8217; in regards to Brady and Manning has been had in about every sports bar in New England and probably many places around the country. Wherever fans land on this is their own perspective from their own experiences but one thing is for sure both of them could make a case for the best all-time. There has rarely been a television event that is more must-see TV than Brady vs Manning, Patriots vs Colts/Broncos over the last 15 seasons.</p>
<p>Manning finished his speech with this to say: &#8220;When I look back on my NFL career, I’ll know without a doubt that I gave everything I had to help my teams walk away with a win. There were other players who were more talented but there was no one could out-prepare me and because of that I have no regrets.</p>
<p>&#8220;There’s a scripture reading, 2 Timothy 4:7: I have fought the good fight and I have finished the race. I have kept the faith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I’ve fought a good fight. I’ve finished my football race and after 18 years, it’s time. God bless all of you and God bless football.&#8221;</p>
<p>The final touch on the final day of his career was one of class, grace, and respect for the players, the fans, and the game of football.

The 11-time Pro Bowler was originally signed through 2017. Brady, 39 years of age this summer, was as sharp as ever this season and perhaps even better at avoiding the rush using pocket presence more than athletic ability. Tom took his fair share of hits with a porous offensive line (particular the physical beating in Denver) however has remained on the field consistently, playing in all 112 regular season games and 16 playoff games since 2008. Whether its the workouts or the kale smoothies, whatever he is doing is working to keep him healthy.</p>
<p>This season Brady completed 402 passes at a clip of 64.4% completion rate for 4,770 yards, 36 touchdowns and 7 picks, bottom line &#8211; he&#8217;s still got it. In fact, his numbers were actually slightly better this season than the previous three seasons across the board.</p>
<p>Not all the financial details have come out about what Brady will get paid the last two years of his deal but it is likely a restructuring that will allow the Patriots to resign key talents, particularly on the defensive side of the ball, keeping New England competitive going forward. Brady has done this in the past and has an incredible trust and bond with Bob Kraft and the organization.</p>
<p>This extension keeps the dynasty alive for four more years in New England with a fifth Super Bowl title in their sights. If Brady can stay healthy this would be a twenty year career in New England which may go down as the greatest all-time.</p>

Injuries have plagued Mayo over the last three seasons after an illustrious start to his career in which he was drafted with the 10th overall selection and named NFL defensive rookie of the year in 2008. Mayo amassed over 100 combined tackles in four of his first five seasons missing the mark by just five tackles in 2011.</p>
<p>The linebacker announced his likely retirement in an social media post titled &#8220;Retiring a Patriot&#8221; which read as follows: &#8220;After a lot of thought [Mayo&#8217;s wife] Chantel and I take this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude for what we consider a life changing event&#8230;..that of becoming a New England Patriot for the past 8 years. We are extremely grateful to &#8216;Thundercat&#8217; [Patriots owner Robert Kraft], [Patriots president] Jonathan [Kraft], the Kraft family, Coach [Bill] Belichick, the Pats organization, and the most amazing fans in contributing to these pages of our lives. As my family and I prepare for the future be sure that the Pats memories will always hold a special place in our hearts. #51 JMayo.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed that due to the financial burden of his contract Mayo was unlikely to be kept on with the organization. Mayo was originally set to earn $3.25 million in 2016 and then $6.75 million in 2017 before hitting free agency on top of a roster bonus set for next month.</p>
<p>Mayo was named a team captain for seasons 2009-2015 and was considered the leader of the linebacker core for most of his time in Foxborough. He ended the last three seasons on injured reserve playing only six games in each of the 2013 and 2014 seasons while playing all sixteen regular season games this year before getting hurt in the divisional round game against the Kansas City Chiefs.</p>
<p>Number fifty-one leaves behind a solid legacy of great leadership at the linebacker position and leaves New England in the capable hands of Dont&#8217;a Hightower, Jamie Collins and Jonathan Freeny.</p>

The win in Cleveland was likely the Celtics biggest win of the season, especially being on the road and playing the Cavaliers after they had come off a loss. It looked ugly early for the Celts Friday in Cleveland but they were able to hang in and keep it close in the first two quarters before gaining the lead in the second half. A balanced attack with Isaiah Thomas, Avery Bradley, Evan Turner, Tyler Zeller and Jared Sullinger all scoring in double figures helped to hold off the Cavaliers late game push. The grittiest play of the game came with the Celtics down two points with seconds left. A missed free throw from Evan Turner allowed for Marcus Smart, 6&#8217;4&#8243;, boxing out Timofey Mozgov, 7&#8217;1&#8243; to cause a scramble for the rebound that ultimately went out off the Cavaliers. This afforded the Celtics just the chance they needed and, on a broken play, Bradley gathered himself to knock down the game winning triple from the corner.</p>
<p>Rolling into Sunday winners of three straight and coming off dethroning the mighty King the C&#8217;s hung 46 points on Sacramento in the first quarter en route to the win. They were in control wire to wire despite a pesky performance from the Kings who made runs but were never able to recover from the 76 point first half performance of the Celtics.</p>
<p>Boston is now in sole possession of third place in the Eastern Conference behind Cleveland and Toronto, they are winners of four in a row and nine of their last ten. Celtics&#8217;s fans have reason to be excited with the wins and the way the team has continued to get better and play together. However, four and half games is all that separates the now third place Celtics and the ninth place Hornets. The C&#8217;s will need to continue to win with a tough schedule ahead. Boston not only has a slew of balanced Eastern Conference teams to play that will all be jockeying for position but still has a variety of tough Western Conference opponents to face after the All-Star break including Golden State, Oklahoma City, Los Angeles Clippers (and Lakers), and Memphis to name a few, those wins will not come easy.</p>
<p>For now Boston will head to Milwaukee to go for five straight wins against the Bucks who are losers of five straight, before coming home to face Doc Rivers and his 34-17 Clippers that have won seven of their last ten, doing so without Blake Griffin.</p>
<p>The Celtics should feel confident heading to the Midwest behind their Eastern Conference player of the week Isaiah Thomas who continues to put up numbers and help the C&#8217;s win games. His most recent weekly stat line to earn said honors goes like this: 20.3 points, 7 assists, 4.5 rebounds, and 1.3 steals over 33.6 minutes per game. With the C&#8217;s seeming to play their best basketball of the season coach Brad Stevens will continue to keep their feet on the ground and their eyes on the clipboard to hopefully finish the next two games strong before heading into All-Star weekend.</p>

The Cavs stand alone atop the Eastern Conference at 35-13 while Boston has mustered a 29-22 record, good for a third place tie with Atlanta. The Celtics have been winning games by putting up points, scoring over 100 points in 13 of their last 14 games, that ties them for fifth best in the NBA with San Antonio. Defensive intensity has also been a mainstay with the C&#8217;s giving up 100.3 points per game, not too shabby, and good for ninth best in the NBA, just behind Indiana and ahead of the Clippers.</p>
<p>Led by All-Star point guard Isaiah Thomas there is no doubt that the Celtics are on the rise and coming down the stretch run will hope to continue this push for home court advantage in the first round of the playoffs. It should be noted however that the competition that Boston has recently played is not near what they will face Friday night. The Celtics have essentially taken care of business and won games they are supposed to win to be considered a contender in Eastern Conference. The most notable recent victories have come over the Pistons, Pacers and Bulls who, if the regular season ended today, would be in the playoffs.</p>
<p>Cleveland on the other hand is in a different class than recent Celtics competitors. They are 7-3 in their last 10 games and have had marquee wins over San Antonio and the Clippers. Changes for Cleveland since they beat the Celtics 89-77 in December include the presence of Kyrie Irving who did not play as he was still rehabilitating a fractured knee cap and Cavs new head coach, ex-Celtics assistant coach Tyronn Lue, after the surprise firing of David Blatt.</p>
<p>Its likely going to be a difficult environment for the Celtics playing in Cleveland in front of a Friday night packed house. Not to mention LeBron James and the Cavs will be looking to rebound from a loss to the Hornets in a game where they did not face their opponents leading scorer Kemba Walker. Instead they were torched by Jeremy Lin, that&#8217;s right Jeremy Lin who hung 24 points and eight dimes on Cleveland, sending them too defeat. Expect a fired up crowd and a Cavaliers team trying to fend off a second straight loss as the Celtics try to keep their string of winning ways alive at Quicken Loans Arena.</p>
<p>Key match ups to watch will be Isaiah Thomas, who is coming into the game scoring 21.4 points per game to go with 6.6 assists, and Kyrie Irving who is averaging 17.2 points per contest. However it is somewhat unlikely they will actually defend one another all the time as Brad Stevens will rotate Marcus Smart and Avery Bradley onto Irving to stifle his attack with their tenacious on ball defense. Another match up to watch will be Jae Crowder doing his best to slow down the LeBron James freight train and the carousel of Celtics bigs trying to rebound with Kevin Love, Timofey Mozgov and Tristan Thompson.</p>
<p>If the Celtics are able to score over 100 points, as they have been consistently doing, and are able to keep the Cavs off the offensive glass for easy put backs, they will have a shot of dethroning the King and his Cavs in their own castle. On the other hand, if the Celtics are forced to grind out a poor shooting performance like the game back in December they will surely struggle against the defending Eastern Conference Champs.</p>
<p>Its a potential playoff preview of two teams heading in the right direction, the Cavs under the new direction of Tyronn Lue, and the red hot C&#8217;s playing their best basketball under Brad Stevens. The Q Arena should be rocking on Friday night and Celtics fans will be able to see how this improved Boston team measures up against the likely number one seed in the east!</p>

Thomas joins a stacked group of guards including Dwayne Wade, Kyle Lowry, John Wall, Jimmy Butler and DeMar DeRozan. NBA coaches vote on the reserve All-Stars which, some may say, adds to the merit of the selection as fans can tend to lean toward names and popularity (see Lakers representation below).</p>
<p>Thomas has been an on and off the court leader for a young Boston team. He has provided an offensive spark scoring 21.6 points per game and dishing out 6.6 assists per night showing he can be a play-maker as well as a scorer. Isaiah has made an impact in the win column with the Celtics going 46-31 since he arrived in the lineup on Feb. 22, 2015, many will remember a much more dismal record prior to his landing in Boston. Under coach Brad Stevens, Thomas has helped lead the Celtics to a 26-21 record, good for 5th place in a balanced Eastern Conference. Boston is in good position to jockey for a home playoff coming out of the All-Star break and down the stretch.</p>
<p>Quick, fearless, and deceptively strong are some of the adjectives you may hear when people talk about Thomas. He is able to knock down the 3-point shot but makes his money pushing the ball in transition, weaving through the lane to make plays for teammates or going hard to the tin to score at the basket and draw fouls. His teammates and the fans in Boston love him as he embodies the spirit of a rising Celtics squad.</p>
<p>Thomas&#8217; teammates and opponents for the 2016 All-Star Game are listed below:</p>
<h3>Eastern Conference All-Stars</h3>
<p><b>Starters</b><br />
Carmelo Anthony, New York<br />
Paul George, Indiana<br />
LeBron James, Cleveland<br />
Kyle Lowry, Toronto<br />
Dwyane Wade, Miami</p>
<p><b>Reserves</b><br />
Jimmy Butler, Chicago<br />
John Wall, Washington<br />
Andre Drummond, Detroit<br />
Chris Bosh, Miami<br />
DeMar DeRozan, Toronto<br />
Paul Millsap, Atlanta<br />
Isaiah Thomas, Boston</p>
<h3>Western Conference All-Stars</h3>
<p><b>Starters</b><br />
Kobe Bryant, L.A. Lakers<br />
Stephen Curry, Golden State<br />
Kevin Durant, Oklahoma City<br />
Kawhi Leonard, San Antonio<br />
Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City</p>
<p><b>Reserves</b><br />
Draymond Green, Golden State<br />
Klay Thompson, Golden State<br />
Chris Paul, L.A. Clippers<br />
James Harden, Houston<br />
DeMarcus Cousins, Sacramento<br />
LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio<br />
Anthony Davis, New Orleans</p>
<p>A star-studded field with both teams having plenty of fire power should make for the usual high-scoring event that will hopefully turn into a game in the fourth quarter as it has tended to the past few years. The talent level in the Western Conference is insane, the only thing that is likely to slow those guys down is Kobe&#8217;s number of field goal attempts (sorry Kobe, you are not retired so I can&#8217;t appreciate you yet).</p>
<p>Thomas can look forward to getting some minutes against the best in the west but its hard to imagine anyone can get excited about guarding the dazzling Steph Curry or the crafty Chris Paul on the perimeter and whoever is in the way of Russell Westbrook during the All-Star game is asking to end up a poster. Fortunately for Thomas, and probably for most of these offensive-minded players, the All-Star game is about 3-pointers, dunks and behind the back passes for at least three quarters, defense starts to seep in around the same time as the competitive nature of these individuals takes hold.</p>
<p>The Celtics are proud to be sending Thomas to the 65th NBA All-Star game in Toronto, no one deserves it more, if only I had the authority to give a Tommy Point he&#8217;d get two from me!</p>
<p>Congratulations to Isaiah!</p>

Blame the O-Line, blame the kicker, blame the play calling from McDaniels, even blame Tom Brady and the ducks he threw up for grabs resulting in two picks. For me, personally, I blame Bill Belichick and Josh McDaniel&#8217;s arrogant play calling in Miami earning the Patriots a week 17 loss and sending them to Denver for the AFC Championship rather than hosting it. The Patriots ran the ball 27 times for 70 yards, averaging 2.6 yards per carry. With multiple 3rd and long plays the coaching staff elected to run the ball and then punt. Only when it was too late did they allow Brady to throw and then the whole plan to protect Brady and establish a run game was out the window with the Dolphins getting pressure on every pass play, running through the Pats porous offensive line and leaving Brady tits up in the backfield for a good portion of the second half. Whoa, now that I got that out, I think I can move on.</p>
<p>The season is over and the grieving process has begun. As part of this process Tom Brady issued a handwritten letter to fans via Facebook. In the letter Brady thanks the fans for all the support over the season and states his pride in calling New England his home. A nice touch from Brady in a tough time for the team and New England fans. The AFC Championship was difficult to watch, with an un-Patriot-like performance allowing for mistakes, turnovers, and lack of execution. Outside of the defense from New England, this will not be a game with many positive things to look back on. Brady and the Pats never gave up, with big conversions down the field and then ultimately in the endzone to Gronkowski there was a glimmer of hope at the end but fell a 2-point conversion short.</p>
<p>Hopefully next season New England fans will once again see the well-oiled machine known as the Patriots offense with a better protection plan for TB12. One thing is for certain, New England will have a new offensive line coach, and, most would imagine, a differently looking offensive line to start next season.</p>
<p>On the upside for Patriot Nation, Tom Brady will return next year with a top notch core of receiving weapons, again be the favorite in the AFC East and a threat to go to Super Bowl 51. That cannot be said for Denver, this may be the last run for Ol&#8217; Peyton Manning. So enjoy the Super Bowl Pat&#8217;s fans, no need to yell at the TV, or holler at whoever is reaching for nachos, blocking the game on a key third down, just enjoy the beer and truck commercials and watch the game like a casual sports fan, you know, like people from outside of New England.</p>

The Patriots and Broncos have provided fans with some great games over the past few seasons. The championship game brings not just the top two seeded teams in the AFC together but also the top two quarterbacks of this era of football to face each other once again in what is likely the last Brady vs Manning post season match up. With the high stakes of a Super Bowl appearance on the line, the hype of a Brady vs Manning contest, and the pairing of Gronk, Edelman, and Amendola vs the Denver secondary led by Harris Jr, Talib, and the physically dangerous T.J. Ward has also led to some entertaining banter between the teams.</p>
<p>In a SportsCenter interview Tuesday Chris Harris Jr. was asked about stopping Rob Gronkowski, his response was the following: &#8220;You gotta hit him low, man. Hit him in his knees. That&#8217;s the best chance you got of hitting him.&#8221; As many know Gronkowski has had his share of injuries, particularly to his knee dating back to the 2013 ACL and MCL tear precipitated by T.J. Ward&#8217;s untimely contact to the knee at the exact moment Gronk planted his foot in the ground. The hit jarred open the debate of low hits being clean hits as Gronk was sidelined with the season ending injury. Another scare for the big tight end happened on a snowy night this November in the lost to Denver where a shoulder to knee appeared much worse than it actually was and had Gronk and all of New England holding their breath. To be fair to Chris Harris Jr tackling Gronkowski low may be the only way to drag him to the ground. He is too big and strong for most defensive backs to pull down alone and, with speed to out run linebackers if able to get loose, is one of the best yards after contact receivers in the league. Whether Gronkowski actually took offense to the comment about hitting him low or just sounded off in anticipation of the biggest game of the season Gronk responded in a very Gronk way with this double entendre via twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/PaetyWinant">https://twitter.com/PaetyWinant</a>. Without diving into the implied meaning of the duel-edged comment it is clear to see Gronkowski fans and followers will likely have a laugh at the expense of an unappreciative Broncos squad, as tensions between the teams continue to rise heading into Sunday.</p>
<p>With the history of these two post-season giants, a quarterback rivalry dating back over a decade, Gronkowski&#8217;s history and Ward&#8217;s presence the comments made by Harris and response from Gronk have gained a lot of traction in the build up to Sunday&#8217;s game. Ultimately this is probably the least serious thing that will be discussed this week leading up to the game but it is entertaining to see the two sides go at each other and for those following along to have a laugh as the Broncos now have some great white board material. After all it is going to almost necessary as the week rolls on to talk about something other than Brady vs Manning statistics and which analyst picks who as the best quarterback of the era. At this point both signal callers know that success is measured in rings and both will be playing for a chance to get their teams to another Super Bowl and solidify an already established greatness.</p>

The Chiefs were dominant on defense and forced a shaky Houston offense into a borderline embarrassing performance. Kansas City was able to get after Houston quarterback Brian Hoyer forcing a fumble and four interceptions. Despite the pressure put on by the Chiefs defensive line Hoyer was also his own worst enemy making terrible decisions, particularly in the red zone. Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith and the KC offense was efficient against a tough Houston defensive that held them to just six points in the first half however they led 13-0 at the break thanks to a 106-yard kickoff returned for a touchdown by Knile Davis to start the game. In the second half the Chiefs were able to open up the lead as Hoyer and the Texans continued to shoot themselves in the foot. Kansas City, playing on the road, was not phased by the 71,000 screaming  fans or defensive stud J.J. Watt who they avoided with quick hitting pass plays, screens, sweeps and extra manpower. Alex Smith finished the day 17 of 22 for 190 yards with a touchdown and a rare interception, coach Andy Reid&#8217;s experience and game plan worked perfectly. Kansas City is now riding an 11-game win streak coming into Foxborough for next week&#8217;s divisional round playoff match up and should be as confident as ever.</p>
<p>One key problem for the Chiefs is the status of star receiver Jeremy Macklin who has been a go to guy for Alex Smith all season. Macklin suffered and injury to his ACL late in the second half of the win in Houston and did not return. He is due to have an MRI today to assess the extent of the damage, KC fans will be crossing their fingers in hopes that Macklin does not have a tear in that right knee. Maclin caught 87 passes for 1,088 yards and eight touchdowns during the regular season. Also banged up coming into the game against the Patriots will be Tamba Hali with a thumb and knee injury who had limited action against the Texans but is a key figure in the pass rush for KC that will be essential to getting pressure on Tom Brady, the formula for disrupting the flow of the Patriots offense. Linebacker Justin Houston also seemed to tweak his knee which has been a lingering injury for him this season causing him to miss five games.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2016/01/10/pats-draw-streaking-chiefs-for-divisional-round-playoff/">Pats Draw Streaking Chiefs For Divisional Round Playoff</a> (519 words)</p>

With Dion Lewis and LaGarrette Blount out with season ending injuries the once dynamic combo of speed and power has been replaced by special team players and practice squad promotions. Jackson will add depth, experience, power running, ball security, and, for the Patriots, will hopefully transition to the offensive system quickly having played under offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels in 2011 in St. Louis.</p>
<p>With all the injuries the Pats have suffered Brandon Bolden, a key player in the special teams game who has always taken limited snaps at running back, has become the featured back in the New England offensive. He has been accompanied by the speedy James White who is able to play a vital role in the passing game. However with only two backs on the active roster New England was forced to promote a practice squad player for Sunday&#8217;s game against the Titans. Joey Iosefa, a 247-pound fullback who had been cut by Tampa Bay and later picked up by New England, made an impact with 51 yards on 14 carries and one big run in which he bulldozed Tennessee cornerback Coty Sensabaugh.</p>
<p>With New England so thin in the backfield, and with the playoffs and cold weather ahead, signing a veteran back like Steven Jackson looks like a solid move, although Jackson hasn&#8217;t played since being released by Atlanta in February. When in a Falcons uniform last season he averaged 3.7 yards per carry in 15 games. The three time Pro Bowler has churned out 11,388 yards over the course of 11 seasons in the NFL playing for Atlanta and St. Louis before that. Now at 32 years old the Patriots hope he has a little left in the tank to propel their running game forward. At 12-2 New England has secured a first round bye and has a great shot at the number one overall seed in the AFC. Over the next few weeks McDaniels and running back coaches will have the opportunity to work with Jackson and integrate him into the current carousel of backs.</p>
<p>If Jackson is able to get on the field quickly this would mean Bolden could get back to his special teams duties with limited touches at running back if needed. It would seem that the apparently explosive James White isn&#8217;t going anywhere as he has become a integral part of the Patriots offensive attack, particularly on passing downs. His combination of pass catching and ability to make plays when getting the ball in space gives back a little of the Dion Lewis dimension to the offensive.</p>
<p>The Patriots also recently signed running back Montee Ball to the practice squad, the Denver Broncos 2013 second round draft pick. Ball was productive in his rookie season with 120 carries for 559 yards and four touchdowns. In 2014 a groin injury sidelined him for much of the season before he was ultimately released.</p>
<p>If Jackson can get on the field this Sunday he will face a defense that is second in the NFL against the run for a better-than-expected Jets team currently fighting for a wild card spot.</p>
