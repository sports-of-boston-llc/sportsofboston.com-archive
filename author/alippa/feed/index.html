The Red Sox found a saving grace in the Los Angeles Dodgers and their new ownership led by Magic Johnson, who were dying to make a big time impact to show their fans that they mean business and in the process, took more than $250 million in salaries.Â The Red Sox had been sinking deeper and deeper into obscurity and the Dodgers basically threw them a life preserver.</p>
<p>After two disappointing seasons in a row, the Red Sox needed a fresh start and more importantly, financial flexibility. Once the trade happened, the Red Sox predictably fell off the map without Gonzalez in the heart of their order, but more interestingly, the Dodgers struggled as well. Gonzalez struggled being back on the West Coast and the Dodgers failed to make the playoffs.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2012/12/01/looking-back-red-sox-dumping-gonzalez-crawford-beckett-still-a-good-move/">Looking Back: Red Sox Dumping Gonzalez, Crawford, Beckett Still a Good Move?</a> (664 words)</p>

<p>But as the old saying goes, games are not exactly won on paper.</p>
<p>When it comes to building teams, there are more than just past statistics that need to be considered.
