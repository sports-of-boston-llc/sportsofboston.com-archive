				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the functions of a league is to ensure that the league has created a schedule that entertains fans, but also draws as much money as possible. So, it is no surprise that the NFL wants to expand to more games, given that a large percentage of their games sell out as is. An increased amount of games means the league could negotiate new TV contracts with increased television fees. However, I think that a move would be a short-sighted disaster.</p>
<p>One of the great things about the NFL is that the schedule doesn&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s too long as a fan. Training camps start in the summer, preseason games are at the end of the summer, the season is September through December and then the playoffs begin. By the end of the first week of February, the ups and downs of rooting for your football team can be stored away for a few months. Anytime a season gets longer, a fan is more likely to be burned out. With less down time between the end of a season and beginning of the next, there is the risk that a fan could have less time to let the stresses of caring about their favorite team disappear.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/11/20/the-nfl-should-not-expand-to-18-game-seasons/">The NFL Should Not Expand to 18-Game Seasons</a> (309 words)</p>

(Photo from courant.com)" ></a><p>Seeing as there&#8217;s less than a month left to the season, we can begin to predict what the award winners are going to look like. The one I&#8217;d like to take a look at is the AL MVP race, and this is because it will divide old school baseball fans and more sabermetrically-inclined fans for who should win. Positional valuation fun will be <strong>ALL</strong> over this one. I will list the Top 5 candidates, in the order that I foresee the writers voting for them. Also, at the end, I will list a few other candidates I see receiving votes. (I should note, when I mention leading the league in any rate stats, it&#8217;s for qualified players only).</p>
<h2>1. Mark Teixeira, 1B, New York Yankees</h2>
<p>Yes, there&#8217;s just too many traditional minded writers who get the right to vote still. Not to discount at all what Teixeira has done. He&#8217;s second in the league in HRs as of now and since Carlos Pena is done for the season, he has a good chance of leading the league at the end of the season. He will be one of the top players in RBI thanks to the lineup around him and he&#8217;ll have over 100 runs scored as well, for that very reason. He plays a very solid first base and voters will remember his defensive reputation from seasons past, even if he looks poor in the last few weeks. With the Yankees on pace to win over 100 games, it&#8217;s going to be too hard for these voters not to pencil him in.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/09/08/handicapping-the-al-mvp-race/">Handicapping the AL MVP Race</a> (521 words)</p>

However, for the former Atlanta Brave, the results were far from optimal, with only some initial success. Pitching for the first time in his career in the American League, and in the toughest division in baseball, Smoltz posted his worst ERA since his rookie year.  To analyze what the future holds for Smoltz, we need to first analyze what happened during his stint with the Red Sox.</p>
<h2>2009 Season</h2>
<h3>The Bad</h3>
<p>Not having the easy out (the pitcher in NL lineups) in the lineup, Smoltz posted his lowest strikeout rate since 1991 and the fifth worst strikeout numbers of his illustrious career. He also posted the worst home run rate and WHIP of his career. Part of that came from pitching in front of a Red Sox defense that is one of their worst in recent years. Poor defense contributed to him allowing an unlucky .391 batting average on balls in play. Another issue for Smoltz was that he posted his lowest ground ball to fly ball ratio of his career.</p>
<p>The AL East is home to ballparks more conducive to home runs than the NL East, and that was even true <strong>before</strong> the new ballparks in New York. If you allow more fly balls and in parks more conducive to the home run, you&#8217;re bound to have some trouble. Sure enough, Smoltz&#8217;s home run per fly ball rate was the highest it&#8217;s been in his career at 14.8%. He also posted his lowest first strike percentage since Baseball Info Solutions began tracking the stat in 2002.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/08/17/what-remains-for-john-smoltz/">What Remains for John Smoltz</a> (287 words)</p>

It can read the speed of the ball and the spin of the ball. It&#8217;s how MLB.com&#8217;s gameday is able to show those nifty pitch paths.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Quite possibly the most season-altering move a team could make would be trading for an ace before the deadline to fulfill a hole in the starting rotation. We saw the benefits of that for Milwaukee last year when they acquired C.C. Sabathia and rode his arm into the playoffs. Well, fortunately for us rumor mill enthusiasts, Toronto announced they would listen to offers for Roy Halladay. Now while they won&#8217;t go out of their way to send out their No. 1 starter, the Jays will make a trade if they get what they&#8217;re asking for. So, I&#8217;m going to try and determine if any teams will get the deal done this year.</p>
<p>The two obvious competitors for any high profile name are the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox.  Two of the richest teams in the game (Boston and New York) always tend to be after the top player. However, the Blue Jays are averse to dealing within the division. Halladay has a full year left on his contract after this season and the Blue Jays don&#8217;t want him to be the reason they can&#8217;t compete in the division next year. Plus, the fans in Toronto are already struggling to find a reason to cheer the team and trading him within the division would make for an easy fan defection route.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/07/20/the-roy-halladay-trade-sweepstakes/">The Roy Halladay Trade Sweepstakes</a> (860 words)</p>

The other night I was trying to catch highlights of an Albert Pujols home run and Baseball Tonight was trying to push the meme of Tim Wakefield for the All Star Team just because he&#8217;s made so many starts for the Red Sox over the years. Really, that&#8217;s the qualification these days?</p>
<p>Well, I guess the Yankees better send over their petition to get Andy Pettitte on the team then, as well.  Of course, the best players in each league will not all make it due to injury, pitching schedules, and the cockamamie one player from every team rule. Boy is that going to suck this year when they need a player from Washington.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;d prefer to title this &#8220;How the Yankees have had bad timing against Boston.&#8221; Yes, it&#8217;s well documented that the Yankees have lost all eight meetings so far against the Red Sox. But, I think we need a further examination as to why the Red Sox have won all eight games to see if we can expect this dominance to continue.</p>
<p>The first meeting was at Fenway and the Yankees lost 5-4. Both teams had a lot of baserunners as the Yankees had 21 and the Red Sox had 19. The Yankees had a two-run lead in the bottom of the 9th when Mariano Rivera blew the save. Mariano&#8217;s fastball was 1-2 mph slower in this game and his control was off as well. Also of note is that Alex Rodriguez was not playing this game as he was still rehabbing his hip.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/06/22/why-the-red-sox-have-beaten-the-yankees/">Why the Red Sox Have Beaten the Yankees</a> (685 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that we are approximately two and a half months in to the baseball season, each player&#8217;s statistics have begun to hold a little bit more weight. Thus, we can begin to analyze some of the more unlikely numbers of the season so far.</p>
<h3>Adam Lind</h3>
<p>Tied with Freddy Sanchez for the lead in doubles, Adam Lind is off to a scorching start. He&#8217;s always been a very highly rated prospect, but his playing time in Toronto the past two years produced rather underwhelming results. Now, at 25 years old, he has put it together at the major league level. He&#8217;s increased his doubles rate, home run rate and his walk rate. He&#8217;s part of the reason for Toronto&#8217;s hot start.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/06/15/surprises-of-the-baseball-season/">Surprises of the Baseball Season</a> (690 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After checking out the new stadium in the Bronx I wanted to check out the new home of the New York Mets. Now, my latest chance to see a game at Citi Field was going to be to wait until the Giants came into town and to buy tickets to see Tim Lincecum make the Mets look foolish. Fortunately, for Mets fans at least, my first trip to Citi Field came much earlier than that as I got to see them in an outing against the Washington Nationals, a perfectly boring team for the Mets to face so that I could wander around the stadium.</p>
<p>For the game, I got to sit in my friend&#8217;s seats in left field on the lowest deck. His seats are seven rows from the field and they were actually a great view. I did not mind viewing a game with a similar view to the outfielders. The seats were similar to the ones at the New Yankee Stadium, except they had the ridges of old stadium seats, unlike the seats at the New Yankee Stadium. Also, as with every new stadium, there were cupholders on the backs of the arms of the seats in front.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/06/08/citi-field-my-first-impression/">Citi Field: My First Impression</a> (786 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the Phoenix Coyotes announced their impending bankruptcy and that the team would be sold, I don&#8217;t think anyone could have imagined that the Coyotes would suddenly be the source of excitement for the first time since it was announced Wayne Gretzky was going to be coach of the team.</p>
<p>However, Jim Balsillie&#8217;s intent to buy the team and move them to Ontario was not a move Gary Bettman, the NHL commissioner, approved of. He wants to keep the team in Phoenix and not abandon a market that he has spent many years trying to build up. Plus, the issue of the NHL having funded the Coyotes&#8217; finances for most of the past year meant that Bettman felt he could determine the future location of the franchise.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/06/01/nhl-vs-balsillie-case-has-large-implications/">NHL vs. Balsillie Case Has Large Implications</a> (205 words)</p>
