(Getty Images: Stephen Dunn)" ></a><p>This past decade has been good to us Red Sox fans, as weird as that is to say. Up until Game 4 of the ALCS, it looked like it was going to be another 10 years of let downs. It turns out, we were wrong. With two World Championships, the Red Sox have truly been one of the best franchises in all of sports this past decade, and the only way to honor those players is to name the 2000-2009 Boston Red Sox All-Decade Team.</p>
<h2>Catcher – Jason Varitek</h2>
<p>There is little competition for Jason Varitek in this category. Varitek has been the starting catcher for the Red Sox for almost the entire decade. Varitek put up strong numbers for the Red Sox over the last ten seasons, especially for a catcher, hitting .257, belting 148 home runs, and driving in 596 runs. His best seasons were 2003 through 2005, where he hit a total of 65 home runs and had 228 RBI with a .283 batting average.</p>
<p>Varitek’s greatest strength, however, came from behind the plate. He is well known for his ability to control the game from the catcher’s position. Vartiek has caught four no-hitters in his career, all coming this decade. The first was Hideo Nomo in 2001, then Derek Lowe in 2002, followed by Clay Buchholz in 2007, and finally Jon Lester in 2008. Even with his career coming to an end, and his numbers dropping off, Jason Varitek has been an outstanding player for this organization this past decade.</p>

It is usually the professional athletes that we idolize. We buy their jerseys and adore them until management cuts them loose. As quickly as they go, another professional athlete comes into the picture and they become our new favorite.</p>
<p>The same thing happens on the college front. Whether it is Boston College, Boston University, Northeastern, Harvard, or even my school, Bentley University, players come and go every four years. These athletes come into our city, attend school and play their hearts out as long as they can possibly remain a student.</p>
<p>There are a lot of local alumni succeeding in professional sports today. We know how some are doing because they are succeeding at the highest level, such as Matt Ryan. However there are many players who we forget about because they either play on a small market team or they are stuck in the minor leagues. It’s not anyone’s fault that we stop following these players. Every year a new recruiting class enrolls at local colleges and become the new generation of student-athletes gracing our campuses.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/12/23/alumni-update-nathan-gerbe/">Alumni Update: Nathan Gerbe</a> (531 words)</p>

This can be relieving for some players, who get traded away from cellar dwellers and sent to contenders. Some players are promising young prospects who get traded away because a big name veteran is on the trading block. Then, there are players who are involved in every rumor known just because “experts” think a team is making a run at a high profile player.</p>
<p>As followers of the Red Sox, we hear these rumors quite a bit more than most teams. The Sox seem to always be ready to make a move in order to provide an instant upgrade for their lineup. When SoB&#8217;s Mike, George, and myself went to a recent Reebok event, we spoke to three players who all had connections to the Red Sox organization. We spoke with former prospects David Murphy and Kelly Shoppach, as well as starting pitcher Clay Buchholz.</p>
<p>Each of those players has also been involved with trade rumors. Shoppach and Murphy have both been traded away from the organization. Buchholz, as we all know, has been talked about in nearly every trade rumor surrounding the Red Sox. Trade rumors surrounding baseball players really does not affect us as fans, but what goes through the players’ heads as they hear their name brought up on ESPN?(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/12/06/life-on-the-trade-block/">Life on the Trade Block</a> (1,214 words)</p>

<p>This year, the National Football League will feature three games. The Green Bay Packers will visit the Detroit Lions, the Oakland Raiders will visit the Dallas Cowboys, and the Denver Broncos will host the New York Giants.</p>
<p>The NFL used to only play two games on Thanksgiving, dating back to the AFL/NFL merger, with the Lions and Cowboys each hosting a game. Not missing a chance to make a little more money, the NFL added a third game in 2006 during prime time. That proved to be a good decision, however, because it gave everyone a chance to catch at least one game on Thanksgiving.<br />

I mentioned my planning to write this article to my roommate and I was met with instant dismissal. I would, however, like to point out that I am not advocating Theo’s firing, or even expressing a dislike for him. This article is merely meant to show readers that Theo is not as great of a General Manager as we all assume.</em></p>
<p>Theo Epstein has been the General Manager for the Boston Red Sox since 2002 (or if you count his brief resignation, since 2006). When Epstein was hired, he became the youngest GM in baseball history at the ripe old age of 28. Since his employment as GM, the Boston Red Sox have won two World Series titles, been to four AL Championship Series, and captured one AL East Championship.</p>
<p>Much of this success of the Red Sox comes from the new attitude brought in by owners John Henry, Tom Werner, and Larry Lucchino. They came in and brought a new attitude of winning to the Boston Red Sox organization. The Sox began to rival the Yankees in more than just the standings. The payroll for the Red Sox increased to a point where they had the second highest payroll, right behind the Evil Empire themselves.</p>
<p>This is where Theo comes in. As we have seen with the Yankees under the George Steinbrenner administration, spending lots of money on high profile free agents can help “buy” a World Series. It was not long until Theo was given a pretty hefty payroll to work with as well.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/11/10/should-theo-epstein-be-on-the-hot-seat/">Should Theo Epstein Be on the Hot Seat?</a> (2,361 words)</p>

<p>Last season, the Celtics again entered the campaign without a true backup point guard (Cassell was on the team, but he never suited up). After disgruntled point guard Stephon Marbury finally worked out a buyout with the Knicks, the Celtics swooped in and signed him. Marbury was not the saving grace that the team hoped he would be, and the Celtics fell to the Magic in the second round of the playoffs.</p>
<p>For the third season in a row, the Celtics will not have a true backup for Rajon Rondo. The team has some options in-house, and there may be some options out there for the Celtics to pick up. So where does the team go from here?(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/10/30/grading-the-celtics-backup-point-guard-options/">Grading the Celtics Backup Point Guard Options</a> (1,330 words)</p>
