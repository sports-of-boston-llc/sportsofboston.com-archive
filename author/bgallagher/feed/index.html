It might be easy to say that it&#8217;s not surprising that Buchholz struggled against a Rangers team with the best record in the American League, especially with how Buchholz&#8217;s season has gone this year. But John Farrell used his faith in Buchholz to justify not bringing up a reliever from Pawtucket a night after <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8185&amp;position=P">Steven Wright</a> did not make it out of the fifth inning, and two nights after <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=3184&amp;position=P">David Price</a> didn&#8217;t make it out of the third. Most Red Sox fans already knew that faith was misguided, and were not surprised when Buchholz allowed the first six batters he faced to reach base, putting giving the Rangers an immediate lead they would not give up. Buchholz also walked more batters (5) than he struck out (3), further illustrating why he was demoted to the bullpen earlier in the season. Sadly the Red Sox find themselves thin on options as far as starting pitching is concerned, but there really is no reason to send Buchholz back out for another start. He has had more than his fair share of chances in Boston, and he has proven that the only thing he can be counted on to do is under-perform.</p>
<p>A few more notes from Sunday&#8217;s game:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=10607&amp;position=OF">Bryce Brentz</a> went 2-for-3 with a solo homer, the first of his Major League career. It will be interesting to see if the Red Sox try to get Brentz some playing time in Left Field going forward, as his bat could be starting to heat up. His main competition in Left, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=10700&amp;position=OF">Ryan LaMarre</a>, has done absolutely nothing with the bat since coming up from Pawtucket, so there should be plenty of playing time available for whoever is performing at the moment.</li>

That Groome fell to the Red Sox with the 12th pick is an example of how the Red Sox should be approaching the draft. While the draft pool system makes it harder to just throw big signing bonuses at amateur players, there are still cases like Groome where a team like the Red Sox can take advantage of their spending capacity and add a premier talent.</p>

Kelly lasted 4.2 innings while allowing 5 runs on 9 hits and 3 walks. Kelly did also strike out 8 Blue Jays in his outing, which provides the basis for confusion. The initial reaction is that Kelly allowed too many runs in too short a time frame, but seeing the high strikeout total gives pause for reconsideration.</p>
<p>Kelly&#8217;s return was met with solid optimism, as he had been racking up an impressive strikeout total in Triple-A Pawtucket while on a rehab assignment as well. It is easy to think that a Major League quality pitcher should easily strike out a good number of Triple-A hitters, but that is not a guarantee. It is encouraging to see that Kelly has carried the strikeout ability to the Major League level, because it will allow Kelly to get out of tough situations, especially if he keeps allowing baserunners at a similar rate to his last start.</p>

It was clear that Betts is a difference maker after he was a 4.8-win player in his rookie season, where he hit .291/.341/.479 with 10 DRS in centerfield. So putting him atop the Red Sox lineup again in 2016 was a pretty easy decision for John Farrell (not that it&#8217;s stopped him before). It has been easy to forget about Betts this season given the star power that surrounds him in the lineup, but the speedy leadoff man has actually been better so far in 2016 than he was in 2015, but in a somewhat surprising way.</p>
<p>Betts spent 2015 being a quality leadoff man, combining a solid 7% walk rate with a very good 12.5% strikeout rate for a hybrid average/on-base approach based on putting the ball in play and using his speed. This seems like a smart approach for a player with his kind of athleticism, especially when he hits directly in front of <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8370&amp;position=2B">Dustin Pedroia</a>, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=12161&amp;position=SS">Xander Bogaerts</a>, and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=745&amp;position=DH">David Ortiz</a>. And what was even better, this was all done with a reasonable .310 BABIP, so we already knew that a high level of production was sustainable for Betts.</p>

Rather, it really is worth asking when the Red Sox are going to finally part with John Farrell as their manager and allow Torey Lovullo to take over. It is a question of when, not if, because Farrell is clearly on his last legs as manager. In fact, the Red Sox likely would have relieved Farrell of his duties in the offseason were it not for some extenuating circumstances with his health. Lovullo had several chances to interview for managerial roles in the offseason, but he stayed as bench coach because the Red Sox convinced him that he was next in line to take over the dugout. But regardless of who the replacement is, it is time for Farrell to go; he is clearly in over his head and the Red Sox need leadership from a manager who can win.</p>
<p>It really has been stunning how Farrell&#8217;s in-game managing has fallen off of a cliff in 2016. Not that he was a very good in-game manager in the first place, but there have been multiple occasions in 2016 where Farrell has left literally everyone in the ballpark wondering what he is thinking.</p>

Spring Training is usually more of a fleeting tease than legitimate action, but there if one pays attention there are still lessons to be learned. With that in mind, we&#8217;ve come up with a list of nine items/storylines to keep track of down in Ft. Myers (we&#8217;ve intentionally excluded <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=5409&amp;position=3B" target="_blank">Pablo Sandoval</a>&#8216;s weight problem, because that should surprise no one).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Other options at Third Base</strong> &#8211; Sandoval&#8217;s conditioning and physical shape are always going to be a problem, so no one should have been shocked when he showed up looking like he had just eaten <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8370&amp;position=2B" target="_blank">Dustin Pedroia</a> for breakfast and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=9345&amp;position=2B/3B/OF" target="_blank">Brock Holt</a> for lunch. Sandoval&#8217;s contract also essentially makes the starting job at Third his to lose, but there is a possibility that he takes himself out of the running for everyday playing time if his performance falls off a cliff. It would be interesting to know who might stand to benefit from more available playing time at the hot corner should the need arise. The early guess would most likely be Holt, due to his experience at the position, although <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=11982&amp;position=1B" target="_blank">Travis Shaw</a> saw limited action at Third last season so he at least has experience there as well.</li>
<li><strong>How will the bridge to <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=11982&amp;position=1B" target="_blank">Craig Kimbrel</a> be composed</strong> &#8211; We already know that the Red Sox main setup core will consist of at least <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=13172&amp;position=P" target="_blank">Carson Smith</a> and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=9227&amp;position=P" target="_blank">Koji Uehara</a>, with <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=4079&amp;position=P" target="_blank">Junichi Tazawa</a> also likely to see some setup work as well. What will be interesting to see is how exactly those pitchers are deployed Early reports have Uehara scheduled to pitch the eighth inning, while Smith and Tazawa split duties in earlier innings as the situation demands. However, an argument could be made that it might be better for the Red Sox to more evenly divide the setup duties between those three relievers based more on situations and health, in order to keep everyone fresh deep into the season. Of course, this will also depend on how deep into games Red Sox starters can manage to go. The bottom line is that Uehara is coming off of a pretty major injury going into his age-41 season, Tazawa was shut down last season due to fatigue, and Smith is too good to relegate to middle-relief innings.</li>
<li><strong>Who plays most in the Outfield</strong> &#8211; We already know that some combination of <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=17016&amp;position=OF" target="_blank">Rusney Castillo</a>, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=12984&amp;position=OF" target="_blank">Jackie Bradley Jr.</a>, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=13611&amp;position=OF" target="_blank">Mookie Betts</a>, and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=3882&amp;position=OF" target="_blank">Chris Young</a> will be taking almost all of the time in the Outfield, but it is still fairly wide open as to how starts will be distributed among those players. Young will most likely see just about any left-handed starter, so that takes one of the other three out of the lineup. Betts will probably get the most starts, since he is a dynamic leadoff piece and fits perfectly in front of Pedroia and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=12161&amp;position=SS" target="_blank">Xander Bogaerts</a>. It seems like Castillo is the x-factor here, since he is still relatively unknown and has just as much bust potential as boom potential.</li>
<li><strong>Who wins the fifth starter job</strong> &#8211; Unfortunately this is probably <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=9761&amp;position=P" target="_blank">Joe Kelly</a>&#8216;s job to lose. He has a &#8220;live arm&#8221; and &#8220;great stuff,&#8221; and all of those other cliche&#8217;s baseball people like to use, but Kelly has been mediocre at best since coming to Boston. It is true that Kelly can throw hard and look dominant at times, but it is also true that he has absolutely no ability to read hitters or keep them off balance. Kelly is more of a thrower than a pitcher, and there is no reason why he should be guaranteed a rotation job this season. The Red Sox owe it to themselves to at least let one of the the younger pitchers like <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=13143&amp;position=P" target="_blank">Henry Owens</a> or Brian Johnson compete for a rotation spot in camp.</li>
<li><strong>How long of a leash does Joe Kelly get</strong> &#8211; In the likely event that Kelly does win a rotation spot, how long can he struggle before the Red Sox decide enough is enough? We have already covered how the Red Sox bullpen is improved, but it will not be able to stand Kelly lasting three to four innings per start every fifth day like he has in the past. The Red Sox do have alternatives available if Kelly struggles, and if they are serious about winning in 2016, they will not hesitate to go to them if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>How will the catching situation play out</strong> &#8211; This is a topic we will go into a bit more depth on later in the week, but it bears watching. The Red Sox have two of the best young catchers in the game in <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=13176&amp;position=C" target="_blank">Blake Swihart</a> and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=9774&amp;position=C" target="_blank">Christian Vazquez</a>, but Swihart is still young and Vazquez is coming off of a major injury. This makes it likely that Vazquez will start the season in Pawtucket, with Swihart and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=4952&amp;position=C" target="_blank">Ryan Hanigan</a> sharing time behind the dish. But if Vazquez plays well in Pawtucket, or if the other two struggle while Vazquez proves he is healthy, there could be an uncomfortable catching situation at Fenway Park this summer.</li>
<li><strong>Will the Red Sox add another left-handed reliever</strong> &#8211; There is no real need to do this yet, since guys like <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=12673&amp;position=P" target="_blank">Roenis Elias</a>, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=7501&amp;position=P" target="_blank">Tommy Layne</a>, and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=6819&amp;position=P" target="_blank">Robbie Ross</a> will all be in camp. Those are not household names by any stretch, but the Red Sox already have their most important relief innings taken care of, so they should need to worry less about a dominating lefty as long as the guys they do have can do a respectable job in the earlier innings.</li>
<li><strong>Does <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8001&amp;position=SS" target="_blank">Hanley Ramirez</a> even know what a First Baseman&#8217;s mitt looks like</strong> &#8211; Hanley could make or break the Red Sox&#8217; season at First Base, but for the love of all that is good can he at least get his own glove? Hanley has two only two simple responsibilities for the Red Sox in 2016: rake at the plate, and catch the ball when people throw it at him. Even he should be able to figure those out.</li>
<li><strong>How painful will <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=745&amp;position=DH" target="_blank">David Ortiz</a>&#8216;s &#8220;farewell tour&#8221; be</strong> &#8211; Extremely. It was bad enough having to hear about the Derek Jeter nonsense and it seems like these farewell tours have become some kind of PR monster. Can&#8217;t wait until the Oakland A&#8217;s give Ortiz a chair to sit in while his teammates play defense, or the Tampa Bay Rays give him some kind of orange-based thing to stay healthy while he bashes their pitchers all over the ballpark.</li>

The good part about that plan is that Ramirez can’t possibly be worse at first than he was in Left Field in 2015, so there is nowhere to go but up. One aspect of this move that seems to have gone unnoticed is the status of incumbent First baseman <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=11982&amp;position=1B">Travis Shaw</a>.</p>
<p>Shaw played well in his limited sample of plate appearances in 2015, but it appears that there is not much room for him to take an expanded role on the 2016 Red Sox. This may actually be a positive for now, as Shaw’s success last season surprised just about everyone, given his lack of flashy tools and mediocre minor league numbers (.249/.318/.356 in Triple-A in 2015). In fact, Shaw finished the season hitting fifth in the Red Sox order and was relied upon as one of their better run producers in the month of September, yet is still going into the 2016 season without a major role. Is this because the Red Sox basically had nowhere else to put Ramirez defensively, or because they do not believe Shaw can sustain his breakout going forward? Let’s answer the latter question by doing a quick comparison of two players in their rookie seasons with the Red Sox:</p>
