<p>I&#8217;ve got good news and bad news for you, U.S. soccer fans. The bad news is that, despite Landon Donovan&#8217;s last-minute heroics in the Algeria game to send us into the knockout stages, despite the heart-stopping draw (that was really an American win) against Slovenia, the 2010 World Cup is not going to be looked back upon as the watershed moment that catapulted soccer firmly into the American mainstream. Jim Rome and his moronic ilk are still going to scoff, and you&#8217;re still going to get funny looks at parties when you wear your Arsenal jersey.<br />

<p>The Associated Playas, the planet&#8217;s largest organization of pimps and playas &#8211; as well as nymphos and maneaters, since the recent Supreme Court decision &#8211; is proud to offer its Playa of the Year award to none other than Tiger Woods, whose masterful swinging of the wood has inspired us all to reach greater heights of playa-hood.</p>
<p>This playa, freak hos and gentlemen, has style. Woods successfully kept his expert playing of the field on the DL for years, maintaining his sterling public image &#8211; and maximizing the size of the field in which he could sow his wild oats.</p>
<p>And sow he did. The width and breadth of fly honeys through which Woods went like a sex-crazed harpoon through the side of a smokin&#8217; hot whale is both impressive and becomes still more impressive every day.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/12/23/tiger-woods-wins-associated-playas-playa-of-the-year-award/">Tiger Woods Wins Associated Playa&#8217;s Playa of the Year Award</a> (65 words)</p>

<p>Sadly, it&#8217;s all going to end with a whimper. The U.S. men&#8217;s team, barring a lot of luck, might not even make it past the group stages next summer in South Africa.<br />

The defense that had lost multiple leaders and was looking eminently mortal. But, Tommie and the gang were back in business against a tough Baltimore Ravens defense, and even if they never looked like they were going to run away with the game, they also never looked like they were going to lose.</p>
<p>Though the Pats ended the first quarter trailing by four after Joe Flacco hit the ageless Derrick Mason for 20 yards and a touchdown, they were already grinding inexorably back down the field as the second quarter began. The early going wasn&#8217;t easy for the Patriots&#8217; offense, and they increasingly featured their platoon of Kevin Faulk, Sammy Morris, and the impressive Fred Taylor in a drive that ended with a rushing touchdown for none other than Tom &#8220;Goldenballs&#8221; Brady himself. Sammy Morris would scamper in from 12 yards out towards the end of the half to make the score 17-7 at the break, with the defense coming up with a couple of critical stops.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/10/04/patriots-outlast-ravens-27-21/">Patriots Outlast Ravens, 27-21</a> (282 words)</p>

<p>Though the Yankees rode a devastating outing from C.C. Sabathia to <strong>beat the Red Sox 3-0 </strong>to clinch the final regular season series between the arch-rivals, there was an abundance of silver lining in this dark cloud. Dice-K pitched well for the third start in a row since his return from a lengthy stint on the DL, and was mightily unlucky to come up against Sabathia dealing such all-conquering stuff from the outset. The Sox managed just one hit against the Yankee lefty who won his 19th game of the year.</p>
<p>And who doesn&#8217;t like seeing A-Rod do stupid stuff? The Yankee third baseman was called out for interfering with Victor Martinez&#8217;s throw when he turned to argue a call with the home plate umpire, apparently oblivious to Mark Teixeira all alone between first and second.

He looked, in fact, a lot like the Dice-K of old, frequently nibbling when ahead in the count, but gave up a grand total of three hits and three walks and zero runs. Matsuzaka showed signs of regaining his form of 2007: cool, dispassionate, and effective.  He didn&#8217;t give up a hit until the fifth inning. It was, in short, a better comeback that most Red Sox fans could have hoped for. With an Oakland win over Texas tonight, Boston will stretch their wild-card lead to 5.5 games, making the question of where Dice-K might fit into a playoff roster an exciting one.</p>
<p>Angels starter John Lackey rode a 23-inning scoreless streak (!) into the bottom of the sixth, but paid the price for his attempt at a too-ambitious force at third base. Lackey&#8217;s hurried throw skipped into left field, and Alex Gonzalez broke the deadlock on the LA righty&#8217;s error. Boston&#8217;s bats would continue to threaten, scoring another in the sixth on a bases-loaded line drive that Ortiz landed <em>just</em> in front of Juan Rivera in left.</p>

<p>We write crap because every so often, good guys like you give pissy, inarticulate little quotes like that one, Youk.</p>
<blockquote><p>“One night we get beat and it’s the end of the world and the next night we win big and it’s totally solid. We’re back. It’s up and down. One night we’re getting bashed and the next time they’re cheering.

<p>Uh, Youk, how long have you been in Boston again? Nobody takes the sky-is-falling-crowd seriously, and the few who do are justly ostracized. Don&#8217;t worry your pretty bald head about it. The world of sports journalism is riddled with self-aggrandizing jerks who love to hear themselves say dramatic things.
