(boston.com)" ></a><p>The Celtics just finished their second run to the finals in three seasons, coming up just short of Banner 18, what would have been the second title over that short span. The Celtics recent playoff success of course comes on the heels of the worst period of C’s basketball in their history. The previous 14 seasons produced one division title, a mere three teams above .500, six playoff appearances, three total playoff series victories (including one Eastern Conference Championship Series appearance), and twice putting up the second worst record in the sport. The span also saw six coaches at the helm: Chris Ford (1990-1995), M. L. Carr (1995-1997), Rick Pitino (1997-2001), Jim O’Brien (2001-2004), John Carroll (2004), Doc Rivers (2004-present).</p>
<p>Now that the series is over and the draft and free agency is looming, what is to become of the team as it currently stands? Is Ray Allen back? Is Kevin Garnett an expensive 15 (point) and 8 (rebound) guy or is he the more elite player the Celtics acquired (after a recuperative offseason)? Is Doc staying or going? Will Paul Pierce opt out? How far will the team regress? Are they still an elite team, even as an Eastern power? More importantly, how far does the team drop after next year, when KG’s contract expires? Were the big acquisitions worth a short run of success?(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/06/18/if-the-ping-pong-balls-fell-right%e2%80%a6or-did-they/">If the Ping Pong Balls Fell Right…Or Did They?</a> (1,049 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Eagles may have won the National Championship mere weeks ago, but the news is not all good surrounding the hockey program at the Heights Monday morning. Three BC Hockey players were in a vehicle which struck a MBTA Green Line trolley just east of campus early Monday. In addition to the three hockey players, four others were in the car, which was severly damaged in the incident. The problem? All seven in the car are underage and a vodka bottle was found inside the Jeep.</p>
<p>Freshman goalie Parker Milner (10-2-1, 2.32 GAA, .909 SV%) is the most prominent of the three who is facing charges. The other athletes are Philip Samuelsson (1 G, 13 A) and Patrick Wey (five assists), both freshman defensemen. The other four in the car were driver Jane Stanton, Tina Dilandry, Reilly Corbett, and Elizabeth Motley. Stanton tried to make a U-turn and struck the trolley, resulting in minor damage to the T and no injuries. No word yet on what action Coach Jerry York will take, but it is likely there will be some consequences.</p>

(Getty Images/Jeff Zelevansky)" ></a><p>Al Skinner will not be on the Eagles sideline next season, closing the book on the most successful basketball coach in the program&#8217;s history. Skinner compiled a 247-165 record with the Eagles and now holds a 385-291 record overall in his coaching career, spanning 22 seasons with a stop at Rhode Island prior to BC. He took the Eagles to seven NCAA tournaments and coached a number of NBA players including Troy Bell, Sean Williams, Jared Dudley, and Craig Smith.</p>
<p>Skinner, who was under contract for three more seasons, will get a $3 million buyout and had agreed with the school to leave last week. BC agreed to keep the agreement quiet to facilitate Coach Skinner&#8217;s search for another job, including last week&#8217;s interview with St. John&#8217;s. BC has asked for permission to talk to Richmond coach Chris Mooney and Cornell coach Steve Donahue. Richmond lost their tournament opener to St. Mary&#8217;s and Cornell ran to the Sweet Sixteen before falling to Kentucky.

BC, the top seed, survived third seeded Yale <strong>9-7</strong> to advance to the Frozen Four. Yale used three goalies and 16 players made it onto the scoresheet. John Muse remains undefeated in NCAA tournament games though what were stellar statistics coming into the game took a hit.</p>
<h2>Eagles never trail, but can never bury Yale</h2>
<p>There was a sense that this might be a high scoring affair since Yale is the top scoring team in the nation and the Eagles are third. The feeling was probably confirmed when Carl Sneep of the Eagles dumped the puck out of the BC zone and it bounded past Ryan Rondeau at the other end for a shorthanded goal and a 2-1 Eagle lead. There were also two four-on-four goals, three power play goals, and an extra attacker goal in the game.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/03/29/bc-outduels-yale-to-advance-to-frozen-four/">BC Outduels Yale to Advance to Frozen Four</a> (304 words)</p>

New Hampshire, playing in an evening contest, got off to a slow start, trailing 1-0 with three minutes to go in the second period to Cornell and their goalie, Ben Scrivens. Scrivens had not allowed a goal in three games and only one in their four ECAC playoff games as the Big Red won the league title.</p>
<p>However, UNH came to life at the end of the second with a goal from Hobey finalist Bobby Butler that went through the side of the net. Mike Sislo scored 26 seconds later to change the complexion of the game entirely, giving UNH an edge they would never cede. Cornell went from a team content to nurse a 1-0 lead and let Scrivens carry them to a scurrying team that just could not organize itself, especially on offense. This was best evidenced in Butler&#8217;s second goal, in the third period, which put UNH up 4-1 and really iced the game. Cornell attempted to take the puck out of the zone, but just lost it and Butler emerged with the puck, going the other way, and beat Scrivens one-on-one.</p>
<p>Just to show that it was not Cornell&#8217;s day, Butler was on the ice to go for the hat trick while Cornell pulled the goalie for the extra attacker. Paul Thompson got the puck on the left side with what looked like a sure goal, but dished it over to Butler, on the right side in traffic. Instead, Cornell broke up the pass, but in doing so, directed the puck right into the net, crediting the goal to Thompson. Butler, Thompson, and Sislo each recorded two goals. Brian Foster recorded 24 saves in the win.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2010/03/27/unh-rips-cornell-vermont-penalties-spell-doom/">UNH Rips Cornell; Vermont Penalties Spell Doom</a> (370 words)</p>
