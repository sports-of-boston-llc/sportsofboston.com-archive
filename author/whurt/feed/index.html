<p>This was expected, as the Red Sox recently signed Wade Miley, Rick Porcello and Justin Masterson to provide some depth along with Clay Buchholz, Joe Kelly and Brandon Workman, among others. Cherington has been quoted as saying that the Red Sox will not make any additions to the pitching rotation prior to spring training, but with Cole Hamels possibly up for grabs, who knows what can happen. Will we see another addition to the pitching staff, or are the Red Sox quitting while they are ahead?(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/02/10/red-sox-miss-golden-opportunity-to-sign-james-shields/">Red Sox Miss Golden Opportunity to Sign James Shields</a> (68 words)</p>

<p>Deflate-gate was the topic of choice by many and seemed to draw a lot of attention from the league and other outside entities. I don&#8217;t condone cheating in any way, but the NFL could have used its resources more effectively in a different manner. Now that the season is officially over, it&#8217;s time for the NFL to crack down on off-field activities that poorly represent the NFL. It&#8217;s only been 4 days since the Patriots won the Super Bowl, but already things are going wild and it&#8217;s time for the NFL to step in and put a stop to this.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2015/02/05/its-time-for-the-nfl-to-crack-down-after-flurry-of-arrests/">It&#8217;s Time for the NFL to Crack Down After Flurry of Arrests</a> (497 words)</p>

First and foremost, the Red Sox missed out on a huge addition to their pitching rotation when Jon Lester signed a 6-year, $155 million deal with the Chicago Cubs. Lester would have been a huge presence in the Red Sox clubhouse and would have given them the veteran leadership that they needed in the rotation.</p>

In my opinion, I would have rather seen the Royals win and keep it in the American league. Regardless, it&#8217;s time for the Boston Red Sox to switch gears and turn their focus towards the large amount of free agents that are currently available. Their main focus here should be the improvement of their pitching rotation, and there are no shortage of flamethrowers out there.</p>
<p>Ideally, John Henry and co. would like to bring Jon Lester back to the team after he had a very impressive 2014 season, going 16-11 with a 2.46 ERA in his 32 starts. Lester will most likely command a 5-year deal or longer and the money he asks will most likely depend upon what Max Scherzer and James Shields are seeking. Both of these aces have been tendered offers, and I expect that Shields won&#8217;t be able to negotiate as much given his slightly disappointing performance in the playoffs, and is . I fully expect Lester to be one of, if not the top sought after pitcher in the MLB during the offseason and the Red Sox will have plenty of competition for his services.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2014/11/06/red-sox-2014-free-agent-targets/">Red Sox 2014 Free Agent Targets</a> (193 words)</p>

<p>1. <b>Vincent Jackson-</b> At 31 years old, Jackson would provide a dominant veteran presence to the receiving corps that appears to be lacking. He has however had a fairly disappointing season so far with only 344 yards receiving and 2 Touchdowns. At 6&#8217;5 and 230 lbs Jackson would give the Patriots that much needed boost that they need on offense, if he can repeat the numbers he achieved last season(1,224 yards and 7 Touchdowns in 16 games).(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2014/10/28/patriots-trade-rumors-wrs-vincent-jackson-andre-johnson/">Patriots Trade Rumors: WRs Vincent Jackson, Andre Johnson</a> (165 words)</p>

<p>Now to some this might be a valid thing, but to loyal fans such as myself I believe that things are improving and that they simply had a bad week against a good team. It has taken some time for the offensive line to finally get on the same page and this was seen during their most recent game against the Bengals. Despite all of the criticism, I feel that it was helpful in a way. At the beginning of the game against the Bengals, we saw a more focused and motivated version of Tom Brady, albeit a very angry one at that.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2014/10/08/tom-bradys-days-numbered-with-patriots-well-see/">Tom Brady&#8217;s Days Numbered with Patriots?

We saw the departure of pitching aces Jon Lester, Jake Peavy, John Lackey, Andrew Miller and Felix Doubront, as well as position players Jonny Gomes and Stephen Drew. The Red Sox also suffered a slew of injuries to their roster, including key players like Clay Buchholz, Mike Napoli, Brock Holt and Dustin Pedroia. When the dust finally settled, the locker room of the Red Sox organization had drastically changed. Now the question remains- who should the Red Sox pursue in the offseason?</p>
<p><strong>Ace in the hole- </strong>The biggest concern right now should be acquiring strong pitching that will help on October 1st, 2015. There will be a long list of five potential players that will help the team, and are as follows:</p>
<p>1. <em>Jonny on the spot</em>&#8211; Jon Lester played a major role in the Red Sox pitching staff over the past 9 years, and after being traded to Oakland during the regular season made it very clear that he was open to return to the organization. Lester was 16-11 with a 2.46 ERA during his shared time between Boston and Oakland, and his veteran experience would add a lot to the pitching rotation.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2014/10/07/how-to-fix-the-red-sox-this-offseason/">How to Fix the Red Sox this Offseason</a> (1,194 words)</p>

As a New England Patriot, he never failed to disappoint people with his on field and off field behavior. However, Johnson was relatively quiet until earlier this week when he made comments directed toward Milan Lucic and Zdeno Chara of the Boston Bruins, which may have reignited the feud between the Bruins and the Montreal Canadiens.</p>
<p>Johnson, who is a current member of the Montreal Alouette football team, stated via his twitter account that he planned to join the &#8220;Habs&#8221; so he can fight Chara and Lucic. Montreal is currently without a known fighter, as forward George Parros was released from the team during the offseason. If Ochocinco is in fact serious about his wishes to fight Chara or Lucic, he better have a medical team on stand-by. Lucic is a scrappy fighter who won&#8217;t hesitate to drop the gloves if he has to, and Chara well he&#8217;s Chara.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2014/09/20/chad-ochocinco-johnson-wants-to-fight-chara-lucic-icymi/">Chad (Ochocinco) Johnson Wants to Fight Chara, Lucic (ICYMI)</a> (175 words)</p>

Coming off a tough loss in Week 1 to the Miami Dolphins, the Patriots looked like a completely different team in their Week 2 win over the Minnesota Vikings 30-7.</p>
<h2>Defense wins championships</h2>
<p>The Patriots defense looked solid with 4 interceptions against the former Patriot QB Matt Cassell, one each coming respectively from Darrelle Revis, Devin McCourty, Dominique Easley and Logan Ryan. The Patriots limited Cassell to 202 yards of passing and effectively eliminated Cordarelle Patterson from the equation altogether.</p>
<p>Additionally, Chandler Jones was stellar during his 70-yard FG block and return for a touchdown, which helped the Patriots increase their lead just before halftime.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2014/09/14/patriots-top-vikings-30-7/">Patriots Top Vikings 30-7</a> (175 words)</p>
