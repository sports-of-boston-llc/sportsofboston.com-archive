The Yankees have won two out of the first three games played and the Red Sox look to come away with a series split. The Red Sox only win came on Friday, beating the Yankees 4-2 which gave<a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/28487/jon-lester"> Jon Lester </a>his first win of the season. Although the Red Sox bats have been somewhat quiet during this series the pitching has not been all that bad outside of Lackey&#8217;s tough start yesterday. The Sox look to <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/30066/felix-doubront">Felix Doubront </a>tonight to turn things around and split the four game series.</p>
<p>Doubront&#8217;s last start was a tough one against the <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/team/_/name/tex/texas-rangers">Texas Rangers </a>only going 2 and 2/3 innings allowing 6 hits and 5 earned runs dropping him to 1-1 on the season. <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/30400/ivan-nova">Ivan Nova </a>who is also 1-1 on the season, will be taking the mound for the Yankees. Nova&#8217;s last outing was a tough one as he allowed seven runs on 10 hits in 3 and 2/3 innings against the Baltimore Orioles. Although tonight will not be a traditional pitching duel expect a competitive start from both starters under the national spotlight. The Sunday night baseball atmosphere never really seems to disappoint the fans of ether ball club. With the Red Sox coming off a tough loss yesterday they are looking to get back on track, so it should be a well fought out game between the two teams.</p>
<p>Players to watch tonight for the Red Sox are Felix Doubront to see how he reacts after a rough outing against the Rangers,<a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/3748/david-ortiz"> David Ortiz </a>who is 3-10 in the series look for him for some run support with the short field in right field. Keep an eye Red Sox rookies <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/31606/xander-bogaerts">Xander Bogaerts </a>and <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/32362/jackie-bradley-jr">Jackie Bradley Jr</a>. as well to see how they handle the atmosphere of playing Sunday night baseball in Yankee Stadium. As the captain for the Yankees<a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/3246/derek-jeter"> Derek Jeter </a>is sitting this game out due to a tight quadriceps. Keep an eye out for Ivan Nova to see if he can bounce back from his rough outing against the Orioles, <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/6309/brian-mccann">Brian McCann</a> who has been hot this series to see if he can keep his bat going, and former Red Sox <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/28637/jacoby-ellsbury">Jacoby Ellsbury </a>who also has had a hot series being on the other side of the rivalry.</p>
