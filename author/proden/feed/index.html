<p>Who is the favorite to win Super Bowl 51? New England? Seattle? Who is the smart pick? Dallas or Oakland? Is there a longshot team that could upset the chalk for the Lombardi Trophy? Maybe the New York Giants are the underdog pick? <a href="http://www.betphoenix.ag/news/nfl/super-bowl-51-picks-10108" target="_blank">Read more&#8230;</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Tom Brady is officially free.  After Serving his four game suspension, Brady is set to start Oct<a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2016/10/03/brady-is-back/brady-4/" rel="attachment wp-att-87959"><img class="alignright wp-image-87959" src="https://i1.wp.com/sportsofboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brady.jpg?resize=247%2C164&#038;ssl=1" alt="Brady" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/sportsofboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brady.jpg?resize=451%2C300&amp;ssl=1 451w, https://i1.wp.com/sportsofboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brady.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/sportsofboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brady.jpg?resize=200%2C133&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/sportsofboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brady.jpg?resize=130%2C86&amp;ssl=1 130w, https://i1.wp.com/sportsofboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brady.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 247px) 100vw, 247px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>ober 9<sup>th</sup> against the Cleveland Browns.  The fans are excited, the players are excited, and I’m sure Tom himself is thrilled to be back on that field with his teammates.  During Brady’s absence, the Patriots posted a 3-1 record with back up quarterbacks Jimmy Garrappolo and Jacoby Brissett.  If you told me at the beginning of the season that Garrappolo would get hurt and the Patriots would still be 3-1, I wouldn’t believe you.  People were definitely a little nervous about how they would play without Brady but as a team they exceeded expectations.  Yes, it would have been great if they beat Rex Ryan and the Buffalo Bills yesterday and went 4-0 but unfortunately Garrappolo wasn’t healthy enough to play and Brissett looked a little banged up to.  Honestly the whole team didn’t look ready to play yesterday which is unusual to see from the Patriots.  Don’t get too happy though Rex, Brady and the Patriots will be back looking for Revenge on October 30<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>In my mind I think Garrappolo not starting yesterday is a little bit of a disappointment.  Look I’m not a doctor, nor have I had that injury before but I feel like if you want to become an elite Quarterback in the NFL you have to try and play through that injury.  There were some reports that the Patriots were trying to push him to play the Thursday night game against the Texans, which I thought was unrealistic because that was only four days after suffering that injury.  After rehabbing for two weeks though, I thought he was going to play.  He was practicing throughout the week and throwing the ball pretty well.  Playing through injuries show toughness in a Quarterback and it’s usually the elites one that do it.  For example, Brady has played with that injury, Russell Wilson played through an injury this week, and Big Ben always it’s a little knocked up but most of the time he’s out there playing.  Again, I don’t know how bad the injury was but it would’ve been good to see potentially your future Quarterback showing some toughness.  This was also his last chance to really show the league what he can do.  Now unless Brady gets injured, which would absolutely be devastating, who knows when Jimmy will get his next shot to prove to the league how good he is.</p>
<p>It’s only Monday, but I’m sure me and thousands of Patriots fans already can’t wait for next Sunday.  Bradys back, Ninkovich is back, and hopefully the real Gronk is back.  Good luck Cleveland, your going to need it.</p>

<p>On September 25, 2016 Major league baseball lost one of the greatest pitchers in the game.  Not only was Fernandez already one of the best pitchers in the game, but he had a very bright future.  Fernandez passed away around 3 in the morning on September 25 due to a tragic boating accident.  I woke up to this news on Sunday and I was completely devastated.  Being that he was only 24 years old, it seemed like he had a lot of great baseball left but now all we can think is what could have been.</p>
<p>Before I talk about how great a person he was, let’s talk about Jose Fernandez, the ace of the Miami Marlins.  In his short four year MLB career, Fernandez had a career record of 38-17 with an ERA of 2.58.  He also posted 538 strike outs.  This guy could throw heat and he was very electric.  In my mind he was easily in the top 5 of MLB pitchers right now.  Some of his career accomplishments, were winning the NL Rookie of the year in 2013 and being named to the all-star game in 2013 and 2016.  Not only did Fernandez bring dominant stuff to the mound but he also brought a great personality.  This guy loved baseball and he was always having fun.  He was also the Marlins biggest cheerleader.  He loved his teammates and his teammates loved him.  Sometimes he rubbed opposing players the wrong way but that was just him showing his emotions.  Fernandez was just a fun, loving player that would express how he felt about his performance or his teammates performance.</p>
<p>Jose Fernandez, the individual, was also great too.  Fernandez tried to escape from Cuba to America and failed three times.   On his fourth attempt, a person fell into the sea, and not knowing who it was, Fernandez, jumped into the water and was able to rescue the person and get them back into the boat.  The person he saved turned out to be his mother.  At only 15 years old, Fernandez, was already a hero for doing that.  Fernandez, his sister and his mother successfully made it to America and relocated in Tampa Bay.  Jose loved his family and his biggest fan was his grandmother.  His grandmother would climb to the roof of her house just to be able to listen to Fernandez pitch on the radio.  After six years apart, his grandmother was able to attend opening day in 2014 and watch her grandson pitch.  Fernandez pitched a great game that day and I believe part of the reason was because of his Grandmother being in attendance.</p>
<p>Jose Fernandez leaves his grandmother, mother, sister, and girlfriend behind.  One of the saddest things about Jose passing is that a week ago he announced on Instagram that his girlfriend was pregnant.  That child will never know his/her dad but will know how outstanding his/her father was not only as an MLB pitcher but as a human being.  The Marlins have already announced that they will retire the number 16 Fernandez jersey and I believe that is the right move.  He will never be forgotten by that franchise and will be watching down on that team.  Baseball will miss you Jose, keep smiling and forever Rest in Peace.</p>

This was their 6th straight win and they have now moved into the top spot in the wildcard. They are now only one game behind Toronto for first place in the division. One of the many reasons the Sox are playing so well is star outfielder, Mookie Betts.  Betts is playing unbelievable right now and definitely should be in discussion for MVP right now. Since August, he has batted .403, with seven homeruns and 20 RBI’s. He had a three home-run game against Arizona on the 14th and a two home-run game against the Orioles on the 16th. The three home-run game was Bett’s second time doing that this season and the first time a Red Sox player has done that since the great Ted Williams. I know that Jose Altuve is having an amazing year, batting .364 for the Astros, but if the Sox make the playoffs and the Astro’s don’t than Betts should hands down get the MVP.</p>
<p>The Red Sox starting pitching has also been a big factor why they have won 6th straight games. In the past seven days the Sox starting pitching has only let up a total of eleven runs. Rick Porcello picked up his 16th win on Sunday, and all season long has given the Sox a pitcher they can rely on. If Porcello keeps pitching as well as he has, he will definitely be in the discussion for Cy young. Rodriguez has also been a nice surprise lately. In the month of August he has an ERA of 2.08. It really seems like he is turning around his season. Unfortunately, on Tuesday, while pitching a no hitter through four innings he had to come out of the game due to injury. Hopefully, this is just something minor and continues to pitch well for the rest of the season.</p>
<p>The Sox have 43 games left and a three game lead in the Wild card standings so as of right now they are in a good position to make the playoffs. I believe that they will and if they don’t I will consider this season a disappointment. Go sox!</p>

Last night he had his best game of his Red Sox career, bashing three home runs and making a few outstanding defensive plays. We all know he has the talent to be a great offensive player like he was last night but sometimes it doesn’t show. He has been a great surprise at first place though. At the end of the season he possibly could be a gold glove candidate. If someone told me that at the start of the season, I would have laughed in their face. I’ll take his not consistent offense if he keeps on playing excellent defense.</p>
<p>Drew Pomeranz- Pomeranz had a rough outing in his first start as a Boston Red Sox. He started off pretty well but then completely fell apart in the fourth inning. He gave up 5 runs in the fourth without recording an out and eventually was pulled out by John Farrell. Even though he struggled in his first start, I still believe he can be a good addition for this team. Let’s wait for a few more starts before we start criticizing the trade.</p>
<p>John Farrell- Even with the Sox being 14 games over .500, I still think Farrell hasn’t been a good manager this year. Some of his decisions this season, especially his pitching decisions, really confuse me. On Tuesday he brought in Koji Uehara in to a 4-0 Red Sox lead in the ninth. Uehara is now the closer, due to a couple other injuries, and it seemed unnecessary to bring him in. Unfortunately, Uehara ended up straining his pectoral muscle and getting placed on the 15-day DL. I also think that Farrell should have left Pomeranz in the game last night. I know he was struggling in the fourth inning but he was also a little bit unlucky. The two base hits that he gave up were weak ground balls.</p>

<p>Dave Dombrowski is wheeling and dealing again.  Last night, the Red Sox GM, traded Anderson Espinoza, their top pitching prospect, to the San Diego Padres for All-star lefty Drew Pomeranz.  Dombrowski is clearly in a win-now attitude and is doing whatever he can to make this team better come October.  Many people are upset at Dombrowski because they believe that he gave up too much for Pomeranz.  Although it was only one player, Anderson Espinoza, is what many fans and scouts believe to be their best pitching prospect they’ve had in years.  He is only 18 years old but he was dominant pitching for the both the Dominican Summer League Red Sox and the rookie level Gulf Coast League Red Sox.  He has struggled a little in Low A Greenville and maybe Dombrowski didn’t see as much as other people did and decided this was the right time to pull the trigger.</p>
<p>People are also concerned about Drew Pomeranz.  Pomeranz is a 27 year-old journey man who has been traded multiple times, been sent to the bullpen, and been sent to Triple AAA.   He was the number 5<sup>th</sup> pick in the 2010 draft but before this year he was never able to find his groove.  In the 2016 season, Pomeranz is having a career year.  He is 8-7 with a 2.47 ERA, which ranked 3<sup>rd</sup> in the National League.  He’s never pitched over 100 innings, which is a concern, but this year feels different.</p>
<p>I understand why some Sox fans would be frustrated by this move, but I feel like Dombrowski did the right thing.  The Sox want to win this year and in order to do that they need good starting pitching. If Price, Wright, Porcello, and Pomeranz keep on pitching like they have all year than this team will be good enough to win a World Series.  The Pitching market is weak this year and in order to get something you have to give up something.  The Sox did that without giving up either Moncada or Benintendi.  They also have Pomeranz locked up until 2018 so it’s not like they gave up too much for a rental.  I’m sure Ortiz is feeling good about this deal because this is his last year and the ultimate goal for him is to go out as a four-time World Series Champion.</p>

After being up 3-1 in the Western Conference finals, Kevin Durant and the Oklahoma City Thunder collapsed and lost the series to the Warriors. Now Kevin Durant is simply joining the team that he couldn’t beat. Over the last few days he has been taking a lot of criticism about his decision to join a team that won 73 games last year and has been to the NBA finals back to back years. I think he deserves the criticism he’s getting because I feel like he’s taking the easy path to winning a ring. Where’s the competitiveness, where’s the fight to want to come back next year and beat these players that just beat you. Many people have said; “If you can’t beat them, join em. It definitely feels that way now days where these players are joining each other and forming these super teams. The Warriors now have four players that are in the top 15 players in the NBA as of now. Most teams are lucky to have one player on their roster in the top 15.</p>
<p>Oklahoma City fans are very angry about Durant leaving and they have a right to be. The Thunder are the only professional sports team that they have in OKC. They love the Thunder and they had even more love for Kevin Durant. Thunder fans were stunned by his decision, not only because they thought he was loyal to the Thunder but also because it took less money to play for Golden State. Why not be the star of the city, have a great chance to win, and make more money?</p>
<p>As a Celtics fan, I was getting really excited of the idea that he might come to Boston.  The Celtics just signed Al Horford to a max deal, who is good friends with Durant.  The Celtics would be serious contenders if they added Durant to a team with Horford and Isiah Thomas.  The Celtics even sent the great Tom Brady to the meeting with Durant.  Unfortunately, the Celtics weren&#8217;t able to persuade him to the team.</p>
<p>Many people feel like only two teams can win the championship next year; Golden State or Cleveland.The same teams that played in the finals the previous two seasons. I love basketball but it sucks knowing that your team won’t have a chance against these superstar teams. I feel like more of a balance would make basketball more interesting and a better product. For now it looks like we will be seeing Golden State vs. Cleveland come next June.</p>

The Boston Bruins have extended Defenseman, Kevan Millar, to a 4 year extension worth 10 million dollars.  This contract extension really doesn&#8217;t make any sense to me.  This guy is a player that they could of easily let go and saved the money for more of an impact player.  I think 4 years, 10 millions for Miller is a high over payment.  This past year was probably Miller&#8217;s worst year as a Bruin and he was also injured for 11 games.  He scored 5 goals, which isn&#8217;t bad for a player like him, but in his career he&#8217;s only scored 8 total goals.  2.5 million a year for him is too much money for a player that scores as little as that.</p>
<p>Another reason this signing bugs me is that they already have a very similar player in Adam Mcquaid.  They are both your typical defensive defenseman that are third pairing and you really need only one of those on your team.  The Bruins should be worrying about who they are going to pair for the first paring defenseman.  Chara and Seidenberg are getting older and aren&#8217;t the same players they used to be.  The Bruins are in need of some young new Defenseman and they aren&#8217;t going to be able to get them if they keep on paying players like Kevan Miller.  It&#8217;s still early in the off season but if they don&#8217;t add some new players it could be another long and frustrating year for this team.</p>

<p>After winning 5 games ina row, it’s time to take the 2016 Boston Red Sox seriously.  Last night’s game extended the double-digit runs scored to four games.  They have scored a total of 51 runs in four games, which is extremely impressive.  I know it’s very early in the season and I know this offense will eventually cool down but I believe this offense is very talented and one of the best in baseball.  The Sox have six starting players that are batting over .300.  That is just unheard of.  Will they continue hitting the ball this well, probably not, but they are talented in other areas of the game to win games.</p>
<p>After two seasons of last place finishes, this team is fun to watch again.  All the fans want is to be able to watch this team with interest in September and hopefully October.  It is also looking like this team has good team chemistry.  I think team chemistry is very important thing in baseball and it can make and break a team.  The Sox look like they are having fun out there every night and seem like they enjoy playing for each other.</p>
<p>I believe that this team is a World Series Contender.  Now, I&#8217;m not saying they&#8217;re favorites to win it all yet but I believe that this team is talented enough to make a deep playoff run.  The rest of the AL seems to be weak and the Red Sox should take advantage of that.  It&#8217;s all about getting in the tournament and once you&#8217;re in, anything can happen.</p>

<p>After pitching a complete game shut out against the New York Yankees, Stephen Wright isn&#8217;t going anywhere.  The complete game shutout gave Wright a 1.52 ERA in his six starts.  Never mind him being the best pitcher the Red Sox have had this season, he&#8217;s one of the best pitchers in the league so far.  The 1.52 ERA is 4th best in the majors.  Wright has solidified his spot in John Farrell&#8217;s rotation.</p>
<p>This might just be the beginning of Stephen Wright&#8217;s dominance too.  If you don&#8217;t know, Stephen Wright is a 31-year-old knuckleballer and knuckleballers tend to hit their prime in their 30&#8217;s.  Past Knuckleballers, like Tim Wakefield and R.A.Dickey, weren&#8217;t great pitchers in their 20&#8217;s but Wakefield went on to have along and solid career with the Sox and Dickey went on to win a Cy Young at the age of 38.  If Wright keeps pitching like this for the Sox he could have a another 10 years of quality pitching for the Boston Red Sox.  I guess we&#8217;ll have to wait and see.</p>
