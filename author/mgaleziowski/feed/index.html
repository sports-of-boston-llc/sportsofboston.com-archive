Tonight, Rick Porcello and his 22 wins will take on Trevor Bauer and the Indians at Progressive field in Cleveland. The Indians, led by former Red Sox manager and fan-favorite Terry Francona, will look to capture their first playoff victory since 2007. Francona, who led the Red Sox to two World Series titles (including the team&#8217;s first in 86 years) was &#8220;let go&#8221; after the Red Sox epic collapse down the stretch of the 2011 season. While the bad blood between Francona and the Red Sox organization seems to have dissipated tremendously since the breakup, I think it&#8217;s safe to say that Francona would love nothing more than to stick it to Red Sox brass, particularly John Henry.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where David Ortiz comes in. The man who has carried this team and this city on his back since that magical run back in 2004 will look to fire up the magic one last time in his final postseason appearance. A World Series title would strengthen David&#8217;s case as one of, if not the greatest playoff performer of all-time. Additionally, it would cement his legacy as one of the three greatest Red Sox players to ever live.</p>
<p>David Ortiz IS October. October rolls around and David Ortiz&#8217;s eye lasers zero in on baseballs and send them to the moon. No pitcher is too clutch. No moment is too big. It&#8217;s time to ride Big Papi to the promise land one final time. God, am I going to miss this guy.</p>
<p>No beisbol is safe, no beisbol is safe.</p>

They took a beating from the surging Tigers, and they were on the verge of being stomped out by the under-performing, last place Angels. All day long, the offense was stagnant to say the least. Steven Wright, who has been a shell of the pitcher we came to love earlier this season, did his best to work his way in and out of trouble throughout the entire afternoon. But his tightrope act eventually succeeded three runs to an Angels offense that should have jumped all over the knuckleballer much earlier in the game. As the innings painfully kept rolling along, the Sox offense did their best to ensure that the Angels would walk away with a 3-1 series victory.</p>
<p>That was until Dustin Pedroia came to the plate with two on and two out in the top of the ninth inning. Pedey took a high, first pitch fastball from Houston Street that was right in his wheelhouse. It appeared as though he&#8217;d missed his pitch, but Street went right back to the well with another high heater, and the former AL MVP jumped all over it and sent it over the center field wall to put the Sox up 4-3. For good measure, Xander Bogaerts followed up Pedroia&#8217;s heroics with a yabo of his own, and the Sox were able to close out a 5-3 victory in a game that they had no business winning in the first place.</p>
<p>These are the kinds of games that playoff caliber teams, and moreover, championship caliber teams find ways to win. There&#8217;s no telling if this Sox team has the resolve to be either of those just yet, but it&#8217;s certainly a step in the right direction. Lord knows the Orioles and Jays aren&#8217;t going anywhere anytime soon.</p>

He did it all without his number one wideout in Kelvin Benjamin, who will be ready to go for the 2016 campaign. Many think that Cam will regress back to the mean this year, as he won&#8217;t be forced to run as often with an improved offensive line and the return of some key contributors in the passing game. That being said, I&#8217;m of the belief that Cam is poised for another monster year in 2016. He made tremendous strides in term of accuracy and pocket presence last season, and at the ripe young age of 27, he still has room to grow in all aspects of his game. If Cam can continue to develop as a passer, use his legs when the opportunity presents itself, and avoid the kind of injuries that have thwarted his fantasy potential over the years, he should be an absolute stud once again in 2016.</p>
<p>2.) <strong>Aaron Rodgers</strong>&#8211; The longtime &#8220;King of Fantasy QB&#8217;s&#8221; was finally dethroned this past season, but that doesn&#8217;t mean he isn&#8217;t poised for another big year in 2016. Last year, Rodgers finished a disappointing 7th in QB rankings, (ESPN scoring) so conventional wisdom might suggest that he&#8217;s not the fantasy superstar we&#8217;ve grown accustomed to over the years. Well in the words of my guy Lee Corso &#8220;Not so fast my friends!&#8221;. Rodgers less-than-stellar numbers can be attributed to a number of factors, the least of which have to do with his play or ability. First off, his receiving corps were held together by glue and popsicle sticks, with Jordy Nelson out for the entire year and Randall Cobb battling a bevy of injuries over the course of the season. Secondly, Rodgers once stud RB1 Eddie Lacy took one too many trips to PF Chang&#8217;s last offseason and quickly became one big, fat punchline. Eddie Lacy wasn&#8217;t just football fat, he was &#8220;Jonah Hill pre-21 Jump Street fat&#8221;. Luckily for Rodgers, Nelson appears as though he&#8217;ll be ready to start the year and Lacy has popped in the &#8220;Kanye West get right for the summer workout tape&#8221; and has slimmed down considerably. Given those developments and the fact that Rodgers is still the most gifted thrower in the league, he should once again return to fantasy dominance in 2016.</p>
<p>3.) <strong>Tom Brady + Replacement Level QB-</strong> Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know that Tom is suspended for the first four games of the year for the horrendous acts he committed against humanity. I know that most quarterbacks would be at a tremendous disadvantage having missed the first four games of the season, and I know that it might take Tom and the boys a few weeks to truly get firing on all cylinders.  What I also know is that Tom Brady put together a stellar 2015 campaign that saw him finish 2nd among QB&#8217;s in points (ESPN scoring) and throw for the most touchdowns (36) and the least interceptions (7) among starting quarterbacks. He did all of this while missing his number one wide receiver in Julian Edelman for a majority of the season, as well as emerging pass-catching threat Dion Lewis. Consider these factors along with the common knowledge that Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all-time, and you can begin to see why I am so high on him despite his four game suspension. Brady will also benefit from the return of left tackle Nate Solder as well as offensive line coach Dante Scarnecchia, who should help to remedy the Patriots porous offensive line that allowed Brady to be sacked 38 times in 2015. When Brady does finally take the field, he will be more motivated than ever to prove that Deflategate was one giant hoax from the start, and that he and the Patriots are still the big, bad bullies on the block. Drafting a QB in the later rounds with a favorable schedule weeks 1-4 (something I will get into in my draft strategy column)  along with Brady could result in the highest scoring QB for you and your team in 2016. A pissed off Tom Brady offense will be running up the score every chance they get, and that will be sure to render big time fantasy numbers this coming season.</p>

Coming out of the break, Sox fans (including myself) were hopeful that David Price had figured out the source of his struggles throughout the first half of the year. Unfortunately, it was much of the same for Price and the Sox last night in the Bronx.</p>
<p>Like so many times this season, the big lefty looked sharp in the opening frames. His velocity was excellent, painting the black with a fastball touching 96 mph early and often. That, combined with his ability to mix in his breaking ball saw Price making quick work of the Yankees 19th ranked lineup through the first three innings. But, much like it has SO many times this season, one big inning ultimately did in the Red Sox &#8220;ace&#8221;.</p>
<p>So often this year, Price&#8217;s nemesis has been the long ball. While he didn&#8217;t allow a yabo last night, (a small miracle) he did surrender five hits in the fourth inning that resulted in three Yankee runs. Combine that with an excellent performance from Tanaka and the great Yankee bullpen, and that was all she wrote for the Sox and their six game winning streak.</p>
<p>Watching a pitcher with Price&#8217;s track record and ability struggle so mightily this season has been nothing short of perplexing. Mowing down lineups for years with the Rays, Jays, and Tigers, no one could have envisioned him sitting on an ERA of 4.36 twenty starts into his Red Sox career. Here&#8217;s hoping he can right the ship before the Sox and their playoff hopes disappear in the heat of the summer.</p>

Tommy, Tom, Tom. We had a good fight, didn&#8217;t we? We ruffled some feathers, tangled with authority, and left nearly no stone unturned in an effort to clear the name of the greatest quarterback of all-time. But in the end, there was nothing even the GOAT himself could do to combat the outright hypocrisy and lunacy of one Roger Goodell. The battle to prove Tom&#8217;s innocence was underhanded and unfair from the jump, and I for one think it&#8217;s time to move forward with Garappolo under-center for weeks 1-4.</p>
<p>When this whole Deflategate fiasco began some 543 days ago, it appeared as though Tom Brady would have an opportunity to prove what he has maintained since day one&#8211; that he had no knowledge regarding the deflation of footballs during the 2014 AFC Championship game. Throughout this exhausting legal process, it started to become clear that Tom&#8217;s innocence would have no bearing on whether or not his suspension would be eradicated.</p>
<p>What became the harsh reality for Tom and the rest of Patriot Nation was that Roger Goodell, the tyrant, set himself up with absolute, unbounded power when the CBA was put into place a few years back. Due to this stranglehold, Goodell was able to flip Brady&#8217;s case completely upside down and make it about his right to enforce his discipline regardless of a player&#8217;s innocence, or any other factor for that matter. Essentially, if Roger Goodell doesn&#8217;t like the way you cut your hair, he can suspend you for three games. If Goodell thinks you made fun of his hair piece behind closed doors, that&#8217;s four games.</p>
<p>This coming from a man who refused to acknowledge the facts (video evidence) that Ray Rice knocked his fiancee unconscious in an elevator. A man who has turned a blind eye to domestic violence, performance enhancing drugs, and several other infractions that have had a MUCH larger effect on the reputation and integrity of his game than an ALLEGEDLY deflated football used in a game that the Pats won by 38 points.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve said all along, the Brady suspension is a blessing in disguise for the Pats. Tom will have an extra four games of rest, and he will come back to a bevy of talented receivers DYING to catch passes from one of the best to ever lace them up. The extra rest will be huge for Brady and the Pats come playoff time. In addition, it will give the Pats a chance to showcase Jimmy Garappolo, who is nearing the end of his rookie deal and could be used as a trade chip moving forward with a solid performance in the first four weeks.</p>
<p>So enjoy the extended vacation with your super model wife and millions and millions of dollars, Tom. We&#8217;ll be ready for you to return week five and drop a 50 burger on those poor, poor Cleveland Browns. WE STAND WITH TOM.</p>

Last night (or early this morning) the Red Sox acquired 36 year old righty Brad Ziegler from Arizona for prospects Jose Almonte and Luis Alejandro Basabe. Ziegler will immediately help to stabilize a bullpen that has been teetering on the brink of implosion for months. Koji Uehara, while certainly effective at various times throughout the year, has been something of a &#8220;choose your own adventure&#8221; on the bump this season. You never know if you&#8217;re getting the dominant Koji we remember from 2013 who helped lead the Sox to a World Series title, or if you&#8217;re getting the guy we saw last night, giving up monster yabos to a less-than-stellar Rays lineup and nearly blowing a game that the Sox seemed to have in the bag. Junichi Tazawa, who has been an extremely valuable bullpen piece for the Sox over the past several seasons, has completely fallen off the rails this year. His ERA has ballooned since a solid start to the season, and he simply can no longer be relied upon in high leverage situations. Add in the fact that Carson Smith was lost earlier this year to Tommy John, and you begin to see why this move was imminent.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Ziegler will help to spell Sox closer Craig Kimbrel, who has been dealing with some knee soreness in recent weeks. While Kimbrel certainly hasn&#8217;t been the dominant closer we all expected coming over from Atlanta in the offseason, he&#8217;s still the best relief pitcher on this staff by a wide margin. Dave Dombrowski didn&#8217;t bring Brad Ziegler in to take Craig Kimbrel&#8217;s job. The move is more of an &#8220;insurance policy&#8221; of sorts. Ziegler does an excellent job of pitching to contact, and he is a veteran reliever who is comfortable pitching in almost any situation. One of the biggest knocks on Kimbrel this year has been his inability to perform in non-save situations. Ziegler should help to remedy that issue, in addition to taking over the eighth inning role for Koji.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">What really gets me excited about the Sox recent acquisitions is the idea that Red Sox front office is gearing up for bigger, better moves as the trade deadline draws closer. Getting a guy like Aaron Hill, who has been a terrific hitter at Fenway throughout his career (.308) to play third against lefties and give Pedroia the occasional day off at second was the first of what feels like many moves on the horizon for Dave Dombrowski and the Sox. Then Ziegler today, instantly fills another void.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">In order to make the &#8220;big splashes&#8221; on the trade market, a savvy GM  first must take care of the leaks and crevices. Getting a big name pitcher the likes of Jose Fernandez of Chris Sale is of no value to the Sox if their bullpen is just going to give up the lead in the 7th or 8th. It&#8217;s now clear that the Sox are in it for the long haul, and that Dave Dombrowski has a few more tricks up his sleeve before the August 1st deadline.</p>

It&#8217;s all happening! Everything is awesome! It&#8217;s not a stretch to say that yesterday was the biggest day in the Groesbeck/Ainge/Stevens era in Boston. Danny was finally able to close that elusive big-name free agent, and Wyc was able to make good on his promise of &#8220;fireworks&#8221; that the fan base has been waiting on for what feels like centuries. Sure, $113 million over four years seems like a pretty penny, but with the money being thrown around this offseason and the huge cap increase on the horizon next season, Horford&#8217;s deal is actually somewhat of a bargain.</p>
<p>Horford&#8217;s game will fit seamlessly within the Brad Stevens system. He provides a much needed presence at the rim, and gives the C&#8217;s the go-to fourth quarter scoring option that they were sorely missing in last year&#8217;s playoffs. I cannot WAIT to see Isaiah and Horford running the pick and pop down the throats of the entire Eastern Conference come October.</p>
<p>By no means is Al Horford a perfect player, as evidence by his lackluster performance in the playoffs last season against these Celtics. He struggles defensively at times, particularly on the perimeter defending the pick and roll. The C&#8217;s team approach to defense should help to conceal some of Horford&#8217;s defensive deficiencies over the course of the season.</p>
<p>Hot damn, the Celtics are officially back. They finally landed a big name free-agent for the first time in the history of the franchise, (Go ahead look it up, I&#8217;ll wait) and they got a guy who WANTS to play in Boston. KD or not, this signing was a huge step in the right direction for this franchise. If TB12, Big Papi, and Julian Edleman have anything to do with it, Kevin Durant will be donning Celtic green next season in the city of champions. What a time to be a Celtics fan. What a time to be alive.</p>

<p>After the Cavs were blown off the floor in game four, I along with the rest of the country had pronounced them dead. I had begun to write LeBron&#8217;s eulogy, complete with a bevy of excuses and narcissistic one-liners that he would have loved. I popped &#8220;The Godfather&#8221; in the DVD player and was prepared to watch it six times in succession as a tribute to LBJ&#8217;s willpower and mental fortitude. I even sent flowers to LeBron&#8217;s mom and step-dad, Delonte West.</p>
<p>The series was all but over. You could see it in the body language of every Cavs player. They were ready to throw in the towel and fire up the old LeBron excuse train. But then, the King finally lived up to his name. Kyrie got the party started with a tremendous individual performance in game five, and LeBron finally woke up and remembered that he is the single most unguardable player in the history of basketball.</p>
<p>No one, not even Air Jordan himself, has ever had a performance quite like King James had in these finals. I mean the guy led both teams in points, assists, rebounds, steals, and blocks for the series for christ&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>He carried the Cavs and the city of Cleveland to their first title in 52 years, and he did it against a team that was destined to be one of, if not thee greatest team of all-time. Of course, the epic comeback would not have been possible without one of the biggest collapses in the history of modern athletics. The Warriors were completely out of sync down the stretch last night, hoisting up horrible shots and hoping that Steph or Klay (The Trash Bros) would bail them out with a late prayer. Their third best player in Draymond Green outplayed both Steph and Klay for most of the series, and that can&#8217;t be the case if you want to beat a player of Bron Bron&#8217;s caliber on the big stage.</p>
<p>As much as I hate to say it, if LeBron cracked under pressure like Steph did in this series, the media would be absolutely DESTROYING him right now. That&#8217;s the price you pay when you build yourself up as one of the biggest front runners of all-time. When you lose, the blame falls squarely on your broad, freakishly muscular shoulders. But when you win, and dominate the way that LeBron did in this series, then all of the praise and credit if yours and yours alone.</p>
<p>Whatever narrative you want to write about LeBron and his career is now open for debate. The comparisons between he and Jordan that seemed all but dead just a few short months ago are now back on the table. That&#8217;s how impressive LBJ&#8217;s finals were.</p>
<p>So where does LeBron go from here? He did what he set out to do and won a championship for his city, and he did so as the best player on the floor by  wide, wide margin. Why stay? Cleveland is a dump to begin with and I&#8217;ve got to imagine that it&#8217;s burned to the ground after last night&#8217;s celebrations. Whatever he does, his legacy is now set in stone.</p>
<p>I hate you LeBron James, and I always will. Your pompous, self-absorbed demeanor will never allow me to truly respect your greatness. But finally, I can say without sarcasm, that I truly, truly respect you.</p>
<p>PS- Someone check on J.R. Smith. Like right now.</p>

This list isn&#8217;t necessarily a list compiled of the greatest players, but rather ones who&#8217;s nicknames fit them like a glove. Here we go.</p>
<p>10.) <strong>Kevin Garnett- </strong>&#8220;The Big Ticket&#8221;</p>
<p>Back in 1995 when Kevin Garnett broke into the league, Minnesota wasn&#8217;t exactly the most sought out destination to take in an NBA game. In fact, before KG arrived, the Timberwolves had never won more than 29 games in a season. Garnett quickly helped to change the fortunes of the franchise, thus earning the &#8220;Big Ticket&#8221; nickname in the process. The young, skinny phenom was the biggest ticket in town, and he was the ONLY reason to come out to a Timberwolves game 90&#8217;s.</p>
<p>9.) <strong>Kobe Bryant- </strong>&#8220;The Black Mamba&#8221;</p>
<p>Only Kobe could give himself his own nickname and actually have it stick. The black mamba is the second largest venomous snake in the world and it is also the fastest. In his prime, Kobe exemplified all the qualities of this deadly reptile. He was cerebral, fast, and could strike at any moment.</p>
<p>8.) <strong>Allen Iverson-</strong> &#8220;The Answer&#8221;</p>
<p>When AI first came into the league in &#8217;96, he surprisingly donned only one tattoo. The tattoo was a bulldog with the words &#8220;The Answer&#8221; etched above it. The number one pick was exactly the answer that basketball fans of a different breed were looking for. He didn&#8217;t conform to the cookie-cutter image that most players were forced to portray in the mid-90&#8217;s, and people either loved him or hated him for it. AI wore baggy clothes, spoke his mind, and constantly walked the line between edgy and insane. He truly was &#8220;The Answer&#8221; for the city of Philadelphia, as he helped to turn the team into a contender and eventually led them to an NBA finals appearance in 2001.</p>
<p>7.) <strong>Dominique Wilkins-</strong> &#8220;The Human Highlight Film&#8221;</p>
<p>Dominique will go down as one of greatest dunkers to ever lace them up, so this nickname fits him to a T. Anytime he stepped foot on a court, you knew that Dominique was going to do something special. He had a way of making a dunk look effortless and violent all in one amazing, jaw-dropping package. &#8220;The Human Highlight Film&#8221; provided us with a reel of dunks and athletic plays that we will be watching for years and years to come.</p>
<p>6.) <strong>Paul Pierce- </strong>&#8220;The Truth&#8221;</p>
<p>I may be showing my bias here, but Paul Pierce and &#8220;The Truth&#8221; nickname just does it for me. I grew up watching Pierce carry the Celtics on his back through the late 90&#8217;s and 2000&#8217;s until KG and Ray finally arrived to help take the load off. He actually earned the nickname from none other than Shaquille O&#8217;Neal after torching the Lakers for 42 points on 13-19 shooting. As Shaq famously said &#8220;My name is Shaquille O&#8217;Neal and Paul Pierce is the motherfucking truth. Quote me on that and don&#8217;t take nothing out. I knew he could play, but I didn&#8217;t know he could play like this. Paul Pierce is The Truth&#8221;.</p>
<p>5.) <strong>Pete Maravich-</strong> &#8220;Pistol Pete&#8221;</p>
<p>Pistol Pete was Steph Curry before Steph Curry. His handle was untouchable, his court vision was unparalleled, and he could shoot the lights out from anywhere on the court. If the three point line existed during Pistol Pete&#8217;s era, we would remember him as the greatest shot maker in the history of the game. When he got going in transition, it was as if he had been shot out of a pistol.</p>
<p>4.) <strong>Karl Malone-</strong> &#8220;The Mailman&#8221;</p>
<p>Karl Malone was know as &#8220;The Mailman&#8221; because he always delivered (except for championships) for his team. He was a rebounding machine, and he and John Stockton were virtually unstoppable in the pick and roll. Growing up I knew two things: The real mailman was going to bring me my SI for Kids every month, and the Karl Malone mailman was going for 20 and 10 every time he stepped on the court.</p>
<p>3.) <strong>Julius Erving-</strong> &#8220;Dr. J&#8221;</p>
<p>Julius Erving was one of the smoothest athletes in the history of sports. Everything about his game seemed so effortless. From his ability to glide down the court it what seemed like three giant steps, to his unreal leaping talent that helped him to glide through the air and throw down some of the most legendary dunks in NBA history. He was known as &#8220;The Doctor&#8221; because his dismantling of opponents was like an operation. He&#8217;d put you under, and before you know it, you&#8217;d wake up and it&#8217;s all over.</p>
<p>2.) <strong>Earvin Johnson-</strong> &#8220;Magic Johnson&#8221;</p>
<p>Earvin Johnson was simply&#8230;magic. Never before had we seen a &#8216;6&#8243;8 point guard who could do literally everything on a basketball court. His height, vision, passing prowess, and basketball IQ helped make him one of the greatest players in NBA history. Much like an audience at a magic show, fans oohed and awed at Magic&#8217;s unreal talents as he led the Showtime Lakers to five championships.</p>
<p>1.) <strong>Glen Davis-</strong> &#8220;Big Baby&#8221;</p>
<p>The reason why Big Baby comes in at number one on this list is because his nickname has become his actual identity. He looks like a big baby, he whines and cries like a big baby, and his play at times is reminiscent of an infant who doesn&#8217;t quite have fully developed motor skills. I remember watching KG berate Big Baby on the bench and bringing him to tears when they both played for the C&#8217;s. Big Baby couldn&#8217;t hold back his tears, and in that moment, he was no longer Glen Davis. He was now Big Baby.</p>

In a match-up with one of the very best in the game in Madison Bumgarner, Price was as sharp as he&#8217;s been all season long, spotting his fastball and making quick work of an opportunistic Giant&#8217;s lineup. The only problem? The Red Sox offense, who has carried Price through his lackluster start of the season with tremendous run support, forgot to show up.</p>
<p>John Farrel has to take the lion&#8217;s share of the blame, as he made what I believed to be a huge blunder in the final inning. With men on first and second and just one out, the struggling Travis Shaw was due up to bat. Shaw has looked absolutely lost at the plate as of late, and Farrel should have pinch hit Rutledge or Hernandez for Shaw in this spot. Instead, Farrell elected to take the bat out of the hands of the hottest hitter on the team in Chris Young, and Shaw struck out on a breaking ball in the dirt.</p>
<p>Let me be clear- I am not among the contingency who believe that the Sox are winning despite John Farrell. I think he&#8217;s done a fine job this season, and he&#8217;s earned the right to be at the helm through the playoff push. But some of his in-game decisions this year have been baffling to say the least, and it&#8217;s going to catch up with him at some point or another.</p>
<p>While the loss was certainly frustrating, my big takeaway was the performance of the man brought in to be the ace of this staff.  Price looked like the confident, controlled pitcher we all remember from his days of mowing down lineups in Tampa and Detroit, and he outlasted one of the baseball&#8217;s elite in Bumgarner last night. He got stronger as the game went on, with his fastball touching 95 as late as the 7th and 8th ininngs. Once again, Price was once again done-in by the long ball, which has been the crux of his struggles all season long.</p>
<p>So yeah, the Sox split the mini-series with the Giants, but this series may ultimately be remembered as the moment when David Price found &#8220;it&#8221; for the first time in a Red Sox uniform. Despite their potent lineup, the Sox won&#8217;t be a true contender without a dominant Price come October.</p>
