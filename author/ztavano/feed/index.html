In just this month only, David Ortiz passed Mickey Mantle on the all time home run list, Rick Porcello reached 20 wins (21st win Monday), Hanley Ramirez was named AL Co-Player of the week on Monday, and Boston now sits in a comfortable four game lead in the AL East.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t been watching the Red Sox play this month then you&#8217;ve been missing out on some great games. They have been playing superb baseball as the post season is right around the corner. The Sox just came off a four game series sweep on the New York Yankees. A series in which Hanley Ramirez homered four times. The series was started off with a monster three run walk off home run from Hanley himself. He now has 28 homers and 106 rbis on the season. Not only is Hanley hitting timely home runs but he has been <strong>DESTROYING </strong>these home runs. I was at Fenway a week ago when the Sox had a 12-2 win over the Orioles and he hit one of the farthest home runs I&#8217;ve ever seen hit over the green monster. I&#8217;m not kidding, it never came down it just kept going up. I seriously think that ball got lost in Mars&#8217; orbit.</p>
<p>On a side note, after ace Rick Porcello picked up his 21st win Monday night over Baltimore, it seems like he may have locked himself in on the AL Cy Young Award. He now is 21-4 on the season and the only competition behind him is J.A. Happ of Toronto who holds a record of 19-4. But Porcello holds a better, ERA, WHIP, and strike out count than Happ. Boston has 12 games left to play in the season so Porcello should probably get a couple more chances to add some wins to his already stellar record.</p>
<p>All that being said, the Red Sox are HOT right now and it couldn&#8217;t come at a better time in the season. The Sox don&#8217;t show any sign of slowing down and are hopeful to play strong into the playoffs. October baseball is almost among us and I&#8217;m very optimistic for great things coming to the city of Boston in the near future.</p>

Coming into Thursday only one game ahead of Baltimore, the Red Sox had some pressure on them. What started off as a slow night turned into one to remember. Heading into the bottom of the ninth at Fenway, the Sox were trailing the Yankees five to one.</p>
<p>Note to self: <strong>NEVER LEAVE A SPORTING EVENT EARLY.</strong></p>
<p>The Sox rallied in the ninth as David Ortiz drove a line drive up the middle to put run number two on the board. Next  up, Mookie Betts drives another run in to make it a two run deficit. Then Hanley Ramirez steps to the plate. Dellin Betances throws a handful of breaking balls to Hanley. When the count showed 3-1, Betances reared back and threw a fastball right down the middle. Ramirez connected with the pitch and hit an absolute moonshot three run home run over the center field wall. Hanley knew it was gone right off the bat, as some may say he &#8220;pimped it&#8221; as he walked down the line and held his bat high in the air.</p>
<p>Hanley gracefully trotted around the bases and then was mauled by his teammates at home plate. The home run was Hanley&#8217;s 25th of the year and it also jumped his rbi count to 100. This win was so important with the AL East standings being so close between the Sox, Orioles, and Blue Jays. Boston now sits in first place and two games ahead of Baltimore. Every game in September is an important win as the Sox are nearing the end of the regular season. Boston has three games remaining in their series with the Yankees.</p>
<p>Not only was tonight a night to remember for Hanley, but also for David Ortiz. In the bottom of the eighth inning, Ortiz hit a line drive home run to center field. It was his 34st homer of the season and also the 537th of his career, passing Mickey Mantle on the all time home run list. David now sits at 17th all time. It&#8217;s really going to be something when he leaves the game.</p>

<p>Porcello has probably been the quietest winning pitcher in all of baseball. After Friday night&#8217;s game Rick holds a 20-3 record. Not only is Rick the best pitcher in baseball right now but the Sox are now in first place and two games ahead of Toronto in the AL East.</p>
<p>The Sox have been playing very well lately as they have won seven of their last ten games. It looks like Boston is establishing themselves as a dominant team in this league as their hitting and pitching has really come around as the season is nearing an end. But much of that success is due to the tremendous season Porcello has had so far. He has a great chance to take the AL Cy Young Award this year.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to get my hopes up, but with the post season right around the corner, I cannot wait for what October has in store for Sox Nation.</p>

The powerhouse hitting Red Sox are now in a position where the postseason is not a guarantee. They have been bouncing in and out of first, second, and third place for a majority of the season. The Red Sox, Blue Jays and Orioles have been the most dominant teams in the Al East all season.</p>
<p>Going into Monday Aug. 29th, the Red Sox sit in second place with a 72-58 record, two games behind the Blue Jays. Baltimore sits right behind the Sox, only one game back. So the question we are all wondering is who is going to win the division?</p>
<p>I believe at this point it&#8217;s a complete toss up. We can pull out as many statistics as we want to predict the end of the season results but we have to remember that this is baseball. This game is so unpredictable, especially when there are only 30 games left to be played. Any team could take the division with being just a half game up, it could be that close.</p>
<p>The good news is that the next month of baseball is going to be tough for all teams in the AL East. Starting tonight until the end of the season the Sox have two remaining series against the Rays, Yankees, Orioles, and the Blue Jays. So the standings in the AL East are going to be jumping all around for the next month. If the Sox want a legitimate chance at taking the division, they need to be the best team in the month of September, period.</p>
<p>If the Sox do not win the division, they always have the Wild Card. But with the Wild Card , the top two teams have to play in a one game playoff match up to decide who moves onto the ALDS. Boston needs to avoid this at all costs because a one game deciding match up is a tough game to win. If this were to happen I&#8217;d be scared to see who Farrell decides to start on the bump.</p>
<p>However I am very confident the Sox will finish the season strong. Their hitting is still very dominant. Ortiz is still showing he&#8217;s one of the best with 30 plus homers and 100 plus RBIs. Mookie is still one of the best hitters in the entire MLB right now with 29 homers, 94 RBIs, and a .321 AVG (Did I mention he was a lead off hitter for the majority of the season?). And Pedey quietly is hitting .320 going into Monday. So the bats are there. Again as we&#8217;ve discussed a million times, it all comes down to the Sox pitching. Starting pitching for Boston has looked better lately, the bullpen is still an issue. All we can do at this point is pray that the pitching comes around going into September.</p>
<p>The toughest series the Sox are going to have this next month are the ones against the Blue Jays. Toronto plays as the biggest threat towards Boston. They are a very well rounded team that can hit and have some pitching. The two series the Sox have against them in the next month are definitely the most imports series they will have all year.</p>
<p>This all being said, I&#8217;m super excited for the next month of baseball because its going to be a a fun one to watch.</p>

<p>Most people may not have known that Nate Ebner was a rugby player at heart. He never played high school football and played rugby at the Ohio State University. After years of rugby and the death of his Father, he decided to try out for the football team at Ohio State in hopes of achieving his dream to play in the NFL. He made the team and also was drafted by the Patriots after college at the 197th pick in the draft. Not only has Nate achieved his dream of playing in the NFL, he also is a Super Bowl Champion with the Patriots.</p>
<p>And even though the Men&#8217;s Rugby Team is eliminated from medal contention from their loss on Wednesday, Ebner has made all of us proud. He&#8217;s a go-getter and when he puts his mind to something, you better believe he&#8217;s going to do it. He said he was going to be an Olympian, and look at him now. His late Father would be proud of him.</p>
<p>Switching gears to women&#8217;s gymnastics, I&#8217;m sure everyone is aware of who Aly Raisman is how much of an impact she has on the Olympics. Aly and her &#8220;Final Five&#8221; squad got Gold in the Women&#8217;s Team Final Tuesday afternoon. The US beat second place Russia by 8.209 points, the largest margin of victory in olympic women&#8217;s gymnastics history. Aly Raisman served as a large impact in the team&#8217;s victory as she put on an absolute clinic during the floor exercise. Her final routine left me in awe. The moves she pulls off are truly extraordinary.</p>
<p>Raisman currently has three gold medals to her name. She will try to make that four gold metals when she attempts to go back to back golds in the individual floor competition.</p>
<p>Ebner and Raisman continue to impress all of us in what they do. Thank you for representing this great country and bring home more golds!</p>

Mookie tour up July, posting some pretty impressive stats. He batted .368, hit five home runs, had 15 RBIs, five stolen bases and had a 1.068 OPS.</p>
<p>At just 23 years of age Betts is having himself a remarkable season. He is arguably the best lead-off hitter in the MLB as he is is in first place in multiple lead-off hitter statistic categories including hits, home runs, RBIs, and doubles.</p>
<p>Mookie currently has 140 hits (31 doubles), 22 home runs, 71 RBIs, and an average of .306. He joins teammate Jackie Bradley Jr. as the only Red Sox players this year to receive player of the month rewards; JBJ won AL player of the month back in May.</p>
<p>Betts keeps proving to everybody that he is becoming an elite out fielder/hitter in this league and I believe he can easily be compared to a Mike Trout caliber player. Hey if you don&#8217;t agree with me, the stats speak for themselves.</p>

The Sox acquired left handed reliever Fernando Abad from the Minnesota Twins in exchange for minor league lefty Pat Light.</p>
<p>Abad will help the Sox&#8217;s struggling bullpen as left handed hitters have only a .163 batting average off him this season. This is not a big trade but will definitely aid the Sox a little with their pitching situation. But the move that everyone was hoping for was to see another stud pitcher in the starting rotation.</p>
<p>Everyone knows Chris Sale was the talk of the deadline but it was no surprise to me that he stayed with Chicago. A dominant pitcher like him is not going to go anywhere without a very large trade being put in place. It&#8217;s a shame the Sox couldn&#8217;t snag him because he is just what we are missing.</p>
<p>However, I have to say I am very surprised Andrew Benintendi and Joan Moncada stayed with the AA Portland Sea Dogs. I expected the Sox to move at least one of them in a trade to acquire a starting pitcher. Now that they are staying in the Sox farm system, I don&#8217;t know what the Sox are going to do with their starting rotation.</p>
<p>The addition of Drew Pomeranz was viewed as a good move at first but is looking a little shaky right now. Steven Wright has had a couple bad starts lately and David Price is still yet to get into a consistent groove. The only consistent pitcher the Sox have right now is Rick Porcello who quietly has been a stud this year with a 14-2 record.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what the Sox are going to do but if they want to be serious contenders for the playoffs, their pitching has to make some adjustments. The AL East and the American League in general is very competitive right now and it&#8217;s really a toss up for which teams are going to win the division and the wild card.</p>
<p>Safe to say this trade deadline helped, but it wasn&#8217;t enough.</p>

Two Red Sox players are considered to be serious contenders in this year&#8217;s insanely competitive AL MVP race. Those two players are Xander Bogaerts and David Ortiz. However there are many other great players to consider when talking about the MVP race.</p>
<h2>Potential AL MVP Candidates</h2>
<ul>
<li>Josh Donaldson</li>
<li>Jose Altuve</li>
<li>Robinson Cano</li>
<li>Mike Trout</li>
<li>Manny Machado</li>
</ul>
<p>Many people put Josh Donaldson at the top of the list right now. Donaldson was the AL MVP last season and is once again having himself a fantastic season. But I personally wouldn&#8217;t put him at the top of the list right now. If I had to choose a player right now to be at the top of the AL MVP race I would choose Astros 2B Jose Altuve. Altuve currently leads to MLB with 135 hits and a .358 AVG. Right behind Altuve I would put Ortiz. Ortiz leads the MLB with 34 doubles, a SLG of .665, and an OPS of 1.083.</p>
<p>The only problem with Ortiz is that he&#8217;s a DH. Many people use that against him because there are no defensive stats to credit him with. But with the performance David is having at the plate this year makes him a serious contender for the MVP award in his final season.</p>
<p>Do not forget about Xander Bogaerts. He is being viewed as a genuine player to win the award. He is arguably one of the best hitting shortstops in the entire MLB. As of Saturday Xander has 125 hits (3rd in the MLB behind Jose Altuve and Mookie Betts), 23 doubles, 11 home runs, 61 RBIs, .324 AVG, .381 OBP, .469 SLG, and a .850 OPS. Xander is also a very good defensive player with a .973 fielding percentage and only 9 errors in 813 innings.</p>
<p>The AL MVP race is going to be a very competitive one this year because there are so may players that could take the crown. But it is only half way through the season so nobody knows who&#8217;s going to stay on track or drop off the candidate list. All I&#8217;m saying is to not count the Sox sluggers out of the race, especially Ortiz. Even though he&#8217;s a DH, he&#8217;s putting up one of the best seasons of his career and has some of the best numbers in the game right now.</p>
<p>Can you imagine a 40 year old in his last season winning an MVP award? We can only hope&#8230;</p>

So as of right now, Brady&#8217;s four game suspension has been reinstated for the beginning of next season. But all of us know that Brady still isn&#8217;t going down without a fight&#8230;again.</p>
<p>Tom Brady and the Patriots have two options. He can appeal his case to the United States Supreme Court, where a higher court would reexamine the lower court&#8217;s decision on the case. Or he can accept the suspension and move on&#8230;yeah that&#8217;s not going to happen. The problem is, there is a very low chance that the US Supreme Court takes his case. But hey, we&#8217;ve seen Brady work miracles in the past so who knows what&#8217;s going to happen.</p>
<p>Brady&#8217;s legal team can also apply for a stay. This means that if the stay is accepted, Brady would be allowed to play the four games while the Supreme Court makes their decision or declines to accept his case. The issue with this is if Brady is granted a stay and ends up losing the case, he would have to serve his four game suspension most likely in the middle to end of the regular season, which would be worse. So Brady and his legal team have many factors to consider when making their decision.</p>
<p>Many people believe Brady is hurting his team or being selfish for what he is doing but he is doing what he believes is right. He believes that he is innocent and he will never admit to something he hasn&#8217;t done. I mean he may take this to the Supreme Court, this is some serious stuff. If Brady was guilty, do you really think he would go through all this trouble and stress just so he isn&#8217;t suspended four games? I mean come on, this whole thing is still unbelievable to me.</p>
<p>However it&#8217;s not over yet, once again there is still hope for Tom Brady and Patriots Nation. All we can hope for is justice to be served and for Brady to finally receive his innocence. This final step in the legal system really is going to be a Hail Mary for the Patriots.</p>
<p>Free Brady</p>

Tom Brady, the GOAT, was in attendance at the meeting to help Danny Ainge in the recruitment of Durant. Also David Ortiz would have been there to help but he was busy nuking baseballs into the stands at Fenway.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Kevin Durant needs to come to Boston. The Celts just signed All-Star Al Horford to a four year 113 million dollar deal, Isaiah Thomas is our point guard, Brad Stevens is the head coach, and the team is only improving. If Durant signs with Boston, they immediately become a contender for the NBA Finals. This new big three of Thomas, Horford, and Durant would be absurd. Three legitimate elite players on the same team would do some damage next season so it only makes sense for Kevin to play for the Celtics and he has to know that.</p>
<p>One thing I hope Kevin understands is just how praised he will be in Boston. Players in the NBA know that Boston fans are different. We&#8217;re the most passionate fans out there and we are always there supporting our team through the good and the ugly. Al Horford told his Dad that part of the reason he signed with the Celtics is because of the fans. He knows that when he steps foot on the hardwood in the Garden wearing that green jersey, everyone is going to go nuts for him. If Kevin Durant does the same, he will become loved beyond belief in Boston and I know that for a fact. And hey it&#8217;s Boston&#8230;who doesn&#8217;t love it here?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what was said in Durant&#8217;s meeting with the Celtics but I do know one thing. Ainge most definitely told Durant that if he comes to Boston, he will become a Celtic legend, just like he told Isaiah. So please Kevin, make the right and best decision of your life and play for the best basketball franchise ever.</p>
