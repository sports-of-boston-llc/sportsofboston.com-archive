<p>After giving up 49 points last week The Rams defense was on the ropes, and as a whole I&#8217;m sure they were a team that was looking to get home after back to back games in the pacific time zone.  The Patriots scored on their first possession, a 4th and 1 rush by LeGarrette Blount that went for 43 yards and a touchdown.  Then they scored early in the second on a touchdown pass from Tom Brady to Chris Hogan, however after this the offense hit a wall.</p>
<p>The Patriots average 3.1 offensive touchdowns per game, yesterday they scored 2 and struggled to do so.  Without Gronk the offense doesn&#8217;t thrive like they should.  Not having that big body in the middle of the field hurts them, Gronk is a matchup nightmare, he does things on the football field that most guys can only dream of doing.  The Patriots always preach about finishing drives off with touchdowns, well yesterday they kicked 4 field goals.  When the playoffs come around you have to score touchdowns, not kick field goals.  On the season The Patriots have been stellar on 3rd downs.  They are 6th in the league with a conversion rate of 44.5%.  Yesterday they were 4-12 on third down.  When Brady needs a completion he looks for his hall of fame tight end, and when he&#8217;s not there things change.</p>
<p>The Patriots are still the favorites in the AFC, but without Gronk it levels the playing field.  The defense will have to play more like it did yesterday, and multiple guys are going to have to step up on offense to pick up the slack of Gronk not being there.</p>

Andrew Miller was a huge factor coming out of the bullpen this series, most of the time leaving The Sox batters swinging at air.  Ben Cherington is the vice president of baseball operations in Toronto.  So basically, Francona and Miller are playing against Cherington, winner plays Theo Epstein and Jon Lester in the World Series.  Jeesh, imagine having all these guys in the same organization.  Oh wait they were, and the ownership screwed it up.</p>
<p>Dave Dombrowski doesn&#8217;t get a pass on this season either.  Aaron Hill, Fernando Abad, Brad Ziegler, and Drew Pomeranz were Dombrowski&#8217;s moves at the deadline.  These guys were a non factor, except for Pomeranz who gave up a 2 run BOMB to Coco Crisp, essentially losing the game.  How about David Price&#8217;s deal?  He got a 7 year, $217 million dollar deal from Dombroski, a deal that will ultimately end up being a failure, if it&#8217;s not already.  For a guy that was supposed to come in and turn things around, Dombrowski has been a letdown as president of baseball operations thus far.</p>
<p>Winning the series at Fenway last night meant a lot to Terry Francona, you could tell by the way he was reacting on the field.  He knows when he was fired that ownership was stirring up rumors about him, and last night he left with the last laugh.  I&#8217;m sure Jon Lester was laughing somewhere too, remember that horrible offer The Sox gave him?  4 years for $70 million?  Then they turn around and give Price 7 years for $217 million, what a joke.  You know what you had in Lester, he could handle the Boston spotlight and he could win in the playoffs.  Two things that David Price can not do.</p>
<p>This team needs a shake up and ownership has to provide it, and as of now it seems like it&#8217;s not going to happen.  Dombrowski just announced Farrell will be back next season.</p>
<p>Ortiz retired and Farrell coming back.  Just doesn&#8217;t seem right.</p>

<p>As of now we&#8217;ve all seen the Brady hype videos, and starting tomorrow we finally get to live it.  Let&#8217;s face it, it&#8217;s been a long 4 weeks.  Jimmy G and Jacoby Brissett did their jobs, even tho Garoppolo should have played last week but that&#8217;s a discussion for another time.  However as of tomorrow we don&#8217;t have to worry about those two anymore (hopefully).  Tomorrow we finally get our hall of fame quarterback, back on the field where he belongs.</p>
<p>The Players or Brady himself won&#8217;t say what tomorrow will be like, but lets face it they&#8217;re going to try to give the middle finger to the rest of the league.  Do I think Brady could be rusty?  Well yes, any player who hasn&#8217;t seen game action in nearly 5 weeks will be rusty.  What I do know is Brady is pissed off, he won&#8217;t tell you how he feels but his father will.  Brady&#8217;s father has multiple times called Goodell a &#8220;liar&#8221;, and has called the NFL &#8220;a kangaroo court&#8221;.  If Brady&#8217;s dad is this upset imagine how his son feels?  Brady was booed at the Super Bowl 50 ceremony, had his name dragged through the dirt for nearly the past 2 years, has heard all the talk about Garoppolo will be Brady&#8217;s successor, and all the talk that Brady is just a &#8220;system quarterback&#8221;.</p>
<p>Remind you this is a guy who has a clock in his house.  This clock is not set to his wife&#8217;s birthday, his kids birthdays, his anniversary, or any other significant moment in his or his loved ones lives.  This clock in his house is set to February 5th, 2017, 6:30 pm.  This is the date and time of Superbowl 51.  Where he expects to be.  For a guy that has played his whole career with a chip on his shoulder, now he has a boulder on it.  Expect the revenge tour to start tomorrow and there&#8217;s no telling when it will end.  Sleep good tonight New England fans, tomorrow football Jesus is back.</p>
<p>Pats -42, Cleveland-10.</p>

<p><strong>Top Picks</strong></p>
<p>Eli Manning</p>
<p>Manning is playing the woeful Saints this weekend.  The Saints have the worst pass defense in the NFL, going into sunday they started 3 defensive backs who have never played a snap in the NFL.  I fully expect Eli and Odell to put up massive points this weekend.  Last season when Eli played this Saints defense he threw for 350 yards and 6 touchdowns.  He will be the most owned quarterback this weekend, but should be well worth it.  Eli and Odell are my number 1 stack of the week.</p>
<p>Allen Robinson</p>
<p>Robinsons price on draftkings dropped from $8300 to $7800, which means he should be higher owned this week.  Robinson had a team high 15 targets last week, expect more of the same this week and for Robinson to break 100 yards and score at least a touchdown.</p>
<p>David Johnson</p>
<p>Johnson is the main running back in Arizona.  When Arizona ran the ball last week it was with Johnson 84% of the time.  Johnson might go under the radar for some people this week as I expect people to fade the Cardinals due to their performance last week.  Don&#8217;t fade Johnson as he will be the key to a successful game by Arizona this week.</p>
<p>Emmanuel Sanders</p>
<p>Sanders is only 6k on draftkings this week, which is ridiculously low for a number 1 wide receiver.  Demaryius Thomas is battling through injury and the terrible Colts defense are traveling to Denver.  Expect Sanders to get most of the targets on sunday.</p>
<p><strong>Sleepers</strong></p>
<p>Steve Smith</p>
<p>Smith had 9 targets for 5 receptions and 19 yards in week 1, I know that&#8217;s terrible.  However Baltimore is traveling to Cleveland who just got burnt by Carson Wentz.  Flacco loves to throw to Smith and I expect the same this weekend.  Smith won&#8217;t be a popular play this week due to his performance last week, but don&#8217;t jump off the bandwagon just yet.</p>
<p>Marcus Mariota</p>
<p>Mariota is a very good tournament play this week.  He didn&#8217;t play well in week 1, he has a great matchup against Detroit, and Demarco Murray and Tajae Sharp looked better than expected last week.  This game should be a shootout and Mariota will be a big part of it.</p>
<p><strong>Risky Stack Of The Week</strong></p>
<p>Jimmy Garoppolo/Julian Edelman</p>
<p>Historically when Miami comes to New England the pats spread them out and throw it all over the yard, yes that is when Tom Brady is on the field.  However I expect the same gameplan from The Pats this week.  Garoppolo should be getting rid of the ball quick and finding one of the best possession receivers in the league in Julian Edelman.  Edelman should see 10 targets minimum this week and will score a touchdown.</p>

<p><strong>Top Picks</strong></p>
<p>WR- Marvin Jones.</p>
<p>I love Marvin Jones this week.  He didn&#8217;t have a very good 2015 season, however he&#8217;s in a new offense with Detroit.  Calvin Johnson is retired, and I expect The Colts to focus on stopping Golden Tate.  With cornerback Vontae Davis out for Indianapolis look for Stafford to look for Jones a lot in week 1.  This game also has the highest over/under of the week at 51.  Priced at 4,600 on draftkings Jones is a great play in week 1.</p>
<p>WR- Amari Cooper.</p>
<p>Amari Cooper is going to have a big week 1.  There are 15 wide receivers who are priced higher than him on draftkings this week, which makes him a great play.  His ownership will be high but he will reach value.  With Drew Brees playing at home expect this game to be high scoring, and for Derek Carr to look for his top target a lot on sunday.  The saints were also the worst ranked defense last season.</p>
<p>RB- Lamar Miller.</p>
<p>Lamar Miller has a very good matchup this weekend against the Chicago Bears.  Miller is a very talented running back who didn&#8217;t get enough touches in Miami.  With Deandre Hopkins putting all the pressure on the Bears defense expect Miller to have a big day catching passes and running the ball.  Miller is my top running back play this week.</p>
<p>RB- LeSean McCoy.</p>
<p>McCoy should be the focal point of the Bills offense this season.  With Karlos Williams not with The Bills anymore expect McCoy to get a lot of touches for the Bills.  His price tag on draftkings is a little high this week, however the potential is there for McCoy.</p>
<p>QB- Brock Osweiler.</p>
<p>Osweiler should get off to a good start in his Texan career with a good matchup against the Chicago Bears.  Expect a lot of passes to newest addition Lamar Miller, and a couple of jump balls to Pro Bowl wide receiver Deandre Hopkins.  Osweiler has 20 quarterbacks higher priced than him on draftkings this week.  His ownership won&#8217;t be what it should making him a great tournament play this week.</p>
<p>TE- Jason Witten.</p>
<p>Jason Witten is not the player he used to be, however with Dak Prescott starting for The Cowboys expect him to look for Witten a lot as a security blanket in week 1.  Jason Witten is only priced at 4,100 on draftkings and at that price tag, and with Witten&#8217;s upside he should be a lock in your lineup.</p>
<p><strong>Sleepers</strong></p>
<p>RB- James White.</p>
<p>With Dion Lewis out, James White assumes the role as the third down running back for New England.  With Jimmy Garoppolo starting against a great Cardinals defense look for Josh Mcdaniels to get the ball out of Garoppolo&#8217;s hands quick, and look for James White to be the beneficiary to the quick passes.</p>
<p>TE- Austin Seferian-Jenkins.</p>
<p>Jameis Winston loves his tight end.  With Tampa Bay playing at Atlanta it should be a high scoring game.  Look for Winston to utilize his big tight end in the red zone which should result in a touchdown reception.</p>
<p>WR- Tyler Boyd.</p>
<p>Boyd should be the number 2 receiver in Cincinnati.  With AJ Green getting all The Jets attention, Boyd could be a good play this week, especially being priced at just 3,600.</p>
<p><strong>Top 2 Stacks.</strong></p>
<p>Matthew Stafford/ Marvin Jones.</p>
<p>As Marvin Jones is one of my top plays of the week, he is also part of my top stack of the week.  The game against The Colts should be a shootout which will pay benefits for both Stafford and Jones this week.</p>
<p>Eli Manning/Odell Beckham JR.</p>
<p>On the road in Dallas, it&#8217;s a division game.  Look for there to be a lot of points in this game and look for Manning and Odell to provide most of them.</p>
<p><strong>Risky pick of the week</strong></p>
<p>Ryan Fitzpatrick/Brandon Marshall.</p>
<p>A lot of people will stay away from these 2 given their bad matchup on paper against The Bengals.  However, if you want to win a tournament this weekend this should be a stack you really look at.  In the redzone Fitzpatrick loves throwing to Marshall.  Marshall lobbying with the Jets to get Fitzpatrick signed this offseason is a good sign for your fantasy team.  Marshall likes playing with Fitzpatrick because he gets opportunities in the red zone.  I expect Fitzpatrick to look for Marshall more than his other targets this week.</p>

<p>After the mostly successful road trip, (I say mostly because of the back to back losses to Tampa Bay), Red Sox nation was optimistic that this team has turned the corner.  They were coming home to face the hottest team in baseball in Kansas City, and The Royals proved why they should still be looked at as a threat in the American League.  Stephen Wright was terrible in his game 1 start, giving up 5 earned runs in the first inning.  Eduardo Rodriguez took a step back with his start yesterday, giving up 5 earned runs in 5 innings.  The best pitcher for The Sox over the weekend was David Price.  Price looked locked in on saturday, which is a good sign going forward.</p>
<p>The Bullpen once again looked over matched and really scared out there.  The Royals put the pressure on teams with their speed and ability to put the ball in play.  Matt Barnes had the worst night of his life on sunday night, he pitched 0.0 innings, and gave up 5 earned runs.  I really would&#8217;ve liked to see Papelbon on the mound.  It&#8217;s been said time and time again, this bullpen has to be much much better if this team is going to make a run in the postseason.</p>
<p>With a nine game west coast road trip on the horizon The Sox have to pile up as many home wins as they can. That continues tonight against Tampa Bay.  A series sweep is a must.</p>

<p>Over this road trip, The Sox starters have a combined ERA of 1.51.  It doesn&#8217;t matter who&#8217;s on the mound right now, from Price, Porcello, Pomeranz, and even Clay Buchholz, they are all producing.  Most impressive all the starters are able lately to go deeper in the game, which really helps with a bullpen as putrid as The Sox pen.  With these being the dog days of summer and another long road trip on the horizon, The starters have to continue to dominate the way they have been.</p>
<p>The offense hasn&#8217;t been too shabby over this stretch.  Betts and Ortiz have been hot of late, and with constant contributing from Sandy Leon, Dustin Pedroia, and Hanley Ramirez this offense isn&#8217;t showing any signs of slowing up.  It would be nice to see Xander get going, his last two games he has had two hit in each game, which is a good sign.  As well as the starters have been pitching they could go south very fast, and if or when that happens it will be up to the offense to carry the load.</p>

<p>Since The Celtics acquired Isaiah Thomas things have been different.  He has brought a buzz around Boston that has been missing since the big three.  Now, basketball fans want to see Isaiah and These Celtics compete on national television.  Which will finally happen.</p>
<p>All NBA fans know Christmas day is the biggest day of the year for the NBA. It&#8217;s the day where superstars, and the best teams compete with the world watching.  It says a lot that The Celtics will be playing. No, this doesn&#8217;t mean the rebuild is over.  The rebuild will continue until the next championship comes to Boston.  However, all the &#8220;experts&#8217; see what&#8217;s brewing in Boston.  We have a young team, a great coach, and now have two all-stars.  Plus, Boston is a sexy pick to challenge the Cavaliers in the eastern conference.</p>
<p>This could and should be a successful season for The Celtics.  The additions of Al Horford, and Gerald Green are great pickups for this team.  Horford is a bona fide all-star, and Gerald Green will be great providing scoring off the bench.  How about Ray Allen?  We all know The Celtics struggle with shooting, so why not give Allen a chance?  I would.</p>
<p>The Celtics had 7 nationally televised games last year.  This season?  They are scheduled for 22.  The Boston Celtics are finally back on the map.</p>

<p>The Red Sox should have won this series pretty easily, but now?  The Yankees are only 3 games back of The Sox in the standings.  The Yankees are not a good team.  They unloaded at the trade deadline by trading, Andrew Miller, Aroldis Chapman, and Carlos Beltran.  New York pretty much waved the white flag at the deadline, and now they have hope.  I&#8217;m not saying The Yankees are a threat in the division or the wild card.  The point is these are the games you have to win when you&#8217;re fighting for a playoff spot.</p>
<p>The Red Sox had a lead going into the 7th inning in all 3 games of the series.  They lost two of those games.  The one game they did win, they walked the bases loaded in the ninth.  This Red Sox bullpen is putrid.  It seems like they can&#8217;t get anyone out, especially when there are guys on base.  It seems like this pitching staff has no guts.  They can&#8217;t get the big strikeout when the pressures on, it seems like they get tight and timid.</p>
<p>This series wasn&#8217;t all the pitching staffs fault.  What happen to the offense?  Just about a month ago they were crushing the baseball.  Now?  They have 2 hits in their last 29 attempts with the bases loaded.  This offense is much to talented to go into slumps like this.  Speaking of slumps, why does it seem the whole team goes in one giant slump at the same time?  It seems like this team is lacking confidence right now.  They could really use a benches clearing brawl to wake them up, or you know they could fire the manager.</p>
<p>They start a 3 game series with Arizona tonight, it&#8217;s safe to say sweeping The Diamondbacks is a must.  Especially with the tough road games on the horizon.</p>

<p>I truly don&#8217;t understand why people are hesitant to give up young prospects like, Moncada, or Benintendi, for a STUD like Sale.  Especially with this being Ortiz last season, I feel like you have to go all in and try to win now.  With Betts, Bradley, and Bogaerts there&#8217;s already a young nucleus in place, and it&#8217;s not like The Sox are an old team.  The way David Price has been pitching this season might also push Dombrowski to make a move for Sale.  Price hasn&#8217;t exactly pitched like an ace this season, so the opportunity to get one at the trade deadline could put The Sox over the top.</p>
<p>When The Sox included Hanley Ramirez in the deal for Mike Lowell, and Josh Beckett people in Boston were not happy.  Hanley went on to be one of the best players in the league for a stretch of time.  How did The Red Sox do after that?  They won a world series, and Hanley was long forgotten.  The point is if you have a chance to win A World Series you do it.  Their will always be another 18 year old prospect, their will never be another David Ortiz, do right by him and go all in for Sale.</p>
