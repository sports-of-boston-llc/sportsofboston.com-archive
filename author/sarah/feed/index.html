The Celtics and Bruins are killing their respective first-round playoff series, the Red Sox are kicking off their season (albeit in a mediocre fashion by Red Sox standards), and the Patriots drafted Tim Tebow. OK, so the Pats didn’t get Tebow, but Belichick-disciple Josh McDaniels did. Instead, the cornerback-heavy Pats picked cornerback Devin McCourty in the first round. Whatever, it’s the offseason. There’s time to iron things out.</p>
<p>On second thought, no, it’s not Patriot offseason. Monday was Patriots’ Day. Here’s a quick Patriots’ Day fun fact: The holiday is only observed in Massachusetts (in honor of the Battles of Lexington and Concord), Maine (which was once a part of Massachusetts), and Wisconsin (because what else do they have to celebrate?). For some, Patriots’ Day may just rub in the fact that the Pats don’t kickoff the 2010 season for another five months. For most, Patriots’ Day is associated with a far richer Boston tradition: the Boston Marathon.</p>
<h2>The Diversity</h2>
<p>Despite all the recent hullabaloo generated by the Celtics, Bruins, and Red Sox, the Boston Marathon was the best sporting event that Boston had to offer this week.

<p>My fifth thought: That’s great for whoever gets a first round matchup with the Bucks (which I hope to be the Celtics).</p>
<p>My sixth thought: Poor Andrew Bogut.</p>
<p>Regarding my first three thoughts, that really had to hurt. An injury (or simultaneous injuries) of that magnitude should be considered cruel and unusual punishment in 49 of 50 states (it appears to be permitted in Wisconsin). This leads into my sixth thought, which in all likelihood should have fallen somewhere between thoughts one and four: Poor Andrew Bogut.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/04/08/bogut-less-bucks-still-a-threat-in-the-playoffs/">Bogut-less Bucks: Still a Threat in the Playoffs?</a> (676 words)</p>

I participate daily. The polls make me feel like I am a part of some greater good. Sports fans need to express themselves, and what better way to do so than a set of multiple choice questions with no room for elaboration or explanation? I genuinely think over my answers before making a selection. Once I have toiled over my choice, I avidly study the nifty little map that pops up to see what the voting tendencies are in other states. I even try to justify other people’s choices. “Those people in Montana probably don’t even know who Joe Mauer is,” or “Of course 80% of Indiana thinks Butler will win.” These polls bring some degree of happiness to my day.</p>
<p>What follows are three polls from the past week which are relevant to the Celtics playoff hopes.</p>
<h2>Poll #1</h2>
<p>While perusing through the polls on Monday morning, one poll stood out to me. The question: Which team is in worse shape for the playoffs? The options: Celtics or Spurs. Now, the timing on this poll was quite opportune (or inopportune), as <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/03/29/ginoblis-28-pace-spurs-past-uninspired-celtics/">the Spurs had just Embarrassed (with a capital E) the Celtics in Boston</a> the night before. Fifty-seven percent of 9,368 voters chose the Celtics.</p>
<p>Pause, blank stare, check to see that I read the poll correctly&#8230;</p>
<p>Yup. Fifty-seven percent think the Spurs are better equipped for the playoffs than the Celtics.</p>

<p>A notable aspect, however, of that time period starting in 1996 was a potential star newly sporting a Celtic uniform.

<p>Ray Allen <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/boston/nba/news/story?id=4862683">wants to retire in Boston</a>. He will take a pay cut and a lesser role on the team in order to do so. Allen has raked in $80 million over the past five years and is playing 36.5 minutes per game this season, so anything less in either category is not going to kill him. (Arguably, playing fewer minutes could make him more effective.) Given that his age is 34 years and rising and his scoring output (15.9 points per game, his fewest since his rookie campaign) is dropping, it isn’t far-fetched to assume that Ray only has a couple more NBA seasons left in him. At this point in his life and career, why wouldn’t he want to stay in Boston?(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/01/28/give-ray-his-way-and-let-him-stay/">Give Ray His Way and Let Him Stay</a> (543 words)</p>

(See: the First Amendment to the Constitution.) In the realm of professional sports, however, talk can be very, very expensive. (See: Doc Rivers’ $25,000 fine for criticizing referees and being ejected from Monday’s loss against the Hawks.)</p>
<p>Once an athlete or coach inks a contract with a professional team, he loses the right to publicly express discontent with anything having to do with his league. Is it wrong for Doc to have stood up for Glen Davis, whose flagrant foul was later rescinded? No. As a coach, Doc is responsible for the well-being of his players. The NBA, however, is responsible for protecting the well-being of the referees whom Doc threatened, thus prompting the fine. So everybody has everybody else’s back, even if the backlash involves a monetary setback.</p>
<p>But what athletes do not lose is their right to privately express their discontent. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the world of trash talk. A recent <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1164796/index.htm?eref=mySI">Sports Illustrated NBA player’s poll</a> found that an overwhelming 62% of 173 players surveyed reported that Kevin Garnett is the NBA’s biggest trash talker. Watching Garnett play, one would never guess that he is such a rabble-rouser. His intensity is menacing, but his play and his actions come across as very controlled and deliberate. I bet his trash talk follows suit.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2010/01/14/lets-talk-some-trash/">Let&#8217;s Talk Some Trash</a> (613 words)</p>

There are television networks, websites, and publications that are solely devoted to athletes. Athletes make themselves famous, they make other people famous, and they live and die with games that are, on the surface, so simple.</p>
<p>Beyond the fame, though, what are athletes to us? They put their bodies, their reputations, and their skills on display night in and night out, but they also have their own lives. There is a fine line between an athlete&#8217;s public life and his private life, and when the private becomes public, we, as fans, have to make a choice. We either root for the guy to sort out his personal life, or we root for the best interests of the guy as an athlete.</p>
<p>When I learned that Ray Allen&#8217;s son, Walker, has recently been in and out of the hospital because of his diabetes, of course I was pulling for Ray and his family. How can you not? But, at the same time, I was left wondering how this will affect the Celtics.

Back in July, when Daniels verbally committed to the Celtics, the <em>Boston Herald</em> deemed him a <a href="//www.bostonherald.com/sports/basketball/celtics/view/20090718marquis_daniels_set_to_join_celtics_pacer_in_to_back_up_paul_pierce/">backup for Paul Pierce</a>. That may be Daniels&#8217; ideal job description, but until further notice, he will be filling the void in the dreaded backup point guard role. I never said that Daniels isn&#8217;t <em>backup</em> point guard material, did I?</p>
<p>The backup point guard position has been essentially uncontested (and arguably unoccupied) in Boston for a few years now. (Recent un-notables: Stephon Marbury, Sam Cassell, Sebastian Telfair, Allan Ray, Gabe Pruitt…OK, this is depressing.) Currently, Eddie House succumbs to deer in headlights syndrome after more than four dribbles, and Lester Hudson, J.R. Giddens, and Bill Walker combine for almost less than zero years of significant NBA experience. Thus, the backup point guard job has been bequeathed to Daniels, who happens to be the Celtic who handles the ball better than anyone not named Rajon.</p>
<h2>Turnovers = Tumult</h2>
<p>Perhaps the least notable of the aforementioned un-notables is Marbury. In 23 regular-season games last season, Marbury averaged 1.6 turnovers in 18 minutes per game. In ten games this season, Daniels (who missed one game for personal reasons) is averaging 0.8 turnovers in 21 minutes per game. Marquis ensures that the ball in such good hands that he could be an Allstate spokesman.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/11/18/calling-for-backup-at-the-point/">Calling for Backup at the Point</a> (476 words)</p>
