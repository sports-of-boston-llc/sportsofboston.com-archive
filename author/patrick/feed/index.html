				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wednesday, <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/basketball/celtics/view.bg?articleid=1182483&amp;srvc=rss">the Boston Herald reported</a> that Leon Powe believes his days in Boston have come to an end. The third-year forward was not offered a qualifying offer from the Celtics and now has become an unrestricted free agent. While I am a little sad to see Leon go, it is not an overly surprising move. With the severe knee injury he suffered, Powe is going to be out for a good length of time, estimates range from December to February on when he will be ready to play again.</p>
<p>The Celtics were not willing to tie up money and a roster space on a player they were uncertain would be healthy and ready to play come the start of the season. Powe was a good young player while in Boston and will be missed. He is a player who always gave it all and did things the right way. He was an important piece to a championship team and will be remembered fondly in the city.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/07/02/leon-powe-not-returning-to-the-celtics/">Leon Powe Not Returning to the Celtics</a> (271 words)</p>

I think now is the perfect time to take a look at the Celtics and what needs to be done to get them back to their rightful place on the NBA throne. Here are five things that I think will put the Celtics back in position to claim next year&#8217;s NBA championship.</p>
<h3>Get Healthy</h3>
<p>Obviously this is the biggest one. While nothing is definite, I think it is safe to say the Celts would have made a real run for the title if Kevin Garnett had been healthy for the playoffs. With that said, for Garnett to sit out the whole playoffs as intense as he is (I thought a couple times during the Bulls series he was going to walk on the court and sucker punch Joakim Noah), his injury was really serious. As sure as I am we would have won the title with Garnett, I am just as sure that we cannot win another championship without a healthy &#8220;Big Ticket.&#8221;(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sportsofboston.com/2009/06/30/celtics-2009-offseason-preview/">Celtics 2009 Offseason Preview</a> (716 words)</p>

<p>The Cavs acquired Shaquille O’Neal from the Suns in exchange for the artist formerly known as Ben Wallace and Sasha Pavolvic. With this trade the Suns are apparently conceding that their Shawn Marion for O’Neal swap two seasons ago was a complete failure and are now trying to right the ship. The Cavs made this trade in hopes of appeasing LeBron James and addressing their greatest weakness, their big men.</p>
