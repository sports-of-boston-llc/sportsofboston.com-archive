<p>Instead of Clay Buchholz returning from his relegation to the bullpen, John Farrell announced on Wednesday that Roenis Elias will greet the Mariners, his former team, for the opener of a three game series tonight at Fenway Park. Farrell attributed his choice of Elias, at least in part, to the potent left-handed sluggers in the Mariners lineup, most notably Robinson Cano and Kyle Seager.</p>
<p>Elias, 27, was acquired last off season in the trade that sent Wade Miley and Jonathan Aro to the Mariners in exchange for Elias and Carson Smith. At the time the deal looked like a steal for the Red Sox, but with Elias in Pawtucket and Smith having undergone Tommy John, Miley sounds pretty good as an inning eater in the back of the rotation. Instead it is time for Elias to step up.</p>
<p>Elias successfully made the harrowing voyage from Cuba to the U.S. in 2010, and in the following year began his career playing in rookie league for the Seattle Mariners before working his way up the minor league ranks to Double-A by the end of 2013. The next year Elias made the big league roster out of spring training as the Mariners fourth starter. That season he pitched to the tune of a 3.85 ERA in twenty nine starts before the Mariners shut him down in mid-September with an elbow strain. In 2015, Elias bounced between Seattle and their Triple-A affiliate, Tacoma, posting a 4.14 ERA in twenty two appearances for the big league team.</p>
<p>In a recent interview Dave Dombrowski noted that out of spring training they wanted Elias to find one consistent release point for his curveball. Instead of employing a breaking ball from three or four different arms spots, the Red Sox asked him to find the best one and throw it on a consistent basis in an attempt to refine his command.</p>
<p>This season on the east coast is a change for scenery for Elias,and he has pitched well for Pawtucket. In ten games, nine starts, he has a 3.54 ERA and 8.85 K/9, and in his last five starts he has been particularly sharp. He has focused on finding a consistent breaking ball this season with the PawSox and will need to use this pitch effectively tonight if he wants to keep the potent Mariners offense off balance.</p>
<p>Roenis Elias is presented with a great chance to prove himself tonight at Fenway and, given the state of the Red Sox rotation right now, can earn himself another start if he pitches well. The Red Sox pitching staff is club&#8217;s biggest weakness right now, and an emergence from this Cuban south paw would help the team immensely as Dombrowski tries to patch together a reliable rotation before the August 1st trade deadline.</p>

The heralded ace David Price has been good this season with a 7-3 record and 91 strikeouts, but his 4.63 ERA leaves plenty of room for improvement. Then there is Steven Wright, who has unexpectedly taken over the second spot in the rotation through his stellar consistency. The knuckle ball profile fits more in the middle to back end of a pitching staff, but Wright&#8217;s impressive performance and lack of a viable alternative have propelled him to the front in the rotation.</p>
<p>Rick Porcello follows Wright in the rotation. The twenty-seven year old had an exciting start to the season but has since seen his ERA creep over four in June, which lends itself to some concerns. The return of Eduardo Rodriguez is a welcome addition and can help boost the rotation if he performs, but doubts about the overall quality and depth of the pitching staff are imminent.</p>
<p>After Price there are some critical questions that need to be addressed, and it begins with Steven Wright. Is he really a top two starter for a potential division winner? There is no doubt he has been outstanding this year, the most consistent pitcher on the team, but the unreliable nature of the knuckleball is a tad concerning. It would behoove the Red Sox to see an emergence from either Porcello or Rodriguez as consistent performance from one of these two traditional pitchers would help stabilize the top of the rotation and ease any excessive expectations of Steven Wright.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with the rotation is the vacancy left by disastrous seasons from both Clay Buchholz and Joe Kelly. Buchholz has the potential to rebound from his demotion to the bullpen if he can find his command, but Kelly on the other hand is a lost cause. Even worse, in his last start with Pawtucket Kelly left the game after four and two thirds innings with an apparent groin injury.</p>
<p>Thanks to the friendly nature of the Red Sox schedule until mid June, John Farrell announced that he will employ a four man rotation until June 18th. At that point he wants someone to grab the role of fifth starter and demand that spot through their performance. This offers an opportunity not only to the incumbents Buchholz and Kelly, but also Henry Owens and Roenis Elias whom have both spent most of the season in Pawtucket.</p>
<p>If these problems with the pitching staff are not addressed from within the organization the front office will have to make a trade. This is potentially problematic because the market for quality pitching at this season&#8217;s trade deadline appears minimal. The two top options are Sonny Gray of the Oakland Athletics and the Atlanta Braves&#8217; Julio Teheran, both of whom will demand a healthy package of top prospects in return.</p>
<p>In an ideal world the team will find a resolution from within the organization, but earlier this week Dave Dombrowski announced he is looking for both starting and relief pitching help before the August 1st deadline. It remains to be seen how the situation will unfold, but pitching is a key element of success for any baseball team and Red Sox could use some help both in rotation and the bullpen as they prepare for a pennant race and playoff run.</p>

He was expected to settle into Boston&#8217;s rotation and this anticipation had cultivated an anxious hope that he could build on an impressive rookie campaign. That anxiety boiled for over three months after the injury. The Red Sox front office exercised caution with Rodriguez through his rehab program, and then kept him in Pawtucket for five starts before recalling him. On Tuesday night at Camden Yards,  Rodriguez was finally ready for his debut with the Red Sox and he handled the occasion in stride. He threw 89 pitches over the course of six full innings, allowing just two earned on six hits and no walks.</p>
<p>The offense opened the game with back-to-back solo home runs by Mookie Betts and Dustin Pedroia, and by the bottom of the second inning the Red Sox had a five run advantage. Rodriguez did not relinquish that lead. He used his fastball early in counts and then worked in a sharp change-up to strike out three batters.</p>
<p>The essential aspect of Rodriguez outing was that it quieted worries about his velocity that had risen when he did not feature 95 mph heater during his starts in Pawtucket. Against the Orioles, he consistently sat around 92 mph with the fastball but touched 94 mph and as he continues to regain both arm and lower body strength the velocity should continue to return.</p>
<p>The addition of Eduardo Rodriguez to the roster adds a sense of insurance to a pitching staff that has some holes with neither Clay Buchholz nor Joe Kelly having proven himself capable of retiring MLB hitters. Buchholz was the man relegated to the bullpen in response to Rodriguez&#8217;s return and after Kelly&#8217;s disastrous outing last night he was optioned to Pawtucket. which leaves a void in the rotation. It remains to be seen how the Red Sox will fill this vacancy but Rodriguez&#8217;s presence should help take some pressure off of the pitching staff as a unit.</p>
<p>His return also presents a precarious situation for the front office. Rodriguez activation from the disabled list feels like the prize of a trade deadline deal. As the deadline approaches this acquisition will have to effect the front office&#8217;s decision making. While it remains to be seen how this process will unfold but there is no doubt that Rodriguez&#8217;s return addresses an important hole in the rotation.</p>
<p>Rodriguez is regarded as one of the more promising young pitchers in baseball and has plenty of time to develop. A role in the middle of the Red Sox rotation this season will serve to curb the lofty expectations of Red Sox fans as the lefty continues to mature, but few question he has the raw talent of a future ace. The camaraderie in the clubhouse should help Rodriguez hone his craft as he learns from the savvy veterans during the playoff push, and fans can expect him to make a solid contribution as the Red Sox strive to stay atop the competitive AL East.</p>

After a senior season in which he was named a 2014 Perfect Game First-Team All-American thanks to a heater that sits aroud 93-96 mph and touches 98, his talent was rewarded with a juicy $1.67 million signing bonus that enticed him out of his commitment to the University of Arizona. As a pitcher he is unpolished but projects as a top of the rotation starter if his development goes according to plan.</p>
<p>Only 19 years old, Kopech is an imposing presence at 6-foot 3-inches tall and 205 pounds. On the mound he works from the left side of the rubber and initiates his deliver from the windup by shifting his body to his left with of his let good and a drop of hands from nose level to his wait. He rocks in to a high leg kick during which his hands move with leg, and then finishes the delivery by falling off the mound in the direction of first base. From this stretch his deliver mimics the same leg kick and hand movement he has from the wind-up.</p>
<p>During his first exposure to professional baseball in 2014 he threw only 13 2/3 innings for the GCL Red Sox, and had a tough 4.77 ERA but did strike out 16 batters. Then last year <span style="line-height: 1.5">he spent the entire season with the Greenville Drive</span><span style="line-height: 1.5">. He</span><span style="line-height: 1.5"> complemented his hard fastball with a developing slider and change-up, and earned himself a 2015 South Atlantic League All-Star selection. O</span><span style="line-height: 1.5">ver 15 starts and a relief appearance he accumulated<span style="line-height: 1.5"> 65 innings pitched</span> and posted a 4-5 record with 70 strikeouts and 2.63 ERA. </span></p>
<p>From a strictly statistical point of view Kopech had an impressive campaign but that analysis overlooks an important consideration. In mid-July his career was thrown a curve ball of its own when he tested positive for Oxilofine, a amphetamine class stimulant in violation of the Minor League Drug Prevention and Treatment Program, and was served a 50-game suspension. Kopech accepted the suspension and apologized for the his controversy but insistently denied that he knowingly used the drug.</p>
<p>Any time a player is linked to performance enhancing drugs there are whispers that emerge which are hard to shake. Until he gives doubters something else to talk about, the allegations will dominate all conversations surrounding him. Given that Kopech is only 19 year sold and claims he had no clue of the substance&#8217;s presence in his system, I expect this story to be forgotten by the end of the year. If he has one good year all the speculation will go away. As a Red Sox fan I sincerely hope it was a honest mistake on his part, and as a baseball fan I expect him to uphold the integrity of the game. Simply put, he must avoid any further controversy surrounding performance enhancing drugs.</p>
<p>Kopech needs to silence the doubters with a big year. It is unclear where he will start the season, but he will likely play a good portion of the year in the Class A-Advanced Carolina League with the Salem Red Sox. If he performs well he may even get a call up to Portland by the fall. This progression is contingent upon the development of his secondary offerings and overall command as a pitcher.</p>
<p>There is no doubt he has the natural talent to become a top of the rotation start in the big leagues. He potential is through the roof. 2016 is an important season for Kopech. He needs to end the critical speculation surrounding last year and move on as a professional by making improvements to his repertoire.</p>

<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Paul Goldschmidt (ARI)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not much needs to be said here. Goldy is arguably the most valuable fantasy player and is only 28 years old. It will be fun to watch him lead a Diamondbacks team with World Series aspirations.</span></p>
<p><b>Anthony Rizzo (CHC), Jose Abreu (CWS)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400">26 </span><span style="font-weight: 400">year old </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Florida </span><span style="font-weight: 400">native is another stud. He is the cornerstone of what may become the Cubs team to break the Curse, and will hit in the middle of their lineup for the foreseeable future. Don’t expect the 17 stolen bases he had in 2015, but he is a high caliber talent worthy of your first round draft selection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jose Abreu gets included in this tier because at 29 he is reaching his prime as a first baseman, and in his only two seasons has hit 30 home runs with 100 RBI. This production may not rise any more, but is an absolute asset to fantasy owners as he reaches his prime as a first-basemen.</span></p>
<p><b>Miguel Cabrera (DET), Edwin Encarnacion (TOR)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s hard to argue that Miggy is not the best hitter in baseball, but what separated him from the likes of Rizzo and Goldschmidt is the injury risk. Cabrera is 33 years old and has had trouble staying healthy in recent years. A luxury when he stays on the field but his ability to do so has become a concern. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Edwin Encarnacion is a similar case. Offers four category production when healthy but struggled with some wrist and hand injuries and is not getting any younger. </span></p>
<p><b>Joey Votto (CIN), Eric Hosmer (KC)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Votto is a model of consistency. He is a pure line drive hitter that reaps the benefits of Great American Ballpark and it seems like he is always on-base thanks to his 21% walk rate. His value is degraded slightly by the lousy Cincinnati lineup this season but he is still a fantasy asset. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hosmer is a player on the rise after his performance last season and is hitting the stride of his career. His steady contact and line drive rates have helped him maintain a good average and there remains some untapped power potential. </span></p>
<p><b>Miguel Sano (MIN), Freddie Freeman (ATL), David Ortiz (BOS)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sano is oozing upside despite the fact that he has yet to manage MLB pitching enough to maintain a decent average, He has keeper value rooted in the elite raw power and young age, but he needs to find a position to play on the diamond so that he does not have assume a strictly DH role. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Freddie Freeman will have the unfortunate duty of hitting in the middle of the Braves lineup this year. Pitchers are likely to pitch around him and there no one behind him likely to produce on a consistent basis. He is  really good line drive hitter entering his prime but the problem is his supporting cast. A keeper, but he will not be able to do it all himself this season. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last here is Big Papi. I acknowledge this is a generous ranking</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> in his last year before retirement, but a lock to hit 30 HR with 100 RBI in his send-off tour, he deserves nothing less.</span></p>
<p><b>Adrian Gonzalez (LAD), Prince Fielder (TEX), Kendrys Morales (KC)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Adrian Gonzalez is a pure line-drive hitter that stabilizes the middle of the Dodgers lineup. Unfortunately he is on the wrong side of 30 and although a proven fantasy asset he does not offer the same potential as other options. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Prince Fielder is in a similar situation. He bounced back nicely at the start of last season from neck surgery but failed to maintain that performance in the second half of the season. He can hit when he stays healthy but, like Gonzalez, his best years are behind him. </span></p>
<p>Morales is aging too. Now 33 he has seen his peak years in the rear-view mirror. He remains a is a solid utility option that can boost the HR, RBI categories while maintaining a respectable batting average.</p>
<p><b>Albert Pujols (LAA), Brandon Belt (SF), Carlos Santana (CLE)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pujols will provide power and power. His line drive rate was its lowest in five years last season (16%) as he hit for an abysmal .244 batting average. He did hit 40 home runs last year, but at 36 years old he is no longer the machine he once was. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Belt is the youngest of the group that is a contributor when on the field. But concussion problems are well-noted and make him a wild card at this point. This is confusing option for fantasy owners. A line drive hitter with some contact issues at timees, he offers surplus value if he falls in the draft because of health concerns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The last on the list is Carlos Santana. He fits a power profile with a lack of batting average but supports his value with very good OBP and the opportunity he will have to drive in runs from his spot in the Indians&#8217; lineup. </span></p>
<p><b>Mark Teixeira (NYY), Evan Gattis (HOU)</b></p>
<p>I am biased against anyone on the Yankees roster but Teixeira deserves a spot on here because he&#8217;s a proven veteran that benefits from playing in the new Yankee Stadium. If he can stay on the field he offers owners a nice value pick opportunity.</p>
<p>Evan Gattis&#8217; fantasy value has dropped because of his status as a pure designated hitter with the Astros but his offensive output seemed to benefit from the change. One concern is a sports hernia that will delay his 2016 debut until after opening day. He will hurt a team&#8217;s OBP but make significant contributions in the home-run and RBI categories.</p>
<p><b>Ryan Zimmerman (WAS), Lucas Duda (NYM)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Zimmerman can find a way to stay healthy he will serve as a run producer in the heart of the National&#8217;s lineup this season. The problem is his health; he hasn’t logged over 400 at-bats in either of the last two season so it’s hard to anticipate a valuable season from him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Teixeria&#8217;s New York City counterpart, Luca Duda, is a pure power hitter. He won&#8217;t hit for an average but has shown promising improvement in his OBP over the last few years and is a mid-level fantasy option </span></p>
<hr />
<p>This class of first basemen offer owners a wide range of quality options depending on the roster you have put together. At the top are bonafide fantasy baseball studs that can anchor a team through the season, and are absolute keepers worthy of top draft picks. If you miss out on those guys and get your fantasy star at another position there are other first basemen that make solid contributions. As expected, most of these guys will produce for power categories like home runs, and RBI and can provide decent production in a utility role for almost any team.</p>
<p><strong>Fishing for Prospects: A.J. Reed (HOU)</strong></p>
<p>If you only take only one thing away from this entire series, let it be this name because A.J. Reed is poised for stardom. He was selected 42nd overall selection in the 2014 MLB draft after a stunning season at Kentucky that culminated in the Golden Spikes Award. That season he led the nations in home runs with 23 with a .336 batting average, and also contributed a 12-2 record on the mound with a 2.09 ERA and 71 strikeouts. The Astros player development staff decided to commit to Reed as a hitter and he thrived in the Class A Advanced California league before earning a promotion to Double-A in the second half of the season. Headed in to 2015 the Astros have other options ahead of him, but depending on how spring training unfolds Reed may get a shot to prove himself with the major league club as soon as this season.</p>

Initial speculation focused on Al Horford and Jeff Teague but as the deadline approached another blockbuster deal developed. Unfortunately for Celtics fans the front office kept the details confidential.</p>
<p>During a recent appearance on WEEI&#8217;s OM&amp;F, Celtics&#8217; President of Basketball Operations Danny Ainge confirmed that a deal was &#8220;very close&#8221; to transpiring until the other team backed out in the final moments. The target of this deal, Ainge revealed, was the Sixers&#8217; 20 year old center Jahlil Okafor.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Ainge did not divulge and the exact specifics of the deal remain a mystery. It is safe to presume the deal involved the Nets&#8217; highly coveted first round selection in the upcoming draft and possibly David Lee&#8217;s contract, but the details of the agreement remain subject to speculation. In any case this revelation from Ainge is a very interesting development for eager Celtics fans.</p>
<p>Okafor is raw low-post presence with the opportunity at greatness and stardom. Renown among local sports fans for his involvement in a bar fight in Boston after their game against the Celtics at the start of the season, the 20 year old rookie has plenty of time to mature and develop. This will need to happen both on and off the basketball court. On the court he has, statistically, been quite impressive in his rookie campaign despite the deplorable Sixers&#8217; record. In 48 appearances so far this year the Duke product has averaged 17.1 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 1.2 blocks in his 30.2 minutes per game.</p>
<p>The idea of Jahlil Okafor on this young roster is unexpected yet captivating. Imagine adding his presence to the Celtics&#8217; front court? It would add a dimension to the offense that this team lacks. As a go-to scorer and quality rebounder in the paint, the only concerns about Okafor emerge on defensive side of the basketball. He has always been such a physical superior among his peers that his lack of technique and awareness were never at risk of exploitation. Now that he has finally reached the NBA these aspects of his game need polish, but if he puts in the hard work both are skills that can develop and improve.</p>
<p>As Celtics fans let&#8217;s hope the Sixers&#8217; don&#8217;t fully default on their interest in a deal involving Okafor. There is a lot left to be determined between now and the NBA draft, and even more rime before the start of the next season; this trade could still materialize. In the mean time we should cross our fingers and trust in Ainge&#8217;s ability to entice the Sixers because Okafor is a generational talent who could address an important void in the Celtics roster.</p>

A highly touted infielder for his natural athleticism and raw power, Chavis has yet to live up to the high expectations.</p>
<p>He has a balanced stance from the right handed batters box with his hands steady at shoulder level, and starts his swing with a short, quite stride. He unleashes his hands through the zone with impressive bat speed and scouts regard his raw power potential.</p>
<p>Growing up Chavis played primarily shortstop but when he was draft it was unclear whether he would stick at the position long-term. Last season Red Sox management decided to move him to third-base on a permanent based on their projection of Chavis&#8217; player profile. Unfortunately this transition has not gone smoothly as hoped.</p>
<p>In 39 games at the end of 2014 in rookie league with the GCL Red Sox, he had a decent performance but was not overwhelming. He spent time at both shortstop and third-base in that campaign and posted a respectable .767 OPS with one home-run and 16 RBI.  His trouble was in the field as he made seven errors in 39 games. Then last year, with the class-A Greenville Drive, he seemed to regress further. In 68 games at the hot corner he made 19 errors resulting in a dismal .907 fielding percentage. Chavis needs to work on his technique at the new position and it must be addressed if he wants to progress as a professional, but it is a skill that he can explicitly focus on and improve if he puts in the hard work.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the 20 year old prospect is heralded for his ability to hit the long-ball. Last season with the Drive he hit 16 home-runs and posted an impressive .182 ISO. The concern however is his approach in the batter&#8217;s box; although he hit those home runs, he appended the power output with a lousy 67% contact rate and 6% walk rate. This led to a disquieting .223/.277/.405 slash line.</p>
<p>In his limited professional exposure there are no doubts about Chavis&#8217; power, but the lack of plate discipline and feel for the strike-zone leave more to be desired. This is an aspect of baseball that does not come naturally to many but often improves as players accrue more plate appearances. It clicks for some prospects and not for others so by no means a presumed outcome for Chavis. He really needs to address this facet of his offensive toolbox if he wants to keep up his prospect stock.</p>
<p>Chavis is remains a young prospect very early in his development and despite last year&#8217;s struggles has plenty of time to improve upon the flaws in his game. Raw power is a valued tool in the baseball industry and there is no doubt he has it. 2016 is an important year for him as a professional and he needs to establish himself as a contributor in the Greenville lineup.</p>
<p>He remains years away from a debut at Fenway Park and hasn&#8217;t earned spotlight recognition from Red Sox Nation, but prospect junkies will be sure to have an eye on him in the next few of years. If he addresses the holes in his game and develops as a player I will expect to see him at Hadlock Field by late 2017 or early 2018.</p>

It assumes a 16 team mixed-league <strong>keeper</strong> format with a standard 5&#215;5 scoring system and a 22 man roster with the following positional requirements: C (1), 1B (1), 2B (1), 3B (1), SS (1), CI (1), MI (1), OF (3), UT (3), SP (5), RP (4). </span><span style="font-weight: 400">All statistical information is referenced from FanGraphs.com. </span>As the title of the post suggests, today we will start by focusing on the catchers.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Buster Posey (SF)</strong></p>
<p>This guy is the cream of the crop and has been for years now. He has lifetime batting average above .300 against both right handed (RHP) and left handed pitching (LHP), and makes consistent hard contact at the plate. Posey is the heart and soul of the San Francisco Giants and, given his durability and ability to play first-base, is a lock for 500+ at-bats per year. His profile stands alone in the catcher rankings once again this season.</p>
<p><strong>Kyle Schwarber (CHC), Brian McCann (NYY)</strong></p>
<p>Schwarber is a lock for keeper leagues. He may lose his catcher eligibility after this season, but no matter where he plays and whether he learns how to hit for a higher average, he has elite power.</p>
<p>Then there is McCann who has caught more MLB games than Schwarber has played in total. I put him in the category because he is a proven asset. Another plus: his average fly ball ratio over the past three seasons lends itself to some juicy slugging potential at Yankee Stadium. Schwarber will go much earlier in the draft because of his keeper prospects and a bullish market, so McCann may offer the better value pick of the two.</p>
<p><strong>Travis D&#8217;Arnaud (NYM), Jonathan Lucroy (MIL)</strong></p>
<p>These two are high risk, high reward players. They both have concerning injury histories (D&#8217;Arnaud more so than Lucroy) and the latter has openly stated his desire to leave Milwaukee. Neither of these are promising developments for fantasy owners. D&#8217;Arnaud has a higher ceiling of the two if you&#8217;re willing to take the chance, but neither are comfortable picks.</p>
<p><strong>Salvador Perez (KC), Russell Martin (TOR), J.T. Realmuto (MIA)</strong></p>
<p>Perez plays nearly every inning for the Royals and although his walk rate somehow fell to just 2% last, his consistent contact rate (86%) and line drive tendency (21%) over the past three seasons show the potential to continue to succeed.</p>
<p>Russell Martin took his talents to Canada in 2015 and once again produced solid numbers. While is high home-run to fly-ball ratio last season (21%) suggests some power regression and he struggled against right-handed pitching last year, Martin is the workhorse for Toronto whose offensive output will get help from that potent lineup.</p>
<p>This last player in this tier is Realmuto. He may not sound familiar but remember the name. Only 24 years old, he has been a line drive hitter in his two seasons in MLB (27%) and makes consistent contact (82%). On top of the intriguing bat tool, he runs very well for a catcher and a 10+ SB season is conceivable.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Vogt (OAK),  Nick Hundley (COL), Welington Castillo (AZ)</strong></p>
<p>Vogt stands out statistically among these three but his struggles against left-handed pitching last season (.631 OPS) could land him in a platoon role for the Athletics this year.</p>
<p>Rockies&#8217; starting catcher Nick Hundley had the best season of his career in 2015 with a .300 batting average and 10 HR. He has historically been a better hitter against RHP in his career, but in the second half of last season exploded for a .915 OPS against LHP after managing a mere .575 OPS in the first half. Don&#8217;t expect a full repeat of 2015, but if he can carry this success against RHP in to this season Hundley will have a productive season at Coors Field.</p>
<p>Finally, Castillo. He didn&#8217;t show the ability to make consistent contact last year (73%) but the 2015 ISO of .216 demonstrates his raw power. He has the potential to hit 15-20 HR, especially at Chase Field.</p>
<p><strong>Miguel Montero (CHC), Yasmani Grandal (LAD), Blake Swihart (BOS), Yadier Molina (STL)</strong></p>
<p>Montero and Grandal are both mid-level power options that won&#8217;t hit for much of an average. Montero simultaneously had his contact rate drop to 70% and line drive rate rise to 26% last season, which led to a substantial power increase.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at 27 years old, Grandal has had trouble making contact over the past three season (73%) and hits for a low batting average. He is the starting&#8217; catcher for the Dodgers, but A.J Ellis is sure to take some at bats. Swihart is in this tier because of his keeper value. He is a blossoming hitter and has above average speed for a catcher. The problem in the short term is Red Sox&#8217;s catching depth, as he and Vasquez will likely to split the bulk of the time this season.</p>
<p>Then there is Yadier Molina. Long gone are the days of Molina&#8217;s fantasy prominence. He has proven himself a line drive hitter that makes consistent contact, but he is no longer going to provide double digit home runs. Will play every day if he avoids injury, but don&#8217;t expect the Yadi of the past.</p>
<p><strong>Derek Norris (SD), Francisco Cervelli (PIT), Yan Gomes (CLE)</strong></p>
<p>Yan Gomes has injury history that is worrisome, and while he has hit a lot of line drives in the last two seasons (25%), his low contact (71%) and walk (3%) rates do not show me a comfortable hitter at the plate.</p>
<p>Cervelli will catch everyday for the Pirates IF he can stay healthy, but that is a big if. His high contact (78%) and line drive rates (25%) produce a high average but the problem is he is a one category contributor.</p>
<p>Norris, conversely, had trouble making contact last season (75%) and exhibited a troubling platoon split (810 OPS vL, 678 OPS  vR), neither of which inspire optimism. Austin Hedges and Christian Bethancourt are knocking on the door for his duties and a platoon in San Diego is the likely conclusion this season.</p>
<p><strong>Devin Mesoraco (CIN), Wilson Ramos (WAS)</strong></p>
<p>Devin Mesoraco, like Yan Gomes, is another risky player. I&#8217;m staying away him because of his low line drive (13.9%) and hard-hit ball rates (19.4%) in limited time at the end of last season. He is also coming off of hip surgery. He offers potential but has a lot to prove.</p>
<p>Wilson Ramos seems to be on the decline as well. His contact rate has plummeted in each of the past two seasons and his average ground ball rate over the past three seasons (56%) does not suggest a power rebirth. What keeps owners interested in both of these catchers is the potential power output, but it does not look promising.</p>
<hr />
<p>Get a top tier catcher or you&#8217;ll be fighting for the best of the worst. A common theme among the is consistency vs high risk, high reward. I tend to favor consistency at the catcher position, but it all depends on your strategy as an owner. My player to target from this list is J.T. Realmuto. He will handle the primary catching responsibilities for the Marlins this year and is potential keeper who could produce 15 HR and 10 SB for years to come.</p>
<p><strong>Fishing for Prospects:</strong></p>
<p>Before concluding each week, there will be a prospect you should keep an eye on throughout this season as a potential keeper for your team down the road. Depending on how many keepers your league allows this portion may or may not offer relevance. Fair warning on looking for keepers at the catcher position &#8211; they&#8217;re very rarely a good investment.</p>
<p><strong>Reese McGuire (PIT)</strong></p>
<p>The Pirates selected McGuire out of Kentwood Senior High School in Washington with 14th overall in the first round of the 2013 MLB draft. Now just age 20, McGuire has progressed smoothly in his two seasons of professional baseball and played last season in the Advanced Class-A Florida State League. The Pirates developmental philosophy for catchers stresses defense over offense, which McGuire as bought in to. This may hinder his progression as a hitter but puts him on a faster track to make his debut at PNC Park. McGuire&#8217;s naturally advanced, high contact approach from the left-hand batters box offers promise as a hitter, and with more time to develop he could become a strong catcher in MLB. Don&#8217;t expect him on the Pirates roster this year, but down the road McGuire is a name to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>We will move on to first-basemen next week.</p>

Although the Celtics have been involved in many rumors they have yet to make a deal. This particular option, if completed for both players, would put the Celtics on a win-now path with championship aspiration in the near future.</p>
<p>The positive attributes of Horford are renown around the NBA. He is proven winner, has averaged 14.3 points and 9 rebounds over his career, and would fill the vacancy at the center position that I covered <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2016/01/07/the-celtics-need-a-center/">here</a> last month. This is not a knock on Amir Johnson, I love the way he plays, but Al Horford is a big improvement. He is 29 years old, is a presence on the glass, and can get a bucket in post when his team needs it. He is exactly what the Celtics are lacking. The negative aspect of a trade involving Horford is his contract. This is the final year of his current deal and he is expecting to get a significant salary in free agency this summer. If the Celtics were to pull the trigger on a deal for Horford, Ainge would either have the upmost confidence in the team&#8217;s ability to sign him to a contract extension or be sending a message loud and clear that the goal is to win <em>this </em>year.</p>
<p>Teague is an electric athlete and has shown the ability to both score the basketball and run an offense at the NBA level. The Wake Forest product, now 27 years old, has averaged 11.8 points and 5.1 assists per game over his career, and his current contract is worth $8 million per year for both this season and next. Not a bad deal for a really good point guard. The only problem with his addition to the roster is that he would join an already crowded back court. The guard position does not feel like a pressing need for the Celtics at this point, which makes this rumor puzzling unless the front office plans to completely reconstruct this lineup mid season.</p>
<p>Danny Ainge has shown the guts and willingness to make this type of deal and go all-in for a championship, but has shown patience with player development and &#8216;trusting the process&#8217; with young guys. Is the goal to win a championship this year? If so, then this trade will certainly move the team toward that goal. Also, is the front office that confident in their ability to sign Horford to a contract extension after this season? Another essential consideration when weighing this deal. If not, then a one year window of return is not an optimal return. It all remains to be seen and or now Celtics fans can only wait anxiously. Ainge is a diligent general manager and will surely consider every and any possible option before making a decision. In the meantime, we should continue to foster the hope of a DeMarcus Cousins-Isaiah Thomas reunion in a green and white uniform.</p>

Even when it is the Celtics. I&#8217;ve written a couple posts about them, but I lack the same passion that I have for baseball. So, in response to this epiphany, I have decided to start a new segment for spring training focused on Red Sox prospects. These are some guys that Red Sox Nation should keep their eyes on in this spring and in the coming years. Because of all the hype Yoan Moncada and Rafael Devers have gotten since his signing I will skip him and save you the redundancy by simply saying: they are <strong>really</strong> promising prospects. To lead off the series this week&#8217;s post will feature Venezuelan RHP Anderson Espinoza, who was recently rated the #39 on the 2016 MLB Top Prospect List.</p>
<p>The Red Sox signed the 16-year old Espinoza for $1.8 million in the summer of 2014. At the time he threw his fastball 90-92, with a decent slider and makings of a change-up. In this past season at 17 years of age, his first as a professional in the United States, he was sitting 94-96 on the gun and touching 98. Pretty good for the equivalent of a junior in high school.</p>
<p>Espinoza has a wiry build at 6 feet tall and 170 pounds and looks like natural athlete on the mound. From the windup he as a simple low leg rock with an ever so slight pause at the top before he break his hands. This simple, efficient motion helps him repeat his delivery well for someone his age. Up to this point in his life he has been able to rely heavily on his explosive fastball without much need for a secondary pitch, and had a thorough debut in Rookie and low Class-A ball last year to the tone of a 2.16 ERA in the 15 starts. The next step in his progression will be to put on some muscle, develop a feel for his change-up and, like every young pitcher, improve his command of all three pitches.</p>
<p>Red Sox fans should not expect Espinoza to debut at Fenway Park anytime soon. He needs to put on some mass and develop as pitcher not just a thrower. It is likely he needs time in Class-A ball for a year or so before coming to Portland, but even that may still keep him on pace to debut at Fenway before his first legal beer. Expect him to start the year in Greenville with a possible of promotion to Salem by the end of the season. Plans for Espinoza are long term because he is so young, but with a special talent like his the sky is the limit.</p>
