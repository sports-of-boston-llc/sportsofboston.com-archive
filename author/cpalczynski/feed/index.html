For those who did not see, Eduardo Rodriguez pitched well over five and a third innings, but was pulled after recording an out, leaving the bases loaded for Tommy Layne, a below average middle reliever.</p>
<p>Layne promptly gave up six runs without recording an out, and when Farrell pulled him, Robbie Ross Jr. gave up another two, putting the game way out of reach, and embarrassing the Red Sox on national TV.</p>
<p>As frustrating as watching that game was, even a casual fan had to wonder why Farrell decided to get involved. Rodriguez&#8217;s pitch count was up, but should the manager have given him a chance to get out of the inning with the bottom of the order coming up? Perhaps yes, perhaps no. But if pulling him was the right decision, then-why Layne? Ziegler is your ground ball guy. Layne is the guy you put into a game that is already out of reach, and when it comes to the Kansas City Royals, a two run lead does not put a game out of reach. Citation: their eight runs in that same inning.</p>
<p>Farrell&#8217;s managing abilities come into question seemingly daily, taking off some of the pressure of under-performing Sox. Regardless, the fact remains-if this teams expects to advance past the ALDS, or take the AL East, their bullpen must show some backbone and record some important outs.</p>

Mostly, I felt for the Sox themselves and how they must have been feeling. As daunting as it seemed, the forecast only got worse as the Red Sox had to play a one o&#8217; clock game in Detroit after a night game in Baltimore, leaving the Sox with four cities in six days.</p>
<p>The sweep preceding this awful road trip was a good morale boost for the streaky Sox, who were not having a great month up to that point. When the Diamondbacks came to town, I believed the Sox would take two out of three, but they played great and swept Arizona out of the stadium. The next night, in Cleveland, Drew Pomeranz (finally) pitched a gem, and gave the Red Sox their fourth win in a row, and his first in a Boston uniform. All was well so far, but the next two nights, the Orioles loomed large.</p>

After a dismal road-trip, the Red Sox failed to improve on their record in a series against the Yankees, and now sit at only nine games above .500.</p>
<p>The playoff picture in the East is tight as it will ever be, with the Sox three games behind the Jays, and 2.5 behind the Orioles. At the moment, the Red Sox hold a .5 game lead over the Tigers for the second spot in the race for the second wild card berth. A poor series against a .500 team was the last thing David Ortiz and Co. needed, but regardless, it is what they got.</p>
<p>With a team as streaky as this, it&#8217;s feasible to consider the possibility that they might go on another tear, and finish the season with breathing room in any playoff race. However, sports in the Boston media remain ever-reactionary, and the flavor of the past ten games has been doom. It is always difficult to remain positive, after the stretch the Sox have most recently suffered through.</p>
<p>One of the bright spots on the team has been newcomer Andrew Benintendi. Unfortunately, the key word in the sentence prior is &#8220;newcomer&#8221;. All rookies are bound to make mistakes, or have a &#8220;welcome to the League&#8221; moment. Benintendi&#8217;s simply came during a crucial moment in the game.</p>
<p>For those watching, it was next to unbelievable. A seemingly playable, albeit sharply, hit ball by Jacoby Ellsbury quickly made it&#8217;s way into left field, prompting a quick response by Benintendi. The ball went mere centimeters over the 22 year old, and Ellsbury was safely aboard with a double, driving in two. Those two runs proved insurmountable in the eighth and the ninth for the Sox, who once again left the field with a heartbreaking loss.</p>
<p>Heartbreaking losses are acceptable in a season of 162 games, but at the rate they are coming lately to this team, one has to wonder if this is truly a team built for postseason success. All outside factors point to yes, with phenoms X, Betts, JBJ, and now Benintendi-but close games, especially during the postseason-are must-wins.</p>

Photo: Joe Nicholson, USA Today Sports" ></a><p>If anyone from New England stayed up till one in the morning to watch the Red Sox lose six out of eleven games on the West Coast, then&#8230;sorry. However, you were not alone, and you were also not alone if you felt frustration and anxiety as the Sox quietly ducked out of a playoff spot for the first time since April.</p>
<p>Now that all is said and done, the Red Sox sit three games out of first place in the AL East and a half game behind the Deroit Tigers for the second wild-card spot.</p>
<p>Opposite-coast games are tough for any team, but when you pair the exhaustion of eleven games in eleven nights-after a six hour flight from Boston, in which three different ballparks were visited-and, incredibly, the fact that the Sox have had to endure 43 games in 44 days-their toil is understandable.</p>
<p>The one off-day the Red Sox get in the midst of their mind-bending stretch comes today-and they get to relax on yet another long flight, this time back to Boston to take on the Yankees the next night. The six-game homestand is much needed, as the Sox will soon be on the road again for another 11 games, in four cities.</p>
<p>A few months ago, the entire city of Boston seemed confident in the Red Sox and their playoff chances. Now, with a little less than two months to go, hope is dwindling. If the Red Sox can manage to take four or five of six from the Yankees and Dbacks-a highly achievable goal, temperaments will improve, but the outlook after their next eleven game set on the road remains to be seen.</p>
<p>A few more thoughts&#8230;1. Why can David Price not get to ten wins? Who pitches for the Sox in a one-game playoff? 2. A-Rod finally stepping away from the diamond. One more series at Fenway? 3. ESPN can&#8217;t help but make sure that JBJ is always in the headlines as a trade candidate in the offseason. 4. Benintendi worth the wait so far.</p>

Moncada would command a king&#8217;s ransom at the deadline, and he is certainly a player that the Sox will be hoping to use next season. When the Cuban signed for $31.5 million, few were expecting him to rise as quickly as he did to Double-A ball, but the 21 year old has shown he is already worth the huge amount of cash.</p>
<p>Moncada is listed as the number 5 prospect in Major League Baseball, and his scouting report draws comparisons to Robinson Cano (with more speed). Paired with Andrew Benintendi, the number 21 overall prospect, the future in Boston is bright.</p>
<p>So, where does that leave the Red Sox next year? Some players and their positions are set in stone, such as Bogaerts at shortstop and JBJ in center. The areas of need, if one is to nitpick, would be left field, third base, and first base.</p>

<p>June is firmly in the rearview mirror for the suddenly wicked hot Boston Red Sox, and for at least 24 hours, doubts and criticisms have been silenced.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, the Red Sox needed only a one-run home run from Brock Holt to take the victory, but they graciously accepted a three run shot from Big Papi to provide all the run support that Rick Porcello would need. Porcello looked strong, earned his tenth straight win at home, and the Sox shut out the team with the best record in the majors. It was a feel good win, reminiscent of Octobers past, and indicative of Octobers future.</p>

<p>The blast was number 526 for David, who was recently placed at number 78 on ESPN&#8217;s list of greatest baseball players of all time.</p>
<p>Consider last night just another day in the office in this man&#8217;s fabled baseball career. He owns this city, just as Tom Brady owns the NFL. So, does Dave Dombrowski have a case to bring back Big Papi for 2017? A few months ago, the answer would undoubtedly have been no, but with the second half of the season well underway, there has been some indecisiveness. Nothing definitive has been said regarding one more year for the 40 year old, but there is an air of hope for the Fenway faithful.</p>

Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski, to be specific. The pair has combined for 65 touchdowns throughout the seven years Gronkowski has been in the league, titanic numbers for two players that were not drafted in the first round. Compare those 65 touchdowns to Joe Montana and Jerry Rice, who scored 67 times together (over nine years).</p>
<p>Are Gronk and Brady the best QB-TE duo of all time? Yes. Are they the best QB-receiver duo of all time? Most likely not (this year), but if the production stays at a high level, expect Brady and Gronk to finish with around 90 total touchdown connections.</p>
<p>These stats and more contribute to the reasoning behind NFL players voting for the QB in the two spot, and the tight end in the nine spot. Both are well-deserved, and some Patriots fans expressed distaste that Gronk was not higher, above players such as Julio Jones and Aaron Rodgers.</p>
<p>Also making the list was Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman, coming off a season hindered by a broken foot. Edelman, once described as the toughest cover in the NFL, is the type of blue collar worker that New Englanders love. Number eleven takes hits across the middle, has a nose for the end zone, and always places the team first. His true return this year, as opposed to his return in the postseason against KC, should bring about another 7 touchdowns for himself and Brady, once Brady returns in week 5 against Cleveland. Edelman cracked the list at number 87.</p>

<p>This game held special meaning for David Ortiz, the AL DH. In his final season, and final all star game, Ortiz was the starter for the AL at DH. While Ortiz was certainly the man of the hour, it was his Red Sox counterparts that actually outperformed Papi in San Diego.</p>
<p>Ortiz went 0 for 1, with a walk, and was pulled shortly thereafter. Xander Bogaerts, Mookie Betts, and JBJ all had at least one hit, contributing to the 4-2 victory over the NL.</p>
<p>Xander smacked a double down the left field line, Betts singled and scored, and Jackie Bradley sent two singles through the infield.</p>
<p>Eric Hosmer was the game&#8217;s MVP, who homered and drove in two runs.</p>
<p>The Red Sox are back in action tonight, taking on the Yankees in the Bronx. Eduardo Rodriguez is starting for the Red Sox.</p>
<p>The Red Sox are doing well so far in July. It has been no secret that pitching has been holding this team back. As previously spoken about on SOB, Dave Dombrowski traded Anderson Espinoza, the number one pitching prospect for the Red Sox to San Diego for Drew Pomeranz, who is likely to be the number two or three starter for Boston moving forward.</p>
<p>The Red Sox also managed to sign their first round draft pick, Jason Groome, to a $3.65 million contract, pending a physical.</p>

Leon Halip (Getty Images)" ></a><p>Six Red Sox players were recently named to the All-Star team, with Dustin Pedroia currently on the outside looking in. Starting for the Red Sox in San Diego will be David Ortiz (DH), Xander Bogaerts (SS), Mookie Betts (OF), and Jackie Bradley Jr. (OF). Pitchers selected from the Red Sox include Steven Wright and Craig Kimbrel.</p>
<p>Five of the aforementioned names should have almost been shoo-ins. Ortiz, at 40, is hitting at an unbelievable rate. Bogaerts is clearly the best shortstop in the AL. Betts and Bradley Jr. have been impeccable in the outfield, and both are exceeding all expectations at the plate. Steven Wright&#8217;s ERA is 2.68, second in the AL.</p>
<p>But then there is one more name: Craig Kimbrel, who was acquired by the Red Sox for four prospects in the offseason. San Diego rightly touted him as the best closer in baseball, and at that point in time, it certainly seemed he was. When Boston brought him in, he was portrayed as a bullpen stabilizer and lock-down pitcher in the media.</p>
<p>When Kimbrel is called upon, who shows up on the mound might be based upon the score. From Scott Lauber (ESPN): &#8220;In save situations this season, Kimbrel has allowed nine hits and three walks in 18 2/3 innings, with 27 strikeouts and a 1.45 ERA. But in non-save situations, he has allowed 12 hits and 10 walks in 13 1/3 innings, with 21 strikeouts and a 6.75 ERA&#8221;.</p>
<p>These stats never shined brighter when Kimbrel faced the Rangers this week with a 3-2 Red Sox deficit. Kimbrel got zero outs, and gave up four runs, turning a potentially winnable game into an unwinnable one for the Red Sox, who are in dire need of wins.</p>
<p>So, is Kimbrel All-Star worthy? Is he worth the four prospects? Maybe. Some would argue that his 17 saves in 19 opportunities is respectable enough for a nod. But not many.</p>
