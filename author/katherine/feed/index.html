				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/llws09/news/story?id=4414291">Former Red Sox player and Hall of Famer, Jim Rice</a>, currently finds himself amidst a self-created controversy for singling out Manny Ramirez, Alex Rodriguez, and Derek Jeter as bad influences on America’s youth while at the Little League World Series this past weekend. Rice compared current MLB players to those of his generation, citing that “dread locks and baggy clothes” contribute to the “bad example” that these players set. </p>
<p>Since when do athletes having dreadlocks cause a negative influence on children? Does an athlete’s hairstyle have that much power? Children did not run to grocery stores to buy green and pink hair dye when they saw <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/players/stats?playerId=726">Dennis Rodman</a> playing for the Bulls. There are plenty of other current professional athletes who sport dreadlocks or long hair, such as Pittsburgh Steelers safety, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?playerId=4474">Troy Polamalu</a>. Is he also a bad influence on children? No. A child is not going to join a gang or meddle in drugs just because he sees an athlete with dreadlocks and baggy pants at a baseball game.<br />

The Huskies had a dismal <a href="http://gonu.com/football/2008/fb08-12.shtml">2-10 record</a>, finishing 1-7 in the Colonial Athletic Association and last in the CAA North. Both the offensive and defensive teams seemed to be absent from the field last year, only showing up to play in the games against UC Davis and Towson. There were several embarrassing losses: to UMass, UNH, Maine, William and Mary, and especially, Hofstra, where up to 523 yards were allowed to the opposing team. Although Northeastern said goodbye to 13 seniors, several changes and additions have been made to the offense, defense, and personnel that can only help the Huskies at this point.</p>
<p><a href="http://gonu.com/football/090204-huskies_announce_2009_recruiting_class.shtml">12 new freshmen</a> were added to the roster, hailing from all over the East Coast; most of the new athletes received either city, regional, or state honors during their high school careers. The freshmen were all leaders on their high school teams and will carry this mentality with them when they put on their Husky jerseys. They will play as defensive linesman, linebackers, offensive lineman, wide receiver, tight end, and quarterback. Coach Rocky Hager and the Huskies will receive additional help from new coaching additions, <a href="http://gonu.com/football/coaches/fb-hetherman.shtml">Corey Hetherman </a>and <a href="http://gonu.com/football/coaches/fb-forcucci.shtml">Frank Forucci</a>.</p>

NBA point guard Stephon Marbury has a 24-hour live video chat on the Web site, Justin.tv. On his channel, “<a href="http://www.justin.tv/starburytv">Starbury TV</a>,” viewers can see him dancing, eating Vaseline, and offering words of wisdom to the public. Those who view these videos are incredibly perplexed by his ludicrous actions and must be wondering if he is crazy or just desperately trying to get signed. In this case, one has definitely flown over the cuckoo’s nest.</p>
<p>In his dance video, he is one of the many to give a subtle tribute to Michael Jackson, dancing shirtless to MJ while wearing a facial mask in his bathroom. While this may not be as frightening as Shaq in the film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116756/">Kazaam</a>, his following videos caused some to wonder if he is on a drug binge or suffering from mental problems.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/07/30/starbury-tv-stephon-marbury-crazy-or-genius/">Starbury TV: Stephon Marbury Crazy or Genius?</a> (326 words)</p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>Some people, such as Michael Irvin, an NFL Hall of Famer, have glorified Vick lately for his past career in the NFL. So, does anyone actually remember what it was like when Vick played as quarterback for the Falcons? The victorious seasons? There were few. 2004 was the only season that he can pride himself on, as the Falcons went 11-5.(...)<br/>Read the rest of <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2009/07/23/anyone-want-to-take-a-bite-out-of-michael-vick/">Anyone Want to Take a Bite Out of Michael Vick?</a> (288 words)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Denver Broncos and Kansas Chiefs recently acquired former Patriots personnel to help revive both AFC West teams. The Broncos picked up Josh McDaniels as head coach, and players Jabar Gaffney and LaMont Jordan. The Chiefs picked up Matt Cassel and Mike Vrabel, as well as Scott Pioli as the new general manager. Many are wondering, who will have the most successful season?</p>
<p>McDaniels’ eight-year career with the Patriots gives him the proper knowledge and tools necessary to strengthen the Broncos. He first worked as a personnel assistant in the scouting department, having little influence. In 2005, the Pats were number two in the NFL in offensive passing while McDaniels was quarterback coach. He then took over as offensive coordinator, placing him in a position of power. During this period he worked with Gaffney, a wide receiver, and Jordan, a running back. McDaniels had one of the most productive offenses in NFL history during the 2007 season where Gaffney and others helped the Patriots achieve 75 touchdowns and 589 points. Although Jordan only played in eight games in 2008, he had 80 rushes for 363 yards with four touchdowns. Both Gaffney and Jordan know what McDaniels expects from them on the field and carry this knowledge with them to Denver. The Chiefs are also welcoming their new additions.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This fall will mark Tedy Bruschi’s fourteenth and possibly final season as a New England Patriots linebacker. Once his contract is fulfilled, the question is, where does he go from here? The idea of retirement is looming in the air.</p>
<p>When the Patriots drafted him in 1996, Bruschi looked great on paper. While playing college football for Arizona, he had a total of 185 tackles and fifty-two sacks. He was an All-American who had several Pac-10 honors under his belt. He proved his skills as a defensive player during his rookie year for the Pats when he had two sacks during the ’96 playoffs. However, as successful Bruschi was as a rookie, his next few seasons showed a certain amount of inconsistency in his performance.<br />
