		<description><![CDATA[And yet another article slamming TA - is it any wonder that he chose to leave?

Tony CAN shoot - Tony dunked to bring some excitement to an otherwise dysfunctional crowd....sitting on their rears - that was what he was doing when he hurt himself.

I like Boston - but not giving Tony three years was an insult.  If Tony had played more in game 7, the Celtics might have had another championship.

And Tony DOES play offense....remember 15 points to carry the team in Round 1 or 2? hmmm - but with the ball hogs on the Celtics; Tony chooses to play TEAM ball.]]></description>
