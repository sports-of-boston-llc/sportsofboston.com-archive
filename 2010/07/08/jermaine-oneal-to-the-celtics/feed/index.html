		<description><![CDATA[David Lee was always going to go wherever he could get paid.  You can&#039;t be a semi-skilled 20something big man, who&#039;ll be done as soon as he has his first big injury, and turn down 80 mil.  He&#039;s also got the horrible stink of losing on him, and might be soured on playing winning basketball, we&#039;ll have to see.

Yes, Jermaine O&#039;Neal sucks.  But what are we really asking him to do?  Everyone knows that Baby is the first big guy off the bench if the rotation is healthy.  Basically, we throw JON in the starting lineup for 2-3 months and ask him to play defense, get 2 blocks a game, and grab rebounds.  He&#039;s the type of guy who wasn&#039;t destined to be a #1 or #2 on a contender (that&#039;s a euphemism for choke artist); he just isn&#039;t built for it, probably because he never went to college.  BUT I think he&#039;s also the type of guy who could get energized by being around the fierce D that the Celts pride themselves on playing (...in the playoffs, at least).  Plus, there&#039;s never been a knock on JON for being lazy. In a lousy FA crop outside the first tier, and not yet desperate enough to trade for a big piece (most of whom, like Iguodala, Kirilenko, etc. will be available all year because of horrid contracts), I&#039;m fine with spending 6 mil on O&#039;Neal.  These are the type of compromise moves you gotta make when you&#039;re a team forced into keeping together a core of old guys.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very disappointing.  Another over the hill big man, who&#039;s a lazy, injury prone, underachiever with few, if any, defensive skills.  I really had hopes of getting David Lee now that Amare Stoudemire signed with New York.  About the only good thing about O&#039;Neal is that he&#039;s not Brad Davis.]]></description>
