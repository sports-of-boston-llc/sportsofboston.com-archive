		<description><![CDATA[first of all, thanks for the shout out, I appreciate it.  But that is an interesting question, almost enough so to warrant another column.  I see why it seems like this column would suggest I support that atrocity in Miami, but I can&#039;t say that I do.  Yes, it does provide a common team to hate, but Celtics fans already have that with the Lakers, who, like that Yankees, have an obnoxious owner, along with easliy hatable Phil Jackson and Kobe Bryant.

Besides, while Steinbrenner&#039;s Yankees were easy to hate, they were also good for baseball.  This decision, which I refuse to write with a capital d, could have gone another way that would still provide a target for Celtics teams to beat and could have benefitted the league.  I still maintain the Bulls with Lebron, Boozer, Rose and Noah would have been a better team, and Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh could have built a more solid team in Miami, with money to sign another elite guy, and added two more teams to gun for and boost the competition in the eastern conference.

But since you proposed the question, this comment would be pointless if you didn&#039;t respond to this with your opinion on the long-running joke that is the NBA.  This is a blog, so these kind of things are encouraged.  Feel free to weigh-in Max.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems whenever controversial figures die, especially in the sports world, former critics are forced to paint themselves into one of three corners:  sound crass and callous by criticizing the defenseless dead guy, sell out by suddenly praising one you used to critique, or say nothing.  I like the viewpoint in this commentary in that it presents a classy fourth alternative of celebrating the fact that Steinbrenner&#039;s ruthless, shrewd nature was, in the long run, good for the sport and its greatest rivalry.  

One question for the author:  does this mean you also support the collusion of Lebron, Dwayne, and Bosh in moving to  Miami because it creates a similar juggernaut empire we can all rally around hating?]]></description>
