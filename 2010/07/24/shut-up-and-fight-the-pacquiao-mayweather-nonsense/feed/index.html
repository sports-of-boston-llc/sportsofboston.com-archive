		<description><![CDATA[Could well be fight of the year, so far Pacquiao has shown he has never been afraid to stand toe to toe with every fighter he has faced.

Could he do this with a man of Margaritto stature.

That alone will be something to behold, small 5’6 guy fighting a 5’11 guy outweighing him by over a stone but the little guy is not just out boxing him he overpowering him, standing there and trading and making Marg take the backward steps and folding under the pressure.

Pacquiao is too goo for his own good, if Juan Diaz said he was going to take on Margaritto people would say it was a mammoth task and Diaz could well take a beating. This is the same Diaz who the same people say Pacquiao ducked.

This is going to be Pacquiao toughest fight and the Pacquiao vs Margarito could be FOTY]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First of all, I don&#039;t think Kickass knows what the hell he&#039;s talking about.  He must be from some Scandanavian country that knows nothing about fighting.  I truly believe this fight will eventually happen, and Pacquiao will show that he truly is the best pound for pound fighter.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[UFC Is going the way of WWF. They&#039;re all good fighters for sure; but it&#039;s becoming more and more about the spectacle. Not the fighter, not the sport. Ali, Frazier, Foreman, De la Hoya, Tyson ect. are all still household names.

UFC is only concerned about the next fights ticket sales. It has the potential to be bigger, but there are plenty of other MMA leagues all over the world. 

Boxing is a sport, UFC is people fighting. Boxing was never about who was the best &quot;fighter&quot;. It was about who was the best boxer. It was about their personalities and the game. 

Pacquiao and Mayweather are missing out big and disrespecting their sport. Marketing aside, they both need to remember why the put the gloves on in the first place. 

The best comment in this article was  If we are expected to view boxing as a legitimate sport, it can’t have two alleged best “pound-for-pound” fighters in the world&quot;. 

That&#039;s the truth, nobody would give a crap about football if every year the superbowl ended in a tie. There are too many &quot;world title&quot; belts to win, and too much speculation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with your thesis that boxing needs to get its act together and get these two guys into the ring. They have been losing ground since the 80´s.
UFC has the potential of being absolutely huge. Not only in the US, but also in Asia, South-America, Europe, almost anywhere in the world. They can, and I hope they will take boxings place as the number 1 &quot;fighting sport&quot; in the world.
The problem with it is that it does not seem to be getting the best fighters. Many analysts state that there are alot of figthers who could demolish the current UFC champions.
If UFC could get these guys, it would make it much more marketable.]]></description>
