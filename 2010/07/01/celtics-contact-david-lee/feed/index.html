		<description><![CDATA[Ken: Yeah, Lopez is a pretty awesome talent, but I think the Nets are going to hold on to him while they chase the big free agents. If they don&#039;t land anyone, they will be terrible again...and may look to move him for cap space for next offseason when Carmelo Anthony is available. In the end though, I&#039;d be willing to bet they hold on to Lopez.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d take Lee over Brad Davis any day of the week.  He&#039;d be a perfect Celtic, and much more dependable than Wallace ever was.

In reality, though, I think the Celts desperately need a center who can score some points when shooting from more than 2 feet from the basket, who doesn&#039;t set 3 or 4 illegal picks per game, who doesn&#039;t need to wind up for a dunk by putting the ball on the floor where an opposing player can steal it, and who doesn&#039;t wear a perpetual scowl that makes him an easy target for officials who don&#039;t appreciate it.  In other words, a center not named Kendrick Perkins.  Perkins seems to be the love child of every NBA announcer and is always referred to as &quot;underrated&quot;.  I don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible to underrate Kendrick Perkins enough.

How about this guy Lopez from New Jersey?  I think he&#039;s a gem in the making, and nobody seems to talk about him, probably because he plays for the Nets.  Is he available?]]></description>
