		<description><![CDATA[There were several other teams interested, including the Phillies (remember how they &quot;didn&#039;t have enough money for Lee last year&quot;), but it&#039;s all about the money, and the Yanks have it in spades.

The Angels are in the race too, though I doubt Texas will let him go to a division rival in a division in which they&#039;re competitors. The Brewers, Cubs, and Nationals are also said to be interested, but we&#039;ll see what kind of cash they have.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think Werth is a glorified J.D. Drew, but you can&#039;t have enough guys with 30-HR power and a .380 OBP. 

As for Lee, I really hope the Yankees aren&#039;t the only bidder.]]></description>
