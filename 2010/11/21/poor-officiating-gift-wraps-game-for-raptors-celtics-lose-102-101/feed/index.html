		<description><![CDATA[And it would have been taken that way had it not been for that controversial ending. No one&#039;s claiming the Celtics got every bad call against them; it&#039;s just the one at the end that had, by far, the most weight. Again, credit is clearly given for Boston&#039;s loss to the lack of free throw shooting and effort at times too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You sounded like you would leave the language at home for a second. And you are absolutely correct about the Celtics being made of mostly old guys and that Doc Rivers complains too much about the officiating.

Some calls are completely missed, whether the referees just missed it or have something else on their minds is something that only they know for sure.

Still, the referees will never change their calls, and especially with the new technical rules, the best thing to do for Doc Rivers, the Celtics, and everyone in the league is to suck it up and keep playing the game. Leave the complaining to Tommy Heinsohn and the rest of us so that we can get it out of our systems, guys.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i completely concur with this article&#039;s sentiment that celtics have lost because of the officiating. however, the angle on this statement is slightly skewed: boston has been on the positive side of nba refereeing bias for years now. this is one of the very few, select teams whose jersey grabbing, foul prone game is touted as &#039;defensive excellence&#039;. what this team gets away with is a ******* nonsense. look at the team - objectively, do you think old, fat *******s could spar with faster and more athletic individuals this league is loaded with? i think no. however, whiny coach who spends 90% of the season complaining about the officiating, and some undeserved bias gifted to geriatric boston players obviously gets it done.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, everyone feels bad when their team, regardless of which team it is, is victimized by bad calls. I certainly feel for all of you when the Raptors get a bad call, and some &quot;make-up&quot; calls during the game were certainly the wrong way to deal with it.

Additionally, bad calls are made in all sports in all parts of the game. If that one call at the end had been called a foul, or if it had been a clean steal, the game&#039;s outcome wouldn&#039;t have been questionably affected, and we wouldn&#039;t be taking pot shots at each other.

It&#039;s always the exceedingly important calls that affect a game that get the most attention.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If everyone would read the post, the officiating is only one factor, including Boston&#039;s poor free throw shooting (28/38, but Toronto was only 30/39 themselves), but a general lack of effort throughout the game. Did anyone read the second paragraph? And I do actually use Ray Allen&#039;s name at the end, not Nate Robinson. It was a combined effort of Boston&#039;s free throw shooting and lack of effort, Toronto playing hard, and poor officiating. (Which by the way was not absolute; the refs made just as many, if not more good calls. It was just the one at the end which directly affected the game&#039;s outcome, which the title refers to).

And as for the replay, the live CSNNE cameras got a close-up replay on the side of the play which clearly shows Allen getting fouled. It must be easy to be biased when your team benefits from poor calls, which the Celtics do occasionally. Maybe it&#039;s that Toronto media didn&#039;t want to show the foul clearly, so maybe you Toronto fans just aren&#039;t getting a good look. If you had the CSNNE close-up feed with Tommy Heinsohn rigorously pointing it out, you would have seen it too.

		<description><![CDATA[I read your post and the common factor in all I read was &quot;MISSED&quot;! It was not the officials that cost Boston the game. It was there misses at the free throw line that cost them the game. I understand that everyone thinks that Toronto is not a good team and everyone hates to lose to a team not as good as them but come on man. Give credit when credit is due. Toronto held their heads up and kept fighting and they wanted the win more than Boston did.
