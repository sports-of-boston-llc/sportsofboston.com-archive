		<description><![CDATA[I also agree that KG probably did call him a cancer patient. It&#039;s unfortunate. But with that being said KG&#039;s comments were made in the heat of the game, and while it may have been insensitive, trash talking is part of the game. I assume this wasn&#039;t the only insensitive thing said on the court that night.

I think the bigger story here is Villanueva using twitter to accuse KG. Can we really take his comments about &quot;getting in the ring&quot; with KG seriously when he won&#039;t even confront him about the issue face to face? let alone say it face to face to the media.

It&#039;s actually quite embarrassing. Embarrassing that Villanueva whose team btw has yet to win a game this season, would post something like this on twitter, and that this story, which really has no legs, has gotten so much coverage.

 I agree with Doc. What is said on the court between players should stay on the court.]]></description>
