		<description><![CDATA[Some good thoughts, Mat, and perhaps I am a bit anxious for the Sox&#039; staff to snap back into shape, but that&#039;s the concept of a sunk cost I keep mentioning. It doesn&#039;t matter how much you&#039;re paying guys because that money&#039;s already as good as spent because of contracts, and can&#039;t be recovered. As such, it should not affect how you decide to use them while you have them.

Or, as analysts will say, you play whoever gives you the best chance to win, not who you pay the most. That&#039;s what critics are ripping into Minnesota/Brett Favre about. And if Beckett/Papelbon/others get better next year, then obviously keep the rotation. But it couldn&#039;t hurt to keep an eye on things.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[beckett will not be a bullpen pitcher.  lee will go to either the yankees or rangers.  the red sox will most likely sign worth even though he&#039;s a greasy f-ing caveman and crawford is much better all around.  pap wont be a set-up man.  they invested too much money in him. what he needs to do is realize that his fastball isnt chapmans.  lester throws harder than him.  pap has a splitter and a chang-up, he needs hop in the delorean with Doc Brown and go find it again.  bard will be the closer eventually if he keeps up with his performance. 

honestly the sox have enough starting pitching.  buch did good this past year, but remember how he did the year before... dont jump on any wagon too soon and claim him as HOF material or anything.  one good year doesnt mean another.  lets see how things shape up.   same for wake...great the other year, not so much this year.  

i think you jumped the gun on a lot of these guys.  yes last year wasn&#039;t the best, but we still almost made the playoffs...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Again, more idiocy from those who don&#039;t recognize what must be done. Beckett is not a free agent. The Sox are not spending $17.5 million for a middle reliever. If Beckett doesn&#039;t improve (and if the other pitchers with problems don&#039;t improve), they&#039;re spending $17.5 million to miss out on the playoffs again. That&#039;s the concept of a sunk cost, which you clearly don&#039;t understand, or you just didn&#039;t read everything. That huge contract need not be motivation, but a detriment to Boston if Beckett feels he doesn&#039;t have to try as hard. And you never know which teams might still see value in the Red Sox&#039; &quot;garbage,&quot; especially if they are in even worse shape than Boston. Again, you are not responding in a civilized manner, which shows how immature you really are, much more than I could ever be. Does the fact that I don&#039;t see your face or hear your voice somehow automatically qualify you to act much worse than you would face-to-face?

And by the way, the Yankees are already trying to overpay again. They offered Derek Jeter $5 million more than he&#039;s worth PER YEAR, at least, just because he&#039;s synonymous with the Yankees, and he&#039;s cocky enough to turn them down and demand more. That&#039;s another instance of trying to buy titles right there. (Plus, C.C. Sabathia, and as I suspect, Cliff Lee.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Was this aticle written by a 12-year-old? Beckett has $87 million reasons to be motivated. Do you really think a &quot;bench or bullpen stint&quot; is necessary? That&#039;s just silly. So is most of what is written here. You talk about trading what you regard as the Red Sux garbage for All-Stars. Those are the delusional opinion of a child. You cannot trade Beckett. The absurd contract Theo gave him means he is in Boston for the next four years, minimum. You can&#039;t put him in the bullpen. How do you  justify $17.5 million for a middle reliever? It&#039;s just dumb. The Red Sox are not going to eat $70 million of that contract. You would get NOTHING in return for him. To even suggest the Reds would trade Joey Votto for ANYTHING when they have him under control for the next 2-3 years just shows you have no clue. The Red Sox could offer Bard, Ellsbury and the three best prosects in their organization for Votto and Jocketty would STILL laugh at them. The premise is absolutely moronic. 
Also, John, in the comments section, you go back to the tried and true BS of &quot;The Yankees buy everybody.&quot; Please substantiate that argument for me. You can&#039;t because it&#039;s total crap. Check the rosters from last season. The Yankees had more homegrown players on their roster than the Red Sox by a significant margin. And how many free agents did the Yankees sign last season, while Theo was opening the checkbook for Lackey, Cameron, Scutaro and Beltre? The Yankees big free-agent signing last year was Nick Johnson. 

Oh, and YankeesFaninTheBayArea is not a Yankees fan. If he was, he wouldn&#039;t talk about what the Red Sux have to do to get Cliff Lee. More BS.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Red Sox are still riding on High on their 2 world series wins, but just like in New York our fans are greedy and have the &quot;What have you done for me lately&quot; attitude. With that being said the East is going to be incredibly competive again and adding an arm like Cliff Lee&#039;s would make the Red Sox the front runners to win again. But.. the new ownership thinks they can do it by holding on to their millions and replenish the team with has beens and didn&#039;t quite pan out on other teams and fight their way to the championship with the same philosophy they had last year. And once again will come up short. As a yankee fan I like it when the Red Sox are a threat because there is nothing better than watching red sox/yankees in October. Red Sox pitching staff is hurting and the fans needs the Sox to step it up and make a run after Lee. If they dont well Cliff Lee and Sabathia would make a pretty nice 1 2 punch next year! GO YANKEES!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Imo, Beckett is through..really. He has had plenty of time to mull over his batting practice starts. I don&#039;t see him any better this year. Paps needs to get over it and has to stop pitching like Heathcliff Slocumb. Dice K ...thankx for the good year .... 2 years ago. Lester and Bucky pretty much own the starts. As far as horseface, I knew that was coming the day he signed, which I never liked in the first place. Just another signing to keep a F/A away from N.Y. awesome! With V/Mart in Detroit and rumors of the Captain possibly heading to Canada..we have Salty....lovely. Beltre heads west, whether to Oakland or Halo country I say this, spend the money smart and not on a cross-eyed CF or let Ells and Casey head to sunny S.D. If not we as a Nation will only be half way across a 2 year ride on the bridge.]]></description>
