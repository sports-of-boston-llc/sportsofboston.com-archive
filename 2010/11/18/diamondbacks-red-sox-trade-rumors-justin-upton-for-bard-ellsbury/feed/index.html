		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m guessing the 3rd team talk was in regards to Bard. They probably were looking to move another piece, like Papelbon, and get another closer/pitcher to send AZ&#039;s way.

Its still hot talk though.

Boston can only fit so many players on the field and Upton would make a big difference from his one position.

I like the Sox going hard after this trade.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Red Sox would be out of their cotton-picking minds to even consider trading three of their most promising players for Justin Upton. Go hard after A-Gon, but not with the likes of Bard, Els, and Doubrount. Keep V-Mart!]]></description>
