		<description><![CDATA[[...] A case was made at Sports of Boston over the weekend for the Red Sox pursuing New York Yankees&#8217; iconic shortstop Derek Jeter, given the free agent&#8217;s unsuccessful contract negotiations with his former team. The argument seems to have gained some sway amongst the Boston sports media, as Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy wrote in Tuesday&#8217;s edition that the Red Sox should offer him a contract, and a big one at that. His reason: &#8220;to bust pinstripe chops for all the ages.&#8221; But, as with most things Shaughnessy, the minutiae of his argument do not hold up under scrutiny. [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tim, you sound like you&#039;re trying your best not to understand our points. Just because an idea is brought up and/or entertained doesn&#039;t mean it will happen. Plus, I would love to see the Yankees run up their payroll, overtax their fans with expensive tickets and several thousand dollar turkey sandwich lunches. They&#039;ll implode themselves quickly if they do that. Let the Yankees pay one player an extra $xy million dollars per year per player just because the Red Sox kick the tires a little (a huge overreaction, if they do it). Let them have Lincecum, Sabathia, and Lee for all I care. Let them talk about eight-peating. That talk and practice worked out SO WELL for the Miami Heat.

And for that matter, you seem to be reading a lot of our articles if you think we&#039;re as useless as you say. Maybe we&#039;re good at what we do, and you just don&#039;t want to admit it because you&#039;re so pro-New York.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[NYCTim: No, I don&#039;t believe he&#039;ll entertain the idea too seriously. But, GMs make calls on all types of players all the time, even if they are just kicking the tires a bit.

You can talk contract with a player without having him sign. Hey, Teixeira did it with the Red Sox a few years ago. He came to the Sox, said &quot;what can you offer&quot; and went back to the Yankees to ask for a little more. It&#039;s free agency, and it&#039;s Jeter&#039;s right as a free agent to test the market. 

----

And on your second point...yeah, why not? If they would be so royally pissed about the Sox kicking the tires on Jeter...then isn&#039;t that my point? The Yankees can overspend all they want! Remember Carl Pavano? Jaret Wright? Jason Giambi?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow. Three article on this site and all are crap. Do you REALLY believe Theo will even pick up the phone? Put it this way, if you&#039;re going to spend $17-18 million a year on a player, would you want Derek Jeter or Carl Crawford on the Red Sux? Not even Boston fans are dumb enough to say Jeter would help more than Crawford would. Why would Theo &quot;make an offer&quot; to a player he doesn&#039;t want to sign? That&#039;s complete idiocy. If jeter says &quot;Yes,&quot; is Theo supposed to say &quot;Ohhh, we were just kidding&quot;? 

Plus, do you REALLY think Theo wants to start global thermonuclear war with the Yankees? If so, say goodbye to Cliff Lee, Carl Crawford and any other free-agent your team will even THINK about signing for the next decade. The Yankees would run their payroll up to $300 million just for the heck of it. Think about the future. Lincecum in three years? To the Yankees. Price in four years? To the Yankees. Theo would be begging players to come to Boston and being denied over and over, left to think &quot;Maybe I shouldn&#039;t have made that offer to Jeter just to rile up my idiot fans and dumber bloggers.&quot; Rather than &quot;tread softly,&quot; don&#039;t tread at all.]]></description>
