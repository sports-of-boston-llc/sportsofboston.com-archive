		<description><![CDATA[Jon Miller is excellent; I feel blessed, living in the Bay Area and listening to him five days a week all summer. (His broadcast partner here, Dave Fleming, is also outstanding; Duane Cuiper and Mike Krukow - eh, not so much.)  Joe Morgan meanwhile is not as bad as a lot of people think but not one-fiftieth as good as he thinks he is. Dan Schulman, meanwhile, is the best sports broadcaster of his generation; I can&#039;t believe ESPN took this long to give him the top job. I think it must have been a question of, &quot;How do we gracefully get rid of Joe?&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Joe Morgan was a great commentator- I&#039;m sad to see him go.  He was an extremely savy baseball player which led to some very insightful commentary from the booth.  This writer is just a BoSox homer who, like most BoSox fans, can&#039;t stand to have his team criticized.  Did Boston give up in September?  Absolutely.  Not sure why you hold a comment like that against a guy who never understood the word &quot;quit.&quot;  And I&#039;m not even a Reds fan.  ESPN doesn&#039;t bend to the masses, they bend to the extremely loud and obnoxious Northeast.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank God Joe&#039;s gone.  Nice guy, but every single point he&#039;d make, he&#039; go and repeat the point two or three times.  Joe, Mr. Redundancy, I got the memo the first time.  The new team is so insightful and articulate, especially Orel and Bobby.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Joe Morgan and Don Miller and this is my opinion, was 2 of the best BASEBALL COMMENTARY that call the game as they saw it. and all the talk about this and that don&#039;t make no sense. give these 2 men the RESPECT they deserve. also no matter who call the game today, there&#039;s always going to be a CRY BABY. WAKE AND UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You must be a Red Sux fan still bitter because your team got punked by Morgan and the Big Red Machine 35 years ago. Still funny after all these years.  Apparently, your team&#039;s centennial world series win and attempt to buy another one isn&#039;t good enough (what a bunch of hypocrites!)
Have fun listening to the two babbling, egotistical &quot;geniuses&quot; ESPN has in the booth now. Wonder how much Bobby V. will take before he decides to put a beat down on Oral?  Hopefully, it won&#039;t it be during commerical break. But hey, its whatever you folks in N.E. want these days. ENJOY!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well you seem to be even more uninformed than you accused Joe Morgan of being. He is a genius when it comes to analyzing the game and knowing what is going on in the game. If you bothered to listen to what the man said about the &quot;Game&quot; you would come away a better fan and a better person.

He has, just this minute, forgotten more about the game than you will ever know. Gawd forbid someone ever be critical about mighty Bahston...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jor Morgan&#039;s career is comparable to Jeter&#039;s Gold Glove defense. Despite the fact that they suck, they have continued to be rewarded for it.

At least for Joe, his run has ended and we can all move on to better things.]]></description>
