		<description><![CDATA[I like the Pats as much as anyone, and I don&#039;t see how this is harsh. Broncos&#039; figures in the scandal have a connection to the Pats, and this scandal is reminiscent of what the Pats did.

The one thing I noticed is if Roger Goodell thinks the Broncos didn&#039;t do anything wrong in handling the situation once they became aware of it, then he literally fined them for nothing. Then he speaks of integrity. And the questionable handling of head hunting helmet hits.]]></description>
