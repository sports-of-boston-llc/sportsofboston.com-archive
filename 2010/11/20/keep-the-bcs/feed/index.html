		<description><![CDATA[Mr. Goisman’s praise of the BCS system in his article is not well thought out and ignores several factors in his arguments. I will first address your belief that no one has proposed a solution. There have been many different playoff structures suggested and the most popular has been a sixteen team playoff that includes all of the conference champions, including non-AQs, and five at-large bids. The games would be played at the home stadium of the better ranked team, therefore giving a great deal of importance to rankings, and the national championship would be played at a neutral site. You seem to believe that this would ruin the dramatic regular season, but this is completely wrong. There would be a 120 teams vying for a sixteen spots, and the including of non-AQ conference champions would make the seasons of those teams actually possess substance. You wrote of players being benched in final games, but why would Oregon bench James against Oregon State? Why would Auburn sit Cam Newton for the SEC championship game? And finally you spoke of how big name companies are what fill the seats in bowl games. But in the purposed playoff teams would be playing at their home stadiums, a guaranteed sell-out no matter who their playing. It would be much better to watch games in a packed stadium of devoted fans, as opposed to the ones half-filled with mildly interested fans because people did not want to travel hundreds of miles to a neutral location.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually, I think the bowl system is great.  In fact, we should just eliminate all that playing nonsense, and just stick to voting for who the best teams are.  
I say if its good enough for american Idle (sic) and Dancing with the Starz its good enough for college football.]]></description>
