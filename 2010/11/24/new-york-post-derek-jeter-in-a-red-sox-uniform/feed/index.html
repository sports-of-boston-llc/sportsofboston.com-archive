		<description><![CDATA[Nick, you obviously live in Boston with this kind of foolish thinking. Why should the Yankees pay Jeter &quot;what he wants&quot; after he just finished one of the most lucrative contracts in baseball history? The Yankees paid him $189 MILLION over the last 10 years. That&#039;s LOTTERY money and you just want them to hand over another $100 million like it&#039;s nothing? Tell you what, how about the Red Sux match whatever offer Jeter gets and give it to Vartek? He&#039;s been a loyal player and the face of the franchise, though he&#039;s not classy like Jeter. But pay HIM what he&#039;s worth. 
The fact is, the three-year, $45 milion offer from the Yankees is MORE than Jeter is worth at this point. It&#039;s a generous offer. But Jeter wats A-Rod money, which is insane. It&#039;s also insane that Jeter wants a raise at 37 after the worst season of his career. Jeter is off-base on this one. No team is going to come close to the Yankees offer, so why should they add on another $20 million or more? Jeter has already made about $200 million in salary from the Yankees. Him being in Pinstripes adds endorsement money in the millions. So why screw that up? If he wanted another big-money deal, he should have signed for less than 10 years on hs last contract, rather than letting it expire at an age where he likely would be in decline. 
So, let me know when you want to offer Varitek $15 million a year and then we can talk about Jeter&#039;s deal. Until then, let&#039;s talk about Beckett&#039;s extension. How do you like them apples?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Yankees really baffle me sometimes. They&#039;re willing to throw any amount of money at any player, sometimes one who has barely proven himself. They have the highest team salary in baseball, and they&#039;re comfortable with it, yet they won&#039;t pay the face of their franchise for the past 15 years what he wants. I respect Jeter as much as I hate the Yankees, so I hope someone pays him what he&#039;s worth. I know what he&#039;s asking for is a little high....but come on, it&#039;s the Yankees. When was that ever a problem, especially for a loyal player? Glad to live in Boston.]]></description>
