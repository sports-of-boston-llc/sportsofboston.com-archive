		<description><![CDATA[Why was he suspended in the first place? 

Because it was established by the NCAA that his father was soliciting $ from Mississippi State.

Question:Is Newton and Auburn now not subject to NCAA Rules as they are written? If so, why? This is really confusing because the rule says that a players parent cannot solicite $ from a school without being in violation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First off Reggie Bush did not go to the University of South Carolina.
The NCAA has said Newton is eligible because neither he nor Auburn knew of his fathers request for payment.  Isnt this great news for every major college in America?!  Now the NCAA has said that booster and players parents can make back room money deals and as long as they dont tell the player or the school it is ok!  Let the bidding wars begin!]]></description>
