		<description><![CDATA[I agree with every point you made, KC.  Rondo is essential and so is Pierce, and without complete health for the rest of the team, they have no chance.

By the way, can you think of another center besides Perkins who is completely unable to even think about hitting a jumper from as close to the basket as 12 feet?  I wince every time I see him turn down those short jumpers and peer around like a lost lamb looking for someone to pass it to. Yes, he&#039;s effective around the basket, but he presents absolutely no threat offensively anywhere else.  To me, he&#039;s little more than a lumbering dinosaur who can play some defense, but is no scoring threat and isn&#039;t even proficient at setting picks without fouling.  What do you think?]]></description>
