		<description><![CDATA[The rings are impressive, but that is a team effort and not what I take into consideration for all time greats. Peyton has four MVP&#039;s, which no one else in the history of football has. Tom Brady has thrown over 4,000 yards three times. Manning has over 4,000 yards in 10 of the last 11 seasons. Brady has gotten better since the addition of Moss. Manning has gotten better since the departure of Marvin Harrison. Both Moss and Harrison are Hall of Fame players. Brady has over 95 passer average in his past two full seasons. Manning has over 95 in seven straight seasons. Brady is in the top five greatest QB&#039;s of all time, but saying he is as good as Manning shouldn&#039;t be a debate. If Super Bowl rings are the main argument against me, then I would say that Terry Bradshaw is better then Brady because he has four rings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yea... ok,
You can make that argument that Peyton manning is the best, and I could even support it, but you can&#039;t make him seem that much better than Brady or Marino, because he really isn&#039;t. Peyton Manning only has 1 ring (soon 2) Tom Brady has 3, Tom Brady has 50 touchdowns in a season, something Peyton Manning only has 49 in. The points are that although Peyton Manning is way more consistent than Tom Brady, he is definitely not too far Peyton Manning on the list of &quot;The Greats&quot;.]]></description>
