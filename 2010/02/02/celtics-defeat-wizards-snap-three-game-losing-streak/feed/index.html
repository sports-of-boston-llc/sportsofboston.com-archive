		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t quite tell if you&#039;re being sarcastic or not. Scal played 10 minutes and put up 0 points. He was the only player with a negative +/- rating. We could probably find a team dumb enough to take him, but we wouldn&#039;t get much in return.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Matt - everybody loves an optimist, but this &quot;February Celtic&quot; stuff is more in the line of a fantasy.  The Celts were behind the Wizards for almost the entire game.  The Wizards are one of the worst teams in the NBA, and until the final quarter, they dominated Boston.  Ray Allen spent most of the first half shooting bricks, Perkins couldn&#039;t score, House was of no use,and without Pierce and Rondo the Celts could easily have been behind by 20.  Against the Wizards?  Get real.

By the way, you forgot to mention the incredible contribution of Scalabrine, who played some fairly significant minutes while Walker got to sit on the bench once again.  Surely, there should be rumors involving the imminent trade of Scal.  I can&#039;t imagine any team in the NBA that wouldn&#039;t jump at the opportunity to place him on their roster. Just look at his stats for the year to see how valuable a commodity he is.  As Doc and Heinsohn are always eager to point out, Scal does those little things that help make the Celts tick.  And they sure have been ticking lately.  Kind of like a time bomb ready to implode.]]></description>
