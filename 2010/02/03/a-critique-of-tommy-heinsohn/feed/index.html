		<description><![CDATA[Tommy Heinsohn is someone I do not enjoy listening to. I watch a lot of NBA games and compared to the other commentators it is annoying how much he is rooting for the Celtics and disrespecting the visiting team with his comments. Even if he is wrong and the replay is showing it, he would still whine about it. I hit the mute button often so I can enjoy watching Pierce and Rondo play and battle other good teams. Tommy is probably a great commentator in the eyes of a hardcore Celtics fan, but for me being neutral to the Celts but loving NBA it is hard to digest his Celtics-centered presentations.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tommy I&#039;m crazy about you. Keep telling it like it is! Does the author of this article really pay attention to your commentating? Does he know you were a player,  a coach for championship teams, and you have green blood running through your veins? You would not have so much to say if the officials called the game better. The fans need to focus because we do get some off-calls. I hope you keep up with the b-ball rules because I am upset with the KG suspension. Why didn&#039;t the officials clear the area and take the ball out in another place? Why is KG the only one being suspended and fined? Where do I find b-ball rules for this type of call? Players should be more professional in their comments to the media about each other because poor sportsmanship really comes out. This is playoff time and the officials need to take their experience up a notch! Recognizing the officials are qualified (???)and it&#039;s tough job sometimes;they have to maintain their neutrality, and be consistent in their calls on both ends of the court in all games.]]></description>
