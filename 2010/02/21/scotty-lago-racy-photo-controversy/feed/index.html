		<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s ridiculous how the media and public in general come down on Scotty Lago and Tiger Woods for doing something questionable (if that) and wrong, respectively, but completely legal, while Donte Stallworth kills someone and the public - or the judge in that case - doesn&#039;t seem to care a bit.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Somewhere in a controversy of this -- or in any -- lies a question, or so it would seem to me.  That being, what exactly is the nature of the so-called crime, which in this case sent sent Scott Lago back home. Clearly it was the &quot;appearance&quot;on the part of the &quot;perceiver&quot; of what was happening.  With that in mind, arguably the perceivers should have been asked to go home. As an old mentor of mine used to say, &quot;a lie believed in is truth in effect.&quot; That&#039;s the &quot;truth&quot; that was in the head of those making this decision. Who knows what Lago was thinking.  I don&#039;t, do you?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So what if he&#039;s doing something like that? Nothing illegal went on. Nobody else was harmed. And if I had a girl that hot hanging onto me, I would&#039;ve done much worse.

To here the media say it, you would think nobody is ever allowed to have any fun at any time, even behind closed doors.]]></description>
