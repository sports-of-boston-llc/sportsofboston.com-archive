		<description><![CDATA[Yeah that probably would&#039;ve been a good idea, Ken, haha.

Let&#039;s see if they can take a fourth straight out West against the Nuggets today! That would be a huge win coming back home.

Yeah, all I have to say about Scal is that he has a $4 million expiring contract, so enjoy the show while it lasts.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[K.C. - You just have to use your handy dandy recorder (VHS, DVR, Tivo) and get some sleep.  Then you can watch the game in the morning and buzz through all those annoying commercials.  I consider my DVR to be the greatest thing since sliced bread.  It makes watching golf (5 minute commercials every 10 minutes), boxing (one minute commercials every 3 minutes), and every other sport so much more pleasant. Go for it!

Nice to see the old boys playing so hard.  Who would have predicted 3 straight on the west coast?  Let&#039;s have an all star break every couple of weeks.

By the way, how could you fail to mention the amazing in bound pass from my favorite NBA star, Brian Scalabrine?  Yes, he&#039;s truly a master at all the &quot;little things&quot; that don&#039;t appear in the stat sheet.  He should have been credited with 2 points for Portland on that play.]]></description>
