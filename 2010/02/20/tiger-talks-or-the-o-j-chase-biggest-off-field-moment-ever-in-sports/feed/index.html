		<description><![CDATA[I think the OJ thing was bigger...because it was so unexpected and out of nowhere. I mean, I was watching &quot;Hanging with Mr. Cooper&quot; when OJ interrupted the show by driving that infamous white Ford Bronco. Everyone (who was alive) remembers where they were when they heard about JFK&#039;s assassination, everyone remembers where they were when 9/11 happened...and I would bet everyone remembers where they were when they watched OJ&#039;s police chase.

Tiger&#039;s talking was planned, so we knew it was coming, so it wasn&#039;t bigger than OJ (but still a BIG story).]]></description>
