		<description><![CDATA[The way this team looks right now, they won&#039;t make it out of the first round of the playoffs.  A title this year is clearly just a pipe dream.  All a team has to do to beat them is show up for the second half.  Old bodies, injured bodies, lack of chemistry, lack of defense, pathetic shooting from the free throw line, and a team that has seemingly lost its will to win - thet&#039;s the Celtics of today.

KC is absolutely right when he says that this sort of play is forcing Ainge to do something - or at least it ought to.  As much as I like Ray Allen, I think he has to go for a younger player, and it&#039;s pretty clear that Garnett should just not be playing at all.  Pierce should definitely forego the All Star game, even if it&#039;s a non contact event, and I fear he&#039;s going to embarass himself again in the 3 point contest if he participates.

About the only bright spot last night was the play of Marquis Daniels, who just seems to glide out there.  And why is Rasheed so dumb that he can&#039;t see how much better he is inside than outside? I&#039;d be more than happy to trade him for a young body as well - if anybody is stupid enough to pick him up. He&#039;s just the type of person who does what he damn well pleases, no matter what anybody says. Nobody coaches Rasheed.

And please, Danny, whatever you do, be sure to throw Scalabrine into any deal you make.  Enough is really enough.]]></description>
