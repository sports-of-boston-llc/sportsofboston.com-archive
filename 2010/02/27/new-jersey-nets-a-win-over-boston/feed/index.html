		<description><![CDATA[I bet Nate Robinson thought he&#039;d died and gone to heaven when the Knicks traded him to Boston.  I wonder what he&#039;s thinking now.

Is there anybody out there (besides Net fans) who wouldn&#039;t trade Perkins for Lopez?  Or Robinson for Lee?  Or this package deal - Perkins, Robinson, Tony Allen, Shelden Williams (who Doc evidently hates), and Scalabrine(who Doc evidently loves) for Lopez, Lee and Harris. Okay, I&#039;d probably throw in Daniels if they insisted.  Mainly because he&#039;s so injury prone.  New Jersey would be crazy to take the deal, but aren&#039;t they the worst team in the league, and one of the worst in NBA history?  Isn&#039;t it sad to want 3 starters from such a team?  I guess that&#039;s just a measure of how low the Celts have gone.]]></description>
