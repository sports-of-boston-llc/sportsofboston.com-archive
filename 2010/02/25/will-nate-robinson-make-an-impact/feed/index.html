		<description><![CDATA[Time will tell about Robinson&#039;s value, but first impressions haven&#039;t been terrific.  I&#039;m most bothered by the fact that Walker and Giddens were sent along with House.  Doc Rivers is a terrible coach to have when you&#039;re young and need playing time.  He never gave either of those two a real chance to show what they could do.  It&#039;s probably a lucky break for them that they were traded, but I cringe when I think of their youth and athleticism and realize that the future of the Celts is in the hands of a core of players who are getting older and more injury prone every year.  Yup, time will tell.]]></description>
