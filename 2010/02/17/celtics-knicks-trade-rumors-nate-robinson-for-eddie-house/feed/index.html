		<description><![CDATA[Well, I&#039;d be happy to make the deal, but it doesn&#039;t solve any major problems for the Celts.  House played hard, occasionally rose to the occasion as a 3 point star, and had a winning spirit.  Robinson seems much the same, only a little better on a regular basis.
He&#039;s about the same height as House, and has the same defensive frailties.

The trade still doesn&#039;t address the problem of an ageing and often injured Celtic &quot;big three&quot;.  And perhaps most important, it keeps Brian Scalabrine on the roster.  Won&#039;t the Knicks throw in a ball boy or two if we give them Scal?  That would really sweeten the deal.]]></description>
