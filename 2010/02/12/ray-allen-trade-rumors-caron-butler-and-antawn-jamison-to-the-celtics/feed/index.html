		<description><![CDATA[Geoff, you&#039;ve got a serious case of wishful thinking,I&#039;m afraid.  Like you, I&#039;d take this trade in a minute, but I can&#039;t imagine the Wizards going for it.  How do you rebuild with a 34 year old shooting guard?  And why would any team in its right mind want Scalabrine?  I can understand that they&#039;d give Giddens a shot - which is more than Doc (let&#039;s play the old guys til they drop) Rivers ever did, but I bet they&#039;d want Walker too - and I wouldn&#039;t blame them.  

Nah, this fits in the &quot;too good to be true&quot; category.  I can only hope there&#039;s truth to this rumor.]]></description>
