		<description><![CDATA[Ahmed F., Canada was the favorite in the tournament at even money, Russia was second at 2-1 odds: http://www.vegassports-odds.com/201002112065/2010-winter-olympics/headlines/mens-ice-hockey-odds-canada-favored-in-2010-vancouver-olympics
And I wrote that the US had outplayed Canada in the tournament previous to yesterday&#039;s game, which in my opinion they had, since they won head-to-head, won the group they shared, and thrashed Finland, while Canada only beat Slovakia by one goal. As for hot goalies, that&#039;s part of a team&#039;s play, it counts. 

I assure you that all patronizing of Canada was done in good fun and attempted humor.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Beyond the patronizing view on Canadians, the favorites were actually Russia, not Canada.

Furthermore the US did not outplay the Canadians in the round-robin game - pretty much every analyst said so. They rode a hot goalie and got past them there.

Still a bloody awesome game worthy of the Olympics Gold Medal game.]]></description>
