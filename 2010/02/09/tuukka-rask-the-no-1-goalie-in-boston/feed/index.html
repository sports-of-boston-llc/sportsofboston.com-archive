		<description><![CDATA[Well, I think we&#039;ve gotten to the point where we can rely on Tuukka Rask as not only the best goalie on the Bruins, but one of the best goalies in the entire league. Look at his save percentage, then look at Thomas&#039;. Look at his GAA, then look at Thomas&#039;. Add all this up and then look at who a. has the better reflexes and b. has the better goaltending foundation, and there really is only one logical conclusion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[People are a bit too enamored with Rask right now, I think. He&#039;s honestly the most egotistical non-enforcer hockey player I&#039;ve seen. If you listen to his post-game interviews on the radio all he does is talk about himself and I&#039;ve even heard him make snide comments about his teammates and smug ones about Thomas. He&#039;s JUST starting to acknowledge the other players and that&#039;s probably because Julien&#039;s been bagging on his puck handling some lately. Is he a technically good goalie? Oh yes, and I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll get better. But Thomas is the one who&#039;s never put me to sleep.

No seriously, I&#039;ve fallen asleep during about half the games Rask has been in. Most boring, uncreative goalie I&#039;ve seen. And it&#039;s not a built-in part of being a calm goaltender either, cuz Marc Andre-Fleury is a thinker/planner too and he&#039;s still fun to watch. I don&#039;t know if this kid needs to come into his own and get over a youthful ego or what, but as it stands I can barely stand paying attention to Bruins games right now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Look for Tuukka Rask to get his fifth consecutive start on Thursday.

Rask is 2-0-2 in his last four starts, giving up only six goals in 137 shots as opposing teams have been peppering the Bruins netminder. Rask seems to have taken over the number one spot in Boston and Tim Thomas owners can only wait and hope he gets another chance in goal.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d just like to say that as the author of this article, that I don&#039;t write Tim Thomas off at all and if that is what you feel then I&#039;m sorry. Thomas is a great goalie but I think that he&#039;s a better goalie when people doubt him. 

Ever since he came into the league everyone envisioned him as a backup. He was the backup to Raycroft at one point and then to Hannu Toivonen when Raycroft was traded. Even when Manny Fernandez was brought in 2007 many people thought that Thomas would be the backup once again, but due to injuries to Fernandez Thomas took over the starting role and played extremely well. 

When you look at Thomas&#039; stats this season, or even go back and look at tapes of the games, he has been very inconsistent all season. I&#039;m not saying that it was the past two weeks, it&#039;s been all season. Thomas has had three seperate 4-game lossing streaks thus far this season. 

What made Thomas a good goalie the past couple of seasons was that he had a viable backup that gave him time off when he needed it. Fernandez was perfect for that. Even when Fernandez went down with an injury in 2007 the Bruins had a decent goalie in Alex Auld. 

Just by chance that Rask gets more starts than Thomas down the stretch, is that really a bad thing? Thomas has already started 35 games this season and should get some much needed rest. Rask is younger and &quot;should&quot; have more energy to play more often. 

Off the record, I like Thomas. He is a good strong goalie and if we were to make it to the playoffs than he is the person I would want to start in goal. It&#039;s just that if he keeps playing inconsistent than maybe him and Rask would need to alternate games, which wouldn&#039;t play well with either player I can assume. 

Thomas IS the No.1 goalie for the Bruins right now, but is it too early to say Rask might be in the future? Possibly, but I&#039;m sure the Bruins organization hopes he is and as a Bruins fan I hope he is as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Rask, on the other hand, is seven years younger and is a far more promising prospect than Raycroft ever was.&quot;

Why do so many amateur &quot;sports experts&quot; hate Thomas so much?  I&#039;ll never understand it.  You guys never give him his due.  It&#039;s completely irrational.  Thomas has proven to be able to win the big games and not give up goals at bad times.  That&#039;s huge.  But he has a poor stretch of about two weeks--as all goaltender do-and you are ready to throw him under the bus?  I&#039;ll bet you are just looking at the stats rather than watching every game.  The stats lie in this case.  Thomas had to endure far more games where the team in front failed to show up to play.  Rask lost too in these cases, he just didn&#039;t have to face it as often.

I&#039;ll tell you this much: the Thomas doubters like you would be all over Timmy for letting in all these goals from past the faceoff dot.  But instead you put on your Rask colored glasses.  Yet I&#039;ll bet you&#039;d dump Rask in a minute for yet another &quot;promising prospect.&quot;  You win cups with the players you have, not the prospects!

The fact is that Rask may one day be as good as Timmy, but it would be crazy to bank on it.  Without  great goaltending this team has no chance of winning a cup.  But you&#039;d dump him anyway for an unproven prospect who has yet to play a full schedule and has made several shaky starts?  That&#039;s irrational.

As for Raycroft not being as promising, this is true only in retrospect.  Those of us who weren&#039;t in diapers at the time know that Raycroft was considered just as promising as Rask.  He even won rookie of the year in his first season.  But he fell apart.  It&#039;s idiotic to compare him to Rask now because two good games doesn&#039;t make it clear if Rask will fulfill his promise or not.]]></description>
