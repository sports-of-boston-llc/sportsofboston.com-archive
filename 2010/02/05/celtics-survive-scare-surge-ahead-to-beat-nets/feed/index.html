		<description><![CDATA[Ken: sure was a crazy night in the NBA!

I think KG can still be effective for this team with his jumpers. That play at the end of the game when Rondo penetrated, drew the triple team, and dished back to KG...that was awesome. I think that can continue to be effective for them.

Yeah I don&#039;t quite understand Doc&#039;s thinking with the Shelden Williams situation...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There must have been something in the air last night all around the country: the Wizards beat Orlando, Minnesota beat the Mavericks, and the Celts came damned close to losing to the worst team in the NBA.  Ouch!

A few noteworthy points - Glen Davis actually began to look like a semblance of last year&#039;s Davis, the bench played far better defense than the starters, Walker got to play more than 47 seconds, Garnett is clearly not the same player he once was (but thankfully he can still hit his jumpers), and Paul Pierce manages to show up on the bench when he&#039;s injured as opposed to Kevin Garnett, who juat can&#039;t be bothered to put in an appearance when he&#039;s not playing.

As for Shelden Williams, your guess is as good as mine.  Ask Doc - I can&#039;t wait to hear why he favors Scalabrine over Williams.]]></description>
