		<description><![CDATA[Well the news is already breaking that Browns plan on releasing Stallworth, the only question now is whether or not Belichick tries to sign him. I think the Pats could get him for cheap and he&#039;s gotta want to prove his worth in the NFL so it might be a good move. 

Edelman did have a good season but was hampered by injuries, so he probably would&#039;ve had a better year than Stallworth did in 2007 but they are two different players. Like everyone else in the world has said, he is a Welker clone and that&#039;s exactly it. Imagine the Pats lining up Moss and Stallworth on the outside with Edelman and Welker in the slots, now that would be lethal. 

No one in the entire NFL is better in the slot than Welker and Edelman is quickly becoming a similar player. Moss and Stallworth have the speed/hands to really do some damage. 

Now it&#039;s up to Belichick to determine if it&#039;s a good move, but I&#039;m sure that if he&#039;s even considering it he&#039;s thinking of low-balling Stallworth to get him as cheap as possible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can you really see Bill Belichick making any trade that could possibly help Eric Mangini?

I could see them going after Stallworth if the Browns release him, but not otherwise.

Also, at the rate Edelman was improving, yes, he likely would have had a better season than Stallworth if he had played all 16 games.]]></description>
