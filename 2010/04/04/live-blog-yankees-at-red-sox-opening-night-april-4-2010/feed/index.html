		<description><![CDATA[haha I totally have that T-Shirt: Jesus Hates the Yankees.

Great game though! Good stuff!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[yankees should have had Neil Diamond pitch and sent Park out to sing.

Have you seen two better teams ever have such bad catchers? Martinez looked like a Little League rookie on the double steal and Posada should go over the signs with the pitcher and then consider catching the ball (hence the name &quot;catcher.&quot;)]]></description>
