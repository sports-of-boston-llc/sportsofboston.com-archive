		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think Big Ben is going anywhere. It seems strange they&#039;d really be that keen on &quot;dumping&quot; the best quarterback they&#039;ve had in over 40 years. For every Roethlisberger there are 4 Sam Bradford&#039;s who don&#039;t live up to expectations ie. Tim Couch, Brady Quinn, Jemarcus Russell, Ryan Leaf,  ect. ect. These guys don&#039;t grow on trees.

I&#039;m of the opinion that the Steelers entertaining a possible trade for him was to slap his ego around a little bit and show him they&#039;re serious about the whole situation.

We&#039;ll see tomorrow...]]></description>
