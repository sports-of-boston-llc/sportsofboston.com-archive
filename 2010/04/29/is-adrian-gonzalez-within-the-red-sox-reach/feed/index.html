		<description><![CDATA[True, both good points. The Red Sox Front Office has been well-known for over-valuing their own prospects, in some people&#039;s eyes. I think if the price were right they would have no problem giving him up, but the value they place on Kelly may be significantly higher than other teams. This could cause potential problems in any deal, but they have shown they are willing to give up significant prospects when the value they are receiving is at least equal in their eyes (ie, Justin Masterson last year).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree that Boston is not the only suitor for Gonzalez, but they are one of the most likely. The fact that the Red Sox have one of the deepest, if not the deepest, and best farm systems gives them a better shot to land him than others. Especially since many of the teams with stronger farm systems are not buyers in the trade market. Additionally, the fact that Hoyer and Epstein have a personal relationship may make negotiations smoother. 

As far as Ellsbury and Buchholz being included in a deal, I think your assessment is off here. As I said in this article, Hoyer is unlikely to want either of them.  They will be nearing free agency by the time the Padres are hoping to contend, and be making significant money through arbitration. Ellsbury is represented by Boras, and will surely be looking for a big payday. There is no question that the Red Sox have the prospects to pull off this deal without either of them being involved. When compared to deals like Atlanta&#039;s for Mark Teixeira, the Red Sox have enough prospects to do a very similar deal twice over and still not be completely void of viable prospects.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are full of it if you think the Pads deal Adrian and don&#039;t get either one of Ellsbury or Buchholz in return. Just because Hoyer came from Boston doesn&#039;t mean it makes them the only potential suitor for Adrian.]]></description>
