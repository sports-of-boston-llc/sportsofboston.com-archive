		<description><![CDATA[Stokes&#039; article is a travesty. There is no doubt that both clubs have supporters that are less than savory. However, to suggest it is only Rangers&#039; support and not  Celtic&#039;s fans that have engaged in thuggish behavior is beyond ridiculous.

I wonder if Mr. Stokes watched the match where Celtic supporters made plane flying gestures toward Claudio Reyna, an American midfielder for Rangers, right after 9/11. The list of thuggish behavior on the part of Celtic&#039;s fans is endless. 

This kind of one sided journalism is so typical of the media these days. No wonder the papers are dying. Good riddance, I say.]]></description>
