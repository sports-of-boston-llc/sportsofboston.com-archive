		<description><![CDATA[Good catch-- this article from April 1st doesn&#039;t even sound serious! Maybe the article should have had some sort of disclaimer at the end explaining that it wasn&#039;t true, so that humor-impaired people wouldn&#039;t be tricked by this article that appeared on April Fool&#039;s Day. Oh wait it does have one. 

Maybe the Red Sox will &quot;win for once this year&quot; if only the people of Boston would &quot;come together and encourage them&quot;-- maybe by buying every single ticket to every single game for years and years?

The Yankee fans I know can take a joke, so I&#039;m not really worried about their reactions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am a devout and die hard redsox fan, but this article really summarizes the redsox.  We are immature, and always hide the facts. Who won the world series last year? Who is in the lead of the AL East by 7 games.  The Yankees, who are a much better team than the Bosox.  Instead of posting immature and false articles, we, the people of Boston, should come together and encourage our team to win for once this year.  That would give us a reason to make fun of the Yankees.

I only speak the truth.]]></description>
