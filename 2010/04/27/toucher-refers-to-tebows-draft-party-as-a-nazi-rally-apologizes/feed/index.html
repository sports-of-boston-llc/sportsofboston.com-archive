		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a shame that you can&#039;t make a joke without offending someone.   His joke was funny and I wish he didn&#039;t have to apologize.  Some of us love edgy humor.  I don’t like reality TV so I don’t watch.  If you don’t like edgy humor don’t listen.  We all have a choice…don’t take mine away.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why is it &quot;obvious&quot; that Fred&#039;s comment would offend anyone? Lighten up pal. The station confirmed that no one called after he made the statement. This just got picked up by channel 7 on a slow news day. From what I&#039;ve read, the people who are offended and calling for his job are hearing things second and third hand. People need to relax.

Did you not look at what was going on at the Tebow house a little cross eyed? He&#039;s wearing the same shirt has 3 of his buddies, and his beard of a &quot;girlfriend&quot; is caressing some dudes arm. The whole scene was pretty weird. Fred was making a joke about it and came up short. But be honest, you joked about it with whoever you were watching the draft with.

And T&#038;R just &quot;still have a following&quot; on the new station. Seven months on The Sport Hub and they&#039;re third in their target demo. Seven spots ahead of D&#038;C. TARDS are the most loyal fans out there.

If there was money in radio they&#039;d be syndicated or on satellite. Boston is lucky to have Fred and Rich every morning.]]></description>
