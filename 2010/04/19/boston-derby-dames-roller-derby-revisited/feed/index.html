		<description><![CDATA[Excellent article Matt! Keep watching. As you say, having a fast and skilled jammer is essential, but as I watch the sport evolve, I notice that it is becoming more and more about pack control. Think about football: every team needs a fast and agile running back, but without an offensive line the running back is at the mercy of the defense. 

Played at its highest level, roller derby is as fine a sport as I have ever watched.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nicely done, I really appreciated your zone defense analogy. 

I find that the most successful jammers have a similar skill-set to that of an NFL running back: very rapid acceleration, an ability to see a path through the defenders, and footwork that produces quick lateral movement.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As above, thanks for putting this article together and giving your audience a view of Roller Derby through the eyes of a sports writer.

As a referee I can safely assure you that it&#039;s not only the skaters who take this game as seriously as any other sport. The rules and referees adhere keep the sport competitive, enjoyable, and most importantly of all safe.  You&#039;ll find the players, volunteers, and referees have all given hours, blood, sweat, tears, etc, to maintain operation on this crazed machine.

I also couldn&#039;t help but chuckle at the Nascar/Hockey comparison, as I&#039;ve previously used that exact phrase to describe it to a friend.

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks to all you lovely ladies for reading my article! I never knew it would be so popular! And I appreciate everyone fleshing out the game strategy for me. Had a blast! And to Lady Shatterly- of the two matches I attended, you were by far the best jammer I saw. I wanted to include a link to your derby dames bio, but I couldn&#039;t find one. Nor could I find any on some of the previous teams you played for. Sorry about that.

		<description><![CDATA[Keep the good vibes coming!   Thanks for the positive coverage.  For the teams that are just building (like mine) it&#039;s incredibly important for the press to legitimize the skills and reduce the stereotypes surrounding our beloved skates.
