		<description><![CDATA[If these two were in grammer school I might be able to smile at this; but as we all know this is the &quot;real world&quot; and they are both doing harm to the team just so they can keep their egos in place..
especially Robert Kraft. Does he really need Mankins to do this in public. I have lost a lot of respect for Kraft. What happened to &quot;TEAM FIRST&quot;...out the window I guess. Well at least we had the 1st decade of the new millenium..!!]]></description>
