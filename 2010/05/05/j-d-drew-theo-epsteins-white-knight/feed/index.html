		<description><![CDATA[Will Jacoby Ellsbury be back /  Smart money says no . They will trade him, as they seem to be VERY happy with The zipperhead that they have been trotting out there night after night . 
    They don&#039;t need two center fielders, and Jacoby has made it Crystal Clear that he wants toi play Center , or nothing  ( Which , by the way , he should be  ) . They will trade him away, the next Fred Lynn, defensively, and the next Rickey Hendersen on the base paths... 
    I see Jacoby in Baltimore , this time next year , as the Sox use him to steal whatever little pitching they have left ...
    It was nice, Jacoby , buy ask Jeremy , its not a good thing to be flattened by Beltre. a Record two careers ruined in one season, by a single player ? .... Looks to be ... 

  O.k. Bye, Drew.. I&#039;m all Dissappointed ; I thought Drew was gone at the end of this season ... Now, I have another Season of Ho - Hum in Right ... 
   Perhaos, i &#039;ll do the bass fishing ...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What a bunch of Crap..... Stats can be made to say anything, and the fact that Red Sox fans collectively KNBOW what they see , night after night, or don&#039;t see, if the Whiner is again hurt ... We KNOW Baseball, and the Brand of Baseball that J.D. Drew plays is Not the type of ball we signed on for; &quot; Techno Ball &quot; , the game of Stats that Theo plays , is not baseball....  Dwight Evens  ( who may , or may Not have been better than Drew ) Puts Drew to shame .  I hated the over rated Trot Nixon, but even he played baseball.... Drew gets a hit, then maybe walks , and that&#039;s it; he stands there the rest of the night, praying for a walk to increase his OBP.  He is the Greediest Player on the team, because he plays the game for himself, as a business, NOT as a game... 
   People faulted Manny for being silly, playing funny .. he had FUN .. Yes, He made a fortune doing it .  Drew reminds me of Dorn, The 2nd baseman in the movie &quot; major League &quot; .. he was all business, and the game was simply a way to get money . Not a Game . 
  Its hard to explain ... Look.. Jeter has it , A - rod does not.  Red Sox Shoprt stop Scotero has it, as does Pedoia .  Drew does not.  Adrian Beltre is Borderline.. He&#039;s Greedy to a fault, but plays hard , and hurt . 
     I simply cannot wait for Drew&#039;s contract to be over ; I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll retire, back to Hicksville, where he can fish for bass, and shoot all the white tails he wants. 
    Just don&#039;t come back to Fenway ... Ever.... 
   Leave your glove on the field when you go , as well as your bats .....]]></description>
