		<description><![CDATA[I really loved this article. Neagle provided some solid information about the Patriots. His background knowledge about the sport of football and the Patriots organization is extremely evident. My favorite part of Neagle&#039;s article was when he said, &quot;Instead of selecting a potentially dangerous locker-room presence, Belichick did what we all should have expected him to do, and traded for more draft picks to eventually balance out the whole team.&quot; I totally agree with this statement. Belichick is an extremely smart coach and always makes decisions that are going to benefit the team. Great article, can&#039;t wait to hear more from Colin Neagle.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like the article and I&#039;m a fan of the Devin McCourty pick.  I think the author had a good grasp of the Patriots draft strategy, and did a good job analyzing why the Pats selected who they did.  I was just a little confused by the picture of Darius Butler and not McCourty, but good stuff.  Excited to hear more from this writer.]]></description>
