I totally agree with you that the NFL HAD to lose this case, or else we would be buying 60 hats in the not to distant future.  However, given the way most teams operate in the NFL (I am looking at the Pats, Cowboys, and yes the Raiders), I would look for them to sign a exclusive deal with an apparel company on their own.  At which time the prices would still go up for most team&#039;s &quot;stuff&quot;.  More loot for the Krafts, for Jerry and old senile guy in Oakland.  I theory.. this is almost like the rich getting richer in that the better teams with resources will gain more.  (not that is you are horrificly run team you should just go away anyway... I am looking squarely at Jacksonville here)]]></description>
