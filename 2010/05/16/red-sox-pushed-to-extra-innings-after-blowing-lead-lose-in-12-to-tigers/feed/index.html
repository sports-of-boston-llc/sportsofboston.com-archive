		<description><![CDATA[The Red Sox just don&#039;t beleive in

sacrifice bunts.  This has happened

enough times that we end up loosing.

With men on first and second and no

body out in extra inning game.  Guess

what? YOU BUNT!!!!.  And we win that

game the Tigers who out managed

and out played us.

That&#039;s why we loose so many close games.  Your not a team your just worried about your individual stats.  Frustrated Red Sox Fan]]></description>
