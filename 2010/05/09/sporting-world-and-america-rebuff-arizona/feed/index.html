		<description><![CDATA[Sports do indeed have a significant impact on social issues just as this. The NFL stripped Arizona of a Super Bowl because of their defiance to honor Martin Luther King Day. Arizona subsequently recognized the holiday and was awarded a Super Bowl after that (and others since). The players, leagues, and most certainly the money have major ability to shape the policy. Should the MLB or NCAA move to pull their marquee sporting events, Arizona might reconsider once again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Absolutely. Aside from the Sheriff, we don&#039;t *technically* know whether the bill will go too far, but the potential for that to happen is too great, and too much to ignore.

There are much better ways to at least treat people like humans about it. Just not giving out any benefits like we do to citizens would go a long way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This bill is quite controversial for a reason. It&#039;s hard for me to have a true opinion as I&#039;m white and I don&#039;t look like I &quot;don&#039;t belong here.&quot; I understand people are concerned that it could be legal racial profiling. Maybe the bill is too far-reaching...

...but it would serve the U.S. better if illegal aliens left the country, and stopped taking our money without paying taxes. If they want to be a U.S. citizen, get in line! 

The LEGAL aliens did it the right way, and don&#039;t deserve to be clumped with the illegals as they might be in this bill...]]></description>
