		<description><![CDATA[My thoughts and prayers are with Dave Roberts,I&#039;m a big Red Sox fan and will never forget his steal to help win the World Series. At 19 my daughter was diganosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma,she is now in remission!She became a Red Sox fan while going thru chemo and we would watch Red Sox in 2 on NESN at the hospital. When she was well enough,we took her to her 1st game. We wish Dave the best! I know he can beat this like my daughter did. 

Sincerely,
Donna Sanders]]></description>
