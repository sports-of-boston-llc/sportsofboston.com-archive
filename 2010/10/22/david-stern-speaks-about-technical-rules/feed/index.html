		<description><![CDATA[If this ridiculous technical foul situation remains in place when the actual season begins, the game will be a farce.  Throwing Kevin Garnett out of that game in New York game is just one example.  I really don&#039;t know why the owners in the league don&#039;t get together and instruct every starting player on the team to go out there, argue every call, and get thrown out of the game, one by one.  Let it happen a few times, let the fans be heard about how much they enjoy watching a game without the starters, and Stern will have to back down and return the game to what it was before his idiotic edict took place.  Stern is an egomaniac who should be replaced.  Why in the world is he allowed such power?]]></description>
