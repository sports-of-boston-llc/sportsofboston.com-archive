		<description><![CDATA[i understand what you&#039;re getting at, but i can&#039;t agree.  first of all, i don&#039;t think you can have a series of sports documentaries like 30-for-30 without making one based on this series.  that being said, i don&#039;t know how else waksman could have made this.  as you said, we&#039;ve all heard this story a hundred times.  if it&#039;s been done before, there really isn&#039;t much else to talk about considering this story.

personally, i think waksman&#039;s work on this was perfect, because he set out to make a nostalgic piece about the biggest comeback in sports history.  he never claimed to have an analysis, or new development on it, rather a profile.  and as for creativity, i think the millar angle and the home video stuff captures it, as well as framing simmons and lenny clarke perfectly - as 2 fans reminiscing about the game the same way we still do.

but i hear what you&#039;re saying and i understand if you&#039;re not satisfied with it]]></description>
