		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a fair question. And I think if there was injury as common as concussions that was actually KILLING players, there would be serious discussion about fundamentally changing the game or discontinuing it. But because the NFL sweeps most of its former players under the rug, the cry for better concussion prevention isn&#039;t strong. The grand majority of fans don&#039;t understand the long-term effects of concussions, or they don&#039;t care, same as the league.
Given a big enough push by fans, football might change. But I don&#039;t think any injury that doesn&#039;t cost people their lives will ever become so concerning as to actually dissolve a billion dollar industry.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A good point, though if a player just misses out on insurance, they will have earned much more than enough to supply their own if needed.

And if concussions are that concerning, then why have football at all?]]></description>
