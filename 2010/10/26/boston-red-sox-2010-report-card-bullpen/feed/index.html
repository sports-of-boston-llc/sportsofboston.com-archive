		<description><![CDATA[Maybe the Report Cards I got in school were graded like this. 

Dan you’re getting a D because I expected better of you. Billy-Bob tho deserves an A! I never thought he’d even get half of them right.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dan,
I understand your point, but hear me out. Pap has to be graded by a different metric than Atchison. Papelbon is a known commodity in this league, a back-end, lights out closer. Grading on that curve, his grade fits. There&#039;s little room for error in the ninth inning.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott Atchinson is a full grade above Papelbon for 2011? I know Papelbon had a really bad year but his career needs to mean something.

Atchinson is 34 going on 35 while Papelbon is 29 going on 30.

Atchinson had a 4.66 FIP, a .277 BABIP (MLB average .302), and gave up a lot of homeruns (1.35 HR/9). He did have some bad luck other places but overall it appears he&#039;s exactly what he is... a long relief man.

Papelbon on the otherhand: 3.51 FIP, .307 BABIP, .94 HR/9 (MLB average .96). He had a 3.9 ERA but his peripherals say he should have been better.

Flip the grades, Papelbon B, and Atchinson C, and you&#039;re right.]]></description>
