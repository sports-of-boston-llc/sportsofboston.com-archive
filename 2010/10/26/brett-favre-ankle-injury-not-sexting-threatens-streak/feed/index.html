		<description><![CDATA[Congratulations to Favre for a long and productive career, and for hanging in there until he could go no further.  His injury is no joke, and eventually he and the Vikings will have to come to terms with the fact he can no longer play.

That story was never about anything more than the Jet&#039;s desire to create a distraction.]]></description>
