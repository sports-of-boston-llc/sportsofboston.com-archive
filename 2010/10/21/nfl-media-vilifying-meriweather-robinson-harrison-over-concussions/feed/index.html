		<description><![CDATA[&quot;This week’s fines were $50,000 to $75,000. That’s it? These guys have that in their couch cushions.&quot;

What? Meriweather is making 617,280 this year. Fining him 50,000 takes away about 8% of his salary. All for doing his job, a little too rough.

If Reilly who probably makes 50K a year made a dumb comment and was fined 8% of his salary ($4,000 dollars), OOoooo you know he would be fuming.

This has been SO overblown]]></description>
