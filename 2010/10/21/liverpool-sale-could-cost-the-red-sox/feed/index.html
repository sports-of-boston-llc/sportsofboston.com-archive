		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Liverpool is going to have the bulk of the attention from the leadership at NESV&quot;,...&quot;Let’s hope the Sox get some time in the off-season or else they might see a continuation of their dwindling numbers from last year.&quot;

Frankly, this is ridiculous. NESV didn&#039;t get where it is by micromanaging every issue in their organization. That would be VERY bad business.

Simply put, the Red Sox are now a self sufficient organization run by the people NESV put in place.

The few decisions that NESV will need to approve will not slow down the Red Sox. Carl Crawford will wait.]]></description>
