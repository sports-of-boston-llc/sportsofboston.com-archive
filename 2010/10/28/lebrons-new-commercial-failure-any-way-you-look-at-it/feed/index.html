		<description><![CDATA[I agree that the commercial was terrible and about 85 seconds too long. But I don&#039;t really see what it says about Lebron besides that he agreed to do the commercial. 

He didn&#039;t write it, athletes have no creative control over their ads. He was pitched the idea, maybe shown a storyboard and then him and his people agreed to do it.

As you say, the commercial&#039;s message is that he&#039;ll be whoever he wants to be and doesn&#039;t care what other people think (coughTRAITORcough) but to think that the ad was some sort of message from Lebron misses the point. Commercials are meant to sell products and create buzz. 

Posts like this help companies do that and in that sense, the commercial was a success. Weird, huh? By writing about an ad you hate, you&#039;re making it a better ad?]]></description>
