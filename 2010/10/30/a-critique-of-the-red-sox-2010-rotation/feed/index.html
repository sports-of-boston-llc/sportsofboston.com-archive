		<description><![CDATA[His ERA was terrible but nothing else being pointed out is terrible. His argument about which pitches worked and which didn&#039;t are a little off base, with no proof.

His numbers look more like a guy with a 4-4.5 ERA. His FIP (Fielder Independent Pitching) was 4.54 and his xFIP 4.01.

If you just look at his ERA he was bad. But that’s a ridiculously shortsighted way to look at your pitching staff.

He struck people out, he didn’t walk a lot of people, they got lucky on balls in play (BABIP).

I don’t see evidence that he was “atrociously bad” or that “any progress he made after his awful 2006 season seems to have been completely lost” OR that the Red Sox made an “unconscionable decision to extend him”.

It wasn’t a good season, but don’t blow it completely out of proportions like the sky is falling.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Feel free to include any sabermetrics you wish, I&#039;m always open to learn new ones and I&#039;d like a reason to have hope for Beckett in the future.  Also, thanks for pointing out how bad his fastball was. I was going to add a part about how his fastball isn&#039;t as effective when he can&#039;t throw his other pitches (like in 2006) but I had some trouble with wordpress and lost it. 

And me saying Beckett was &quot;not that good&quot; previously to now was a bit unfair because I hold him to the absurd standard he set in 2007, but no matter what the sabers say, he was terrible this year. Are you saying that his struggles were based off of things out of his control (BABIP)? Because then I understand what you mean.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Beckett 2009 through 2007 is that good. 

Becketts ERA did suck this year but his quality stats were not that bad this year. I won&#039;t use FIP or xFIP this time to to argue as I don&#039;t think anyone knows what it is.

Beckett still K&#039;d 8.18 K/9 (MLB avg 7.13), walked 3.17 BB/9 (MLB avg 3.28) and his BABIP was .349 (MLB average .302).

All in all a good pitcher. His BB/9 are the most alarming.= but this has been one of his most consistent skills and does not normally leave a pitcher so rapidly.

I hate to get into it all but if you want to point out an ineffective pitch, its Becketts fastball. Looking at his Pitch Effectiveness..

His fastball wasn&#039;t close to as effective as in normal years. The only other year it was innefective was 2006. Sounds significant.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah Beckett&#039;s just not that good even when he is healthy. We&#039;ll probably try to move Dice, which shouldnt be as hard as people think.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I honestly don&#039;t see Beckett fully recovering from this past season. is ERA was outrageous. Hopefully we won&#039;t have to worry about his health again, or he&#039;s really in trouble. Also, it might be time to finally get rid of Dice. Besides &#039;08, he&#039;s been nothing but a disappointment. It&#039;d be cool to see the Sox make a bid for Cliff Lee.]]></description>
