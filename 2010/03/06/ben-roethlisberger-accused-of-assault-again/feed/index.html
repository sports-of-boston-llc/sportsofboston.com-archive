		<description><![CDATA[Yes--No one knows what &quot;happened&quot; yet?  Unfortunately, for women..when you are alone with a man, without any witnesses, something &quot;bad&quot;, can happen, and then it just comes down to &quot;he said/she said&quot;.

I know that almost every single person from 18-35 does &quot;party&quot; a little bit.  Nothing wrong with that.

However, what is &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;dumb&quot;, or &quot;unfortunate&quot;, is that people think they can &quot;Hook Up&quot; with a &quot;Stranger&quot; (even a Professional Athelete) at a &quot;Club&quot;, and that...&quot;Something GOOD will happen&quot;.---NOTE to ALL---Meeting people is &quot;Fine&quot;, but...getting a number to talk later (when sober) is acceptable, but, going somewhere &quot;private&quot;, with a complete stranger is &quot;NOT&quot;.

I BLAME &quot;BEN&quot; because he is a pro-athelete who has to show some level of personal &quot;control&quot;.  He is going to have a lot of women &quot;throw&quot; themselves at him, because of the whole &quot;sports idol/rich single guy&quot; culture.  HOWEVER....he can say &quot;No&quot;, not now...if he is interested, and contact them later to date in a &quot;safe&quot; situation.  A CLUB is NOT a safe meeting place, and &quot;drunk&quot; is not &quot;consentual status&quot; to allow you to do anything to a girl you just met.

I am not &quot;blaming&quot; the girl.  Any girl who gets &quot;drunk&quot;, needs to be protected from &quot;unwanted&quot; advances, which can quickly lead to a &quot;sexual assualt&quot;....If the bodyguard, led her to a &quot;private area&quot;..&quot;DRUNK&quot;, and her friends saw that, the police should investigate him, for at least &quot;deliquency of a minor&quot; or &quot;providing sexual transport of a minor&quot;.---ALL WOMEN...need to try and understand,...DON&#039;T GET WASTED, without..a &quot;Protector&quot; who is &quot;NOT DRINKING&quot; and watching out for you. (There are losers everywhere.)

Have we already forgotten the tragic case of &quot;Natalie Holloway&quot; ?To just remind all women, that &quot;Cute&quot; guys...can be both, &quot;rapists&quot; and possibly &quot;killers.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1 - Big Ben was never charged with rape.
2- Just because somebody claims they were raped does not mean it actually occurred. (esp. if this alleged rapee has been dubbed a lunatic by people who know her)
3- We do know for certain that Tiger DID have multiple affairs. He ADMITTED this to the public.
4-How do you know there would be more media coverage if it were ochocinco TO or McNabb? You don&#039;t, because none of them were ever accused of raping somebody. Are you implying he&#039;s getting a pass because he&#039;s white? 
5-Ben was with TWO Pennsylvania police officers who both said they saw no foul play.
6- The &quot;rape #2&quot; victim as you called her, is a 20 year old college student who was drunk off her ass. She also just dropped out of school and hired a Civil suit lawyer. This just screams $$$$$$$$$$$.
7- Your spelling is atrocious. It&#039;s threw not through.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like how you through Tiger Woods name in the story as if to say....we can give Big Ben a pass because he&#039;s single. Great job, but you forgot to mention NOT ONE of Tiger Woods flings said he raped them. POW! Now explain why this rape # 2 is not getting the press it would if it was OCHOCINCO, or T.O, or Donavan Mcnabb?...............]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll also give Ben the benefit of the doubt. However, he really needs to stop putting himself in these kinds of situations. Apparently he does have body guards who follow him around. So you would think they&#039;d prevent something like this from happening AGAIN. 

Maybe it&#039;s time for him to try dating and give the hooking up with drunk college girls thing a permanent break. 

As a Steelers fan, I&#039;m used to no BS, so for this to happen again is frustrating. Pretty soon this stuff is going to catch up with him and start affecting his performance on the field too.

Also...the picture you have there doesn&#039;t look like it was recently taken. Big Ben&#039;s face looks fat. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if he weighs all of 265 right now. A sign he&#039;s been doing too much partying and not enough working out.

Anyway...fingers crossed.]]></description>
