		<description><![CDATA[You are soo stupid! I am friends of some of the Pats players and the ones that I have spoken to say that Ty is one of the best men in the locker room.  They also said that he wouldn&#039;t have seen the money because of taxes in MA.  That is something that people like us don&#039;t understand.  A guy like Ty is prob in the 60% tax bracket.  I wish you as a person knew what I know about some of these players.  You are so stupid for this!]]></description>
