		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment, always appreciate readers, even if they disagree with me. I would say first off that yes, I consider Billy Beane and Theo Epstein huge nerds. Not that that&#039;s so bad; I consider myself a huge nerd too, just not a fantasy nerd :)
I understand the counter-argument to fantasy sports, and I also get that perhaps fantasy leagues create new sports communities that are more passionate about players than, as you and Seinfeld call it, &quot;dirty laundary.&quot;
I didn&#039;t mean to begrudge anyone in my article, so if I offended anyone I apologize. I will agree that fantasy sports just aren&#039;t for me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First of all, you should try auctions rather than drafts. Maybe just as time consuming, but certainly calls for more active participation and is definitely more exciting.

I get your point about the nerdiness involved, but actually, fantasy sports are a pretty good way of gaining an appreciation of player value. I can tell you that I&#039;ve certainly learned a lot from fantasy sports about a player&#039;s value to his real-life ballclub, including signs a player is on the verge of a breakout. If fantasy competitors are nerds, well, so is Billy Beane and Theo Epstein, no?

True, there&#039;s a lot of math involved, but that&#039;s not terrible. Certainly our country might be better off if we were all a little more educated and competitive in how to take statistics and translate them into success.

Finally, speaking of competition, you&#039;re lucky enough to be in a community with a fervent local sports base. Rooting for the Red Sox seems natural. 

I honestly was growing a little wary of the money stuff in sports, taking away from appreciation of the game itself. As Seinfeld once said, aren&#039;t we really just rooting for a bunch of dirty laundry?   Players move from one team to the next. I grew up loving sports, but until I started playing fantasy sports, I found my interest in sports waning a bit. 

Here was an opportunity to be engaged in competition. You probably need to play in a more competitive league. Or maybe it&#039;s just not for you â€” which is fine, although don&#039;t begrudge those of us who find it enjoyable. 

Cheers.]]></description>
