		<description><![CDATA[I honestly haven&#039;t heard or read anything from anyone who has NOT considered this hit to be a blind-sided cheap shot.  And what happened is not &quot;simply part of the game,&quot; to me, that&#039;s ridiculous.  A hit to the head like that, Savard is lucky he escaped with just a concussion.  Hopefully we see him on the ice again this season...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Erikk, agreed! 

l smith -- How can you watch the video and still think it&#039;s a clean hit? He was blind-sided and injured in the back of the head. There&#039;s no place in any sport for head injuries.

Here&#039;s the video link for details: http://www.sportsofboston.com/2010/03/08/video-marc-savard-hit-by-matt-cooke-suffers-concussion/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[l smith, a &quot;brush&quot; won&#039;t knock a player unconscious. The hit&#039;s timing was questionable, at the very least, considering the fact that video shows Cooke had time to pull up, especially since he changed his skate path to hit Savard, who had slowed to take the shot. Furthermore, according to Rule 46.3 of the NHL Rulebook says a major penalty must be imposed for a foul resulting in an injury to the face or head of an opponent. 
I wouldn&#039;t really use the fact that no penalty was called to argue your point since the first two goals shouldn&#039;t have counted. Cooke should be suspended and most likely will be, knowing that he&#039;s already been suspended for questionable hits twice this season.
Hits are part of the game, but head injuries shouldn&#039;t be.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There was no elbow, it was a clean hit, more of a brush actually. Pretty sad that you classify this as a cheap shot other than just a hockey play. Pretty pathetic reporting, there was no penalty called and I will expect the NHL will take no action either.Clean hit, bad outcome. That would be how you report it.]]></description>
