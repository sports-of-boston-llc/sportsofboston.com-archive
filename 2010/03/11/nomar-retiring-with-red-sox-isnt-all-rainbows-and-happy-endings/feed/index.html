		<description><![CDATA[Nice piece, although in this lifetime its always good to show a little grace to those who have whole-heartedly done nice things for you. Even if it&#039;s only through a TV screen, autograph signing event or watching from the stands. These ballplayers were blessed with a gift and when they know, at the end of their run, where the people are who admire them most, they caome back as a sign of appreciation and we are here with open arms.  Mo Vaughn will be remembered, to me, in the same light.  Thank you Nomar for a wonderful career and years of rooting for a no doubt bonafide hustler and student of the game.]]></description>
