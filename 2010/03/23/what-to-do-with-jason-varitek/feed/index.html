		<description><![CDATA[Varitek was always a solid, dependable player. He wasn&#039;t just a good batter/catcher but an extremely valuable captain for the team. If he doesn&#039;t get it back, then my hope is that he gets a dignified retirement...I just dont know if I could ever come to grips with him playing for anyone else. Having said that, my dream is for him to make a comeback...I think hes still got some left for at least another couple seasons. Good luck Tek.]]></description>
