		<description><![CDATA[Chucky, what did Michael Finley ever do to you??

But seriously, I hear your frustration. This old team only got older, but I guess it can&#039;t hurt to have a veteran who has shown the ability to shoot during his career. He&#039;s won an NBA Title (like most of the Celtics roster of course), so he brings some championship experience. Also, he&#039;s sure to have a chip on his shoulder after being cast aside by the Spurs. We&#039;ll see if Finley can do anything for the C&#039;s...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t care who reads this or who thinks whatever I say is B.S. but i&#039;m a die hard Celtics fan and I just think  signing sorry ass Michael &quot;can&#039;t make a shot to save his mommas life&quot; Finley. was the dumbist move in the history in the franchise. I mean did anyone see him play in Dallas or San Antonio. The man don&#039;t even think HE can make a shot! His confidence is so damn low, he passes up wide open shots cause he know 9 times out of 10 he gone miss the sh*t. I mean he had one good year when Dallas lost to Miami in the finals. And everyone thinks he can shoot lights out from the 3 point line. bottom line he&#039;s sorry and he knows it and he weasled his way onto another squad. my squad. That speaks a lot about our GM. Finleys whole damn career is fluke. (YES IM PISSED OFF)]]></description>
