		<description><![CDATA[Every time I see Cleveland, I&#039;m less impressed.  I don&#039;t see them winning a championsip.  Of course, that doesn&#039;t change the fact that they - along with all the other decent teams - are easily better than the current crop of Celtics.  Sad to watch the boys in green these days, as they collapse in 3 out of every 4 games.  Unless they play Toronto in the first round of the playoffs, say goodbye to the season right then and there.  And right now, I&#039;m not even sure they can beat Toronto.]]></description>
