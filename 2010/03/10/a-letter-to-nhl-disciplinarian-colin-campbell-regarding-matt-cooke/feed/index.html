		<description><![CDATA[I am a die hard Boston Bruins fan as well, living in Vancouver B.C. 
   I grew up watching great players, Gordie Howe, Bobby Orr,  Darryl Sittler, The Mahovlich Bros., and I don&#039;t ever remember seeing the kind of cheap, cowardly moves that I have seen of late. 
   To be paid millions to play the game you love, is a dream come true for many. An honor for most. 
   So WHY, WHY would you disgrace and disrespect your fellow players with callous and cowardly moves like the one we saw on Sunday in Pittsburgh. One reason only- intent to injure.
   We have witnessed hits where the offending player later grins and jokes with his teammates on the bench, and I am disgusted. 
   I am also disgusted by the ineffectual way that Mr. Campbell rules, along with his equally culpable cohort Mr. Bettman.
   Shame on you gentlemen!!(and I use the term gentlemen very loosely.) You should hang your heads in shame for the handling of hits in the NHL.
   &quot;Fighting&quot; is never going to be removed from hockey, you shouldn&#039;t even try.
Cowardly, hit from behind moves, on the other hand, should.
   Can you give me a legitimate reason, and keep a straight face, other than intent to injure?
How many more great players need to endure career ending injuries before you will pull your heads out of the sand?
   I believe it is time for both of you to step down and allow fresh eyes to take over. 
   Perhaps the sheer number of videos you have watched over the last few years have dulled your ability to make a competent and fair decision in regards to punishment. 
 When did the rights of the guilty, take more precedence than those of the injured? 
   Do us, and the players a big favor and step down. Do the honorable thing. Or have you forgotten what that means?]]></description>
