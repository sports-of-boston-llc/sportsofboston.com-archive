		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s too bad that the Red Sox didn&#039;t give him a chance, or that he didn&#039;t even want to take one. I know we have no need for him on the field, but it would&#039;ve been nice to see him at least try. 

I think that he would be an incredible coach, whether it be in the minors or a bench coach, and I would like to see him in the Red Sox organization. Its nice that ESPN has already signed him on, but I would&#039;ve liked it much more if he joined the NESN team instead. 

Overall, just glad to see that he retired a Red Sox and even though he might not make it to the Hall of Fame, we will not forget what he did for the city and his on-going battles with A-Rod and Jeter all those years.]]></description>
