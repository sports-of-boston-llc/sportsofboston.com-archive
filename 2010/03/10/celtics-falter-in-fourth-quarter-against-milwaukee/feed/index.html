		<description><![CDATA[Pierce must still be injured.  He looks like he&#039;s going in slow motion and all his early season physical play seems like a faint memory now.

I&#039;m still wondering how anyone can take Perkins seriously as a &quot;force&quot; at center.  He played horribly, completely overwhelmed by Bogut, and late in the game he was walking up the court, head bowed, not even aware of the offensive play going on.  About all I&#039;ve come to expect from him is the inevitable late game foul or illegal pick that stops a rally.

I&#039;d be stunned if this team gets out of the first round of the playoffs.]]></description>
