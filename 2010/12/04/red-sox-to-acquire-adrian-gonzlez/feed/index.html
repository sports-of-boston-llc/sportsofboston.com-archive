		<description><![CDATA[Dan it&#039;s amazing that you had already projected Werth to make an absurd amount of money and the Nationals actually beat it by a year and 36 million... here&#039;s to not having 38 year old Jayson Werth for 126 mil!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is no way Gonzalez would be a good fit for the Cubs.
He is a totally classy guy, he isn&#039;t a whiner or a hot dog, and he puts forth 100% effort on every play.
Zambrano, Soriano, and Ramirez would find him offensive, both personally and professionally.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Because if the Sox sign Beltre, they won&#039;t be as able to sign one of the two outfielders. Beltre, Youkilis, Gonzalez, and Ortiz means someone would probably be left out, or shifted to an unfamiliar position.

And I was nervous about Beltre returning because too many of his errors were in key moments, which by Red Sox standards, isn&#039;t good enough. That may be good enough for Oakland, but the AL East is always the Group of Death in MLB.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@John... Werth could be as much as 5-6 yrs at over 90+ million and Crawford could be 7-8 yrs at over 120+ million.


Beltre&#039;s apparent high bid has been 5 years and 64 million from Oakland.


So I don&#039;t know where &quot;Beltre is worth way too much to keep&quot; is coming from.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I say Beltre is worth way too much to keep now that Youk and A-Gon are in the fold. Then again, I thought the same about Papi. Boston is much better off getting one of the two prized outfielders.

The question becomes do you want Crawford&#039;s speed and natural left fielder status, or do you want Werth&#039;s right-handed plate appearances?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Werth or Crawford is going to cost a fortune. Not sure its worth it.

Come next year Youkilis and Adrian will probably share 1B and DH duties anyway.

Or maybe they&#039;ll really like Youkilis at 3B and we&#039;ll be getting Prince Fielder at DH in 2012.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love the deal, and I love that Theo waited until he was comfortable enough to deal prospects (and the Sox get to keep both Buchholz and Bard).

As for Dan...Yeah, it&#039;s unlikely they use a gold-glove infielder like Youk in the outfield (though they have done it sparingly in the past). Werth has a cannon arm in the OF and is an on-base machine, so that would be a good fit. 

I&#039;d be OK with Werth or Crawford...but your hypotheis with Youk/Gonz/Beltre is interesting....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d still say Youkilis could play one year in LF. Not very likely but...

By next year Ortiz won&#039;t be on the Sox and Youkilis and Adrian can share DH/1B duties.

Beltre will probably be better and cheaper then either Werth or Crawford]]></description>
