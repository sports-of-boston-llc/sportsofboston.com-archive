		<description><![CDATA[While I agree to most of what you have to say above the question I have is where did the videos come from? If they were stolen from the Ryans&#039; private collection then I agree with you that it is a disgusting invasion of privacy. If however the Ryans posted it somewhere on the internet (which some people do for a little extra excitement) then it shows a lack of judgement and is open to public scrutiny.
Haven&#039;t read anywhere where the videos were obtained.]]></description>
