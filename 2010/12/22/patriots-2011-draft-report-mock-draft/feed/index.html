		<description><![CDATA[Do you really feel comfortable with BJE being the No. 1 back again next year? Sure, he&#039;s had a good season but the Pats need a back who can take 18-20 carries a game with Woodhead fitting  nicely in Kevin Faulk&#039;s role.

Brady won&#039;t last forever and are we that set with Hoyer as the No. 2? Belichck and Co. are not shy in picking developmental QBs. In 2008 remember when he picked Kevin O&#039;Connell in the third round?

You think OLB is a first round need? Personally I think we&#039;re in good shape with Ninkovich, Banta-Cain and 2010 rookie Jermaine Cunningham.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What are you drinking? The Pats are not taking a running back with their first rd pick and they are not taking a QB with their fourth rd pick...If they even draft a RB at all it will be in the fourth rd or later.......Thier first pick will be either a CB, DE or OLB depending on who is available.....]]></description>
