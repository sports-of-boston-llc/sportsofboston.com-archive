It&#039;s possible the Red Sox wanted to make a bigger splash than a Sunday afternoon and put e announcement on hold until the winter meetings. Depending on who the &quot;source&quot;is leaking the info, I wouldn&#039;t put it past them. Theo likes privacy on negotiations.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The A-Gon deal had better get done. Just make the extra two years automatic options based on performance. Or if he doesn&#039;t like that, just give him the two years. But that probably won&#039;t happen from the sound of things.

So A-Gon&#039;s gone, Werth&#039;s gone, V-Mart&#039;s gone, Beltre will probably be gone since the A&#039;s already offered something and the Sox haven&#039;t yet, and that just leaves Carl Crawford.

With Crawford (potentially) the only major offensive powerhouse left for Boston to sign, they really should get him on board and try again with Gonzalez next season, maybe clear some cap space for Gonzalez.

If Crawford doesn&#039;t sign, then that just leaves Cliff Lee as Boston&#039;s best chance to win, and the Sox aren&#039;t in the market for starters.]]></description>
