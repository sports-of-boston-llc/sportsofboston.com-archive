		<description><![CDATA[No, the lineup should be this:

1. Ellsbury CF
2. Pedroia 2B
3. Gonzalez 1B
4. Youkilis 3B
5. Crawford LF
6. Ortiz DH
7. Drew RF
8. Saltalamacchia C
9. Scutaro SS

Crawford and Big Papi can alternate 5 and 6 without anyone dying, same with A Gon and Youk. It would go left, right, left, right, left, left, left, switch, right.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t see Ellsbury or JD or Cameron being traded.

Right now the CF needs Ellsbury or Cameron. Both are not guarantees to produce this year and thats why you need a solid back-up. What better tandum can you get then Ellsbury and Cameron?

Ellsbury will be the CF starter and Cameron will fill in all OF positions (LF, CF, RF). Cameron also mashes lefties so when everyone is scared of being too lefty heavy, Cameron balances that out.

Besides Crawford no one in the outfield is a guarantee. Thats why the Sox need to keep at least 4 solid outfielders at all times. And I wouldn&#039;t consider Kalish that yet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, it is a lefty-heavy lineup, after all.

And with Ortiz batting 5th, opponents are more likely to walk Gonzalez/Youkilis to tackle Ortiz. Crawford&#039;s batting average/power/speed will be more of a deterrent and allow for three straight tough hitters to have a go.

Plus, a stolen base threat in the middle of the order instead of at the end provides balance to the lineup, instead of stacking them at #9/#1, and allowing other pitchers, especially relievers, to prepare, where it&#039;s harder to do that for speedsters in the front and middle.

Crawford has power and speed, just like Ian Kinsler, who the Rangers also like to put in spots in the middle of the lineup. Remember, Kinsler&#039;s production was limited by injuries in 2010.

You have to think outside the box in order to make it tougher on opponents and easier for yourself to win.

And Ellsbury has a good OBP when he&#039;s healthy but doesn&#039;t hit many hard balls, so I highly doubt the Red Sox, if they keep him, will take away an AB a game from him by dropping him to 9th.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[no chance in hell the lineup looks like that. you&#039;ve got a 40-50 sb guy batting 5th and 3 straight lefties who struggle against LHP from 5th through 7th.

it&#039;ll like likely look this:

ellsbury
pedroia
crawford
adrian
youkilis
ortiz
lowrie
drew
salty

and they might even drop jacoby to 9th as a second leadoff type which case the lineup will look like this:

pedroia
crawford
adrian
youkilis
ortiz
lowrie
drew
salty
ellsbury

and of course i think lowrie will get more AB than scutaro seeing as he almost slugged .500 last season.]]></description>
