		<description><![CDATA[The quotes are hilarious.

But you&#039;re wrong about Tate&#039;s reception in the endzone.  The rule is that two body parts other than the hands must touch in bounds before any part of the body touches out-of-bounds.  Tate got one foot down in bounds, then his forearm touched in bounds before his elbow touched out-of-bounds.  Foot plus forearm equals two body parts in bounds, and it was therefore a reception.  If &quot;Coach Ryan&quot; had challenged that, he would have lost. That might be the only thing he got right all night.]]></description>
