		<description><![CDATA[I bet Dave Duncan is able to turn Zink into a capable major league pitcher. He&#039;ll be in the NL and the pitching is too watered down, so he may fit right in, especially seeing there hasn&#039;t been a capable knuckleballer in the NL since...umm...Wakefield in the early 90&#039;s with the Pirates? Or maybe Steve Sparks?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry to see Charlie Zink go. Had a couple of good runs down in the minors...just never could put it together in the majors. It&#039;s funny, because he did dominate at times for both Portland and Pawtucket. I liked having two knuckleballers in the system...showed the team&#039;s commitment to the floater. Now what are they going to do, just dumb Wake too? Keep the knuckler alive in New England!]]></description>
