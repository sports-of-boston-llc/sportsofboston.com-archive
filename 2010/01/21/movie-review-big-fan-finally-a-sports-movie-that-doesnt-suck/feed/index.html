		<description><![CDATA[Totally agree. Every sports movie I&#039;ve seen has been complete crap. It&#039;s not even the fact that I don&#039;t like sports that much. It&#039;s the fact that they&#039;re all so damn predictable! Every...single...one. I&#039;m watching the Blind Side right now and I can already predict the ending without looking it up. Let&#039;s see, I predict that the guy will join a football team that sucks and his presence will make that football team win some kind of championship. Woohoo! And guess what? It&#039;s based on a true story! Like Remember the Titans! Except if you actually look up what really happened, you&#039;ll see that they grossly distorted history to fit their lame predictable perception of the movie. Drives me nuts every time!]]></description>
