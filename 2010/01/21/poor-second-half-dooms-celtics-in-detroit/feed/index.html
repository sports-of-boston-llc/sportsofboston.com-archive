		<description><![CDATA[Once again, an embarrassing performance against a second rate team.  I suppose the Celtics are now officially a second rate team as well.  Maybe everybody will stop getting up for them now that they&#039;ve shown just what they&#039;re made of. Pierce and Rondo are the only bright spots.  I would have included Perkins, but his inability to set a pick without fouling, and his woeful passing of late, is offsetting his shot blocking and high shooting percentage.  I can&#039;t even begin to understand our bench.  Baby looks totally lost out there, House is completely undependable, Sheldon Williams is invisible, and Tony Allen has no offensive coherence.  Meanwhile, Doc continues to ignore the existence of Walker and Giddens and I fully expect them to be traded for another ancient veteran to some team that actually gives them a chance to become stars.
It&#039;s getting damned hard to even watch these guys.  There is no team in the league except New Jersey - maybe - that can&#039;t take them out in the second half.  Old age?  Disinterest?  Misplaced cockiness?  Take your pick.]]></description>
