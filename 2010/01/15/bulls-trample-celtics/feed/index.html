		<description><![CDATA[Rondo looked awfully slow against the Bulls. His legs weren&#039;t with him, and Rose was blowing past him left and right. Sometimes broadcasters say that players are tired, and you really have to look for what they are talking about. However, with Rondo, it was staggering how bad he looked. Give the man some time off. Please! Get Lester Hudson back to take off some pressure.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d like to add a &quot;Dear Doc Rivers&quot; question/statement to Sharkey&#039;s points:  Dear Doc - When your team has no energy and is clearly falling apart with fatigue, what do you have to lose by putting some young bodies out there (remember those guys named Walker and Giddens?), giving them a chance to rejuvenate things, and seeing if, maybe, just maybe they can add something to a pathetic performance against a team you should beat by 20 points?  Learn something from history, Doc.  Here&#039;s two words for you to consider: Joe Johnson.  Another youngster who was allowed to migrate away from the Celts without a fair shake.]]></description>
