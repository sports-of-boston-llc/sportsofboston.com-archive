		<description><![CDATA[Well such a low score is to be expected in Week 17 (except for Dev&#039;s team)...especially considering almost the ENTIRE NFC (except for the Cowboys, Eagles, and Vikings -- I didn&#039;t have any players from these teams...) was playing for nothing!

I&#039;ll take the title game win. I had some big victories on the way to the Championship round, so I deserved to earn the 29-point win despite scoring just 77 points. What happened to Dan?!?!?!]]></description>
