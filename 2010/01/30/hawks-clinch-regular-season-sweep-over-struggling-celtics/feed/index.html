		<description><![CDATA[Ken - I couldn&#039;t agree with you more. Sheed has to start changing the way he plays, and that means playing like a power forward and taking less three-pointers. If Doc Rivers isn&#039;t going to step up and coach this team, Kevin Garnett needs to take Wallace aside and have a little chat. I&#039;ve been critical of Doc in some of my recent posts. I think it&#039;s fairly evident that he has lost control of the ship at this point.

I&#039;ve also, like you, been puzzled by Doc&#039;s reluctancy to get Walker and Giddens minutes, while Scalabrine continues to show he stinks. After the C&#039;s recent stretch of losses, what does this team have to lose by playing their young athletes? 

Right now their second unit is garbage. They can&#039;t seem to hold a lead to save their lives. I can&#039;t count how many times of I&#039;ve seen Glen Davis get rejected as he moves in slow motion toward the basket, how many three-pointers I&#039;ve seen Rasheed Wallace brick, or how many times I&#039;ve seen Brian Scalabrine get blown away by superior athletes.

I hate to continue being the harbinger of bad news, and maybe the return of Marquis Daniels will give the second unit a boost, but right now this team is in serious trouble. We&#039;ll see what happens against the Lakers on Sunday afternoon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Imagine if Danny went after Jamal Crawford as a sixth man instead of Rasheed Wallace last offseason. If Wallace played like a big man, then I&#039;d prefer him. The Celtics could use help up front.

Instead, Sheed is playing like Jamal Crawford, only he&#039;s a worse shooter. I like a big man that can stretch the floor...but that&#039;s different than a big man afraid to play down low.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For me, the most telling moment of last night&#039;s game actually took place after the game at Doc&#039;s press conference.  When it was suggested that Rasheed was taking too many 3 pointers, Doc forcefully stated that if a 3 point shooter were open, he wanted that shooter to always take the shot, or else Doc would put him on the bench.  In a nutshell, we see what gives a guy like Rasheed the rationale to keep doing what he does poorly.  The coach expects him to take the shot, and despite his dismal 3 point percentage, he&#039;s getting the green light to keep on doing it, no matter how silly it looks and how much it hurts the team. Of course he&#039;s open - the opposing team would much rather he take that shot than work in the post. I can&#039;t imagine how a professional coach could defend such an insane philosophy.  Can you imagine a baseball manager telling a player to &quot;keep on swinging for the fences even though you consistently strike out&quot;?  Doesn&#039;t seem much different than telling a lousy 3 point shooter to keep on shooting despite the fact that he  consistently misses.

In closing, I&#039;m also so happy to see Doc givng a few playing minutes to his top athlete, Brian Scalabrine.  It&#039;s always such a pleasure to see him in there while a guy like Walker continues to rot on the bench and Giddens remains banished to the D league.  And kudos to Doc for emphasizing the importance of shutting down Jamal Crawford.  His coaching plan to stop Jamal worked great last night as the Celts managed to keep Jamal from scoring 30.  28 is, of course, completely acceptable.]]></description>
