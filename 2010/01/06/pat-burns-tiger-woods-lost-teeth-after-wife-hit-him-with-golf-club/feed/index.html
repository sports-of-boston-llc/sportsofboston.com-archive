		<description><![CDATA[The money and fame is the reason he was able to carry on the life of Hugh Heffner, and it will allow him to survive the gigantic loss in endorsements and divorce fees.

I didn&#039;t say having the money will make things ok! I was just saying he was worth over $1 billion, and the financial hit will be huge, but not enough to bankrupt him. Read it word-for-word again:

&quot;Eventually, the entire story will be known, but not before Tiger loses over $100 million in divorce fees, endorsements, and lost wages (while he’s not playing golf). Still, he’s probably the richest athlete in sports.&quot;

Bob, get your eyes checked. Zing!]]></description>
