		<description><![CDATA[It was sad to watch Garnett hobbling after Lewis on that final basket.  In the old days, he&#039;d have blocked him easily.  What a difference a bum knee makes.

Horrible performance by Perkins in every regard.  I think he&#039;s read too many stories about how great he is against Howard. He looked like a chump out there last night.

It was nice to see somebody on a different team looking old for a change.  Carter was pathetic for Orlando. Maybe the Celts should trade Giddens and Walker for him so that our team could look all-around ancient and nobody could criticize Doc for letting young talent waste away on the bench or in the D league.]]></description>
