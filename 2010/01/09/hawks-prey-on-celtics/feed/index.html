		<description><![CDATA[I get the impression that nobody can tell Rasheed anything.  It&#039;s sad to see so much obvious talent go to waste, and though I never again thought I&#039;d see a Celtic as insanely obsessed as Antoine Walker with making an ass of himself from the 3 point line...well, Rasheed is cut from the same cloth.  I just think he&#039;s lazy and totally selfish.  It takes hard work to be an effective rebounder or low post player, and though the skill is there, I&#039;m afraid the will is lacking.  Much easier to hoist up the ball from beyond the arc, and it&#039;s just too damned bad if it hurts the team.

Man, does this team need Garnett in there!  But I&#039;m afraid Sharkey&#039;s all too right when he points out that the age/health issue is a fatal flaw.  Unless everyone suddenly gets healthy right before the playoffs, the Celts have no chance for a title.]]></description>
