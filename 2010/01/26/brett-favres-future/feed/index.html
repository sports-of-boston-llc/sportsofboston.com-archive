		<description><![CDATA[Hey Brett,
I think that what you are doing is awesome. I was and still am your biggest fan! I wrote a letter to you in the third grade at St. Joeseph school a while back. I&#039;ll be going into the tenth grade this year. I know that you&#039;re no longer with the pack any more, but if you could ever happen to email back at this address then that would be totally awesome! Maybe we can become friends! Anyway can&#039;t wait to watch you this year!
