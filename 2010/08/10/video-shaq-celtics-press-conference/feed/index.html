		<description><![CDATA[I love the Boston Celtics and I do not like the fact they signed Shaq. I am from Phoenix and was not happy when the Suns signed him in 2008. The Celtics are a team similar to the Suns. They are a fast-paced, defensive team. And Shaq is neither. Shaw just does not fit into the mold of the Celtic&#039;s team. He says he understands where he is in his career and is okay with playing &quot;a role&quot;, but for some reason I do not think he will play the role he should be playing. Glen &quot;Big Baby&quot; Davis deserves a starting spot despite other forward&#039;s height advantage over him. He plays great defense and always gives 100% effort. S A player like that makes good things happen. A player like Shaq is way past his prime and I do not think he deserves much playing time. I think with him being who he is, he will still play more than he should because of money! 

On a more positive note, I think if the Celtics utilize his size, talent and age correctly his presence could be extremely beneficial to the team. 2011 NBA Championship here we come!]]></description>
