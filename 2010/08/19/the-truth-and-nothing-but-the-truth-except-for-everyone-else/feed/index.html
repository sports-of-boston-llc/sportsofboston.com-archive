		<description><![CDATA[I agree, if they don&#039;t retire #34, it&#039;s a travesty. Also.. Pierce may not have an iconic moment like &quot;Havlicek stole the ball&quot; but don&#039;t forget his dive across the floor in game 7 of the 2008 Cavs series (where he out-dueled LeBron with 41 points), or when he got injured in the Lakers series and came back with those 2 threes in the 2nd half. 

Either way, good call with Havlicek, the guy is still insanely underrated.]]></description>
