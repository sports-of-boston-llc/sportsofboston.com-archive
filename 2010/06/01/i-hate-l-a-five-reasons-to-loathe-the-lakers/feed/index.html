		<description><![CDATA[Yeah how&#039;d those XI hats work out? Who cares if his kids made them? I enjoyed seeing them all walk dejectedly down the hall. Guess you shoulda waited till you were IN the finals before you got all cocky and thought 11 would be a sure thing.

Eat it Laker fans! Blown out in humiliating fashion by the Mavs! Odom and Bynums thugery sum up your organization.... classless, dirty, and cheap. 

Gotta love Kobe&#039;s quote about coming back from 0-3. &quot;It happens all the time in hockey...&quot;  ummmm, NO. No Kobe it doesn&#039;t. You are as ignorant as you are self absorbed. Complete denial. It&#039;s over, and your career is in its twilight. Give up, pack it in and call it done. You are&#039;nt Michael Jordan, and you have none of the personality of Earvin Johnson. Without Phil Jackson Kobe is NOTHING. Phil holds the Lakers together, and keeps that team focused amidst the B.S. complaining and Blaming Kobe does. Think Kobe&#039;s teammates are gonna take his crap now without a proven coach at the helm? No. The best thing Kobe can do for all you Lakers fans is call it quits and give you a fresh start.

Of course being a Celtics fan I enjoy any and all pain I see a Lakers fan in. Bwaaaahahahaha!!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For the record: Phil Jackson’s kids MADE the hat for him. What was he supposed to do? Say, “No thanks, kids. Go screw.”?  At least TRY to accurately report the facts.

And just so you know, Boston Whiners, Phil and his loyal fans are now wearing the new &quot;XI&quot; hats.
