		<description><![CDATA[This summary of the report was spot on, Boston gave this win away to the Lakers.  LA played horrible, when a team shoots 32% versus the opponents 41% usually the later wins most of the time, Lakers was lucky to get this win even when they struggle for 3 quarters of this game.  Perkins out was a big loss for Celtics and could have been a big factor for the C&#039;s loss, no presence of a big body in the paint to help defend.  Nice try better luck next year.]]></description>
