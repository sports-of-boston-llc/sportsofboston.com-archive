		<description><![CDATA[I completely agree that you take the championship when you can.  Nothing is guaranteed in the league and the successes of most NBA franchises tend to run in cycles.  If the C&#039;s hadn&#039;t won the championship a few years back - then when?  As a Mavs fan, we had our chance in &#039;06 and couldn&#039;t get it done.  Now we compete but with an aging roster and free agency, I&#039;m not yet convinced we&#039;ll wear a ring any time soon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I bounce back and forth on this. Sometimes, I drool at the thought of a Rondo-Durant-Jefferson-Perk core (with the veteran Pierce too). I think Rondo&#039;s development would be slower than it has been...but on the face it&#039;s still pretty damn impressive. But, I always stick to my guns in the end: if you win the NBA Title, that&#039;s all that counts. Period.

It reminds me of trading Hanley Ramirez for Josh Beckett and Mike Lowell. Had Theo not made that trade, the Red Sox would not have won the 2007 World Series.]]></description>
