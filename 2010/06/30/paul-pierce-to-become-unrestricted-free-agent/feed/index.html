		<description><![CDATA[I love Paul Pierce.  I do.  But this is a dick move.  Only way it makes sense is if he&#039;s had a backdoor conversation with Ainge in which he agrees to retire after 2 years of the deal.  At his age, Pierce is asking for far more than his worth, and forcing the C&#039;s to commit more money to staying old, when he could be taking a pay cut for the C&#039;s to make a serious run at Boozer or David Lee.

I can&#039;t say I understand this.  From afar, it looks like a money grab by a guy who has always been classier than that.  Problem is, with the way Danny has shown zero loyalty to his stars (he just wants to win, and it&#039;s hard to fault him for that, but that DOES have consequences), Pierce probably feels threatened that after next year, Ainge will undoubtedly let him go/put pressure on him to retire.

I don&#039;t know that I see this ending well for either side  .  As much as I don&#039;t like Boston placing one MORE hat into the ring for this year&#039;s free agent crop and basing their future on that, I think a team that&#039;s paying Pierce the max for 4 more years is far more likely to be a first round out than a contender.]]></description>
