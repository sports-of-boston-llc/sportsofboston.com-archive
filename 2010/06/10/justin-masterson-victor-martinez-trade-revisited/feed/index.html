		<description><![CDATA[I think it was still a good trade. The Red Sox with Victor Martinez had a good enough roster to make it deep into the playoffs. They didn&#039;t, but it wasn&#039;t because of the trade.

The Red Sox sold high on Masterson, who proceeded to struggle in Cleveland. He had issues getting out left-handed batters and some trouble with the long ball. That said, the Sox continued to try and reacquire him.

In the meantime, we can look at Matt Barnes, drafted by the Red Sox this June with the Tigers&#039; first round pick. He might let the Red Sox &quot;TiVo&quot; a Masterson-type pitcher for a future day when the team doesn&#039;t have such a crowded rotation.]]></description>

Martinez equaled a free agent compensation pick, but Masterson has turned into an elite AL SP for dirt cheap.  The Sox would have been unstoppable with Lester Masterson and Beckett.]]></description>
