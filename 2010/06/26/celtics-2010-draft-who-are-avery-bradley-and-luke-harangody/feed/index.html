		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m fairly sure they picked Bradley because they think someone&#039;s going to overpay Tony Allen.  Fits the same mold of a tenacious defender who&#039;s a little small for the 2, can&#039;t create for himself, but will run the break.

It&#039;s also worth mentioning that Bradley was an absolute stud coming out of high school, and if the C&#039;s can keep him long enough to let him develop (i.e. no Chauncey Billups routine), he could turn out to be a gamer.  I can&#039;t imagine a scenario in which you can start two 6&#039;1 guards and Rondo&#039;s obviously the team&#039;s future BUT Dallas has had good luck with Terry coming off the bench, and then playing with Kidd in crunch time.  So it&#039;s not like it&#039;s unthinkable that in 4 years, Rondo/Bradley would be the end-of-game backcourt if this kid&#039;s game improves.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kind of concerned that they drafted Avery Bradley. He may have been the best player available overall, but I&#039;d say that the PG spot is the least of our worries. Avery does play the 2, but he&#039;s been a PG as well. And being known for his defense is a strange reason to draft him if you&#039;re the Celtics. We didn&#039;t win the finals because we couldn&#039;t score, not because we couldn&#039;t defend. And I&#039;m so tired of watching almost the entire team settle for jumpshots the entire season. A guard who shot 54% on an average of 2 free throws a game?! A mediocre guard who unquestionably needs work before he&#039;s solidified in the NBA seems almost a senseless move by Boston. I guess we&#039;ll see.

I&#039;m pumped about Luke, though. I think that was a true steal.]]></description>
