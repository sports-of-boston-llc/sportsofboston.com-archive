		<description><![CDATA[------They just dont get it.  Still no mention at all,pro or con,of the flange/bolts on all the news.   Some of the bloggers that do are top engineers withiin the industry.------
The oil leak can be TOTALLY controlled in half a week. Replacing the flange atop the BOP with a riser is absolutely possible,even in that blast. A pre-assembled guide---four 40 ft pcs drill pipe--- with a five ft diameter band connecting the top ends, and solidly mounted on the BOP flange below,will steer the new riser perfectly, over the drill pipe stub and down, with 2 tapered pins on the new flange, precisely aligning it for bolting. A manifold with 4 lines to the surface completes it,redundantly accomplishing more than the present cap, only with positively NO leaking at all, and no sea water to &quot;freeze&quot;. After working the giant shear, these tasks,including clamping before unbolting, and trimming projections on the flange,etc. are comparatively simple for the robot operators.   Please hurry.]]></description>
