		<description><![CDATA[Well i don&#039;t hope his carrer is over, this would be a bad thing for him and Perk will get better... ya im a lakers fan and i hate Boston but Perk dont deserve to have his carrer end that way.
Honnestly I hope he play just like Bynum do and we&#039;ll see how LA is better than the C&#039;s.
When you are fan of a team... Sorry you part of it man; if there is no fan there is no team... Well I don&#039;t consider my self as part of there succes but i like the team i want them to win really bad: and i think this is kinda be part of the team (emotionnaly)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Boston Sux,
Nice. Classy. I&#039;m not a fan of either team, but it&#039;s funny you talk about karma when you wish a dude&#039;s career is over. Just remember, you still work your shitty job...being a fan of overpaid teams like the Lakers or Yankees doesn&#039;t actually make you part of the team. Kobe is getting his $33mil next year whether he wins or not, and winning another title is another achievement for him....you don&#039;t get s**t from it except sorry excuses to act like you are somehow part of the team. But you still have to go back to your insignificance. Have fun!]]></description>
