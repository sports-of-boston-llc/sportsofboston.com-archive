		<description><![CDATA[Even without getting the official title of perfect game, because of the controversy people will probably remember Galarraga&#039;s night long after they forget about Dallas Braden or even Roy Halladay.

If Joyce had immediately changed his mind meeting with the umpires it could have been somewhat salvaged officially but they didn&#039;t go down that road.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe I&#039;m a baseball purist...but as soon as another batter (the 28th hitter) stepped up to the plate, it automatically can&#039;t be a perfect game. That&#039;s what makes perfectos so special. What do they do, pretend he didn&#039;t come to the plate with a runner on in the ninth? Once you erase that situation, you&#039;re messing too much with the record books. 

If the umps huddled, and then paused the game to call Selig, and he decided it was a perfect game, then that&#039;s OK. Because technically it was 27 up, 27 down.

Galarraga recorded the final out with a runner on base. That&#039;s what it says in the books...so that by definition is not perfect.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t see why the game shouldn&#039;t be overturned; it definitely can be. All Selig has to do is say, &quot;It&#039;s a perfect game,&quot; and presto.

It&#039;s not the replay issue that&#039;s harming the integrity of the game, as everyone seems to think. It&#039;s the blatant screwed up calls like this that&#039;s harming the integrity of the game. Even the umpire admitted the call was wrong.

If the higher ups approve of wrong doings like they do, the game will get less and less popular, and more and more meaningless.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great point, Grant. The George Brett homerun actually changed the outcome of the game, however. If it counted, the Royals won. If not, the Yankees won. In this instance, regardless of a perfect game or not, the outcome would be the same. If we&#039;re talking the difference between a win or a loss, there&#039;s a whole different issue at hand. Since he retired the next batter and the score remained the same, a protest wouldn&#039;t make a ton of sense. When it comes down to it, the win/loss record is all that truly matters.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, after thinking it over, they really can&#039;t award him a perfect game. As soon as another batter stepped to the plate and recorded an official plate appearance, it&#039;s impossible to call Galarraga&#039;s game perfect. Because it took 28 hitters (even though he technically retired them all).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve got to agree with you Justin.  Gut thought was that this play had to be overturned, but baseball has always been flawed to human error. I know its a far cry, but how many other 1 hitters may have been broken up in the earlier part of a game by a bad call?  Should we go back and change all those?

The only question I do have regarding this all is why the game was not played under Protest.  If you recall, the Yankees/Royals game way back was replayed because of the error on a home run call in the George Brett game.]]></description>
