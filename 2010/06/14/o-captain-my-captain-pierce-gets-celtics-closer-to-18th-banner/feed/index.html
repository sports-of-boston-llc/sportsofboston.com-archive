		<description><![CDATA[For the Celts to be in position to win it all tonight in Game 6 is nothing less than the genius of Doc Rivers who was smart enough to sacrifice the latter part of the season to get his veterans healthy and ready for the play-offs. Clearly Doc has out-coached every coach in the post-season. It will be so sweet to get that win tonight for him and for the veterans who want so badly to be mentioned in the same breath with the other great Celtics teams. Paul Pierce especially deserves this championship to propel him to status of greatness. We love you, Paul. So glad you hung in there through some really tough years.
Thanks, Doc, for being ever the gentleman as you prepare your team to disrupt the very best in the NBA with killer defense. You are truly a role model for all generations!
Good luck tonight.
