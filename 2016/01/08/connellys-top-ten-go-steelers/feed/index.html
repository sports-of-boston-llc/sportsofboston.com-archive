		<description><![CDATA[Big difference between Isaiah Thomas and Antoine Walker - Isaiah is a point guard.  His 2.7 TO per game and 2.5 TO per assist are middle of the pack numbers for a point.  Isaiah is not the problem - he&#039;s the Celtics best player.  He is being forced to carry more of the scoring load than is optimal since nobody else on the team can throw it in the ocean.

REPLY - MPC - I agree Isiah is really the ideal 6th man - Antoine did run the point a lot from his position]]></description>
