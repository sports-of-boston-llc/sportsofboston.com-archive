		<description><![CDATA[Agree on the Cam race issue. whether he is black or white he is acting like a spoiled pompous d-bag

I don&#039;t see Gronk in Tibet.  Could see Miami beach, Hawaii, Vegas or Brazil.  he likes to have too much fun to go to Tibet.  Plus it is frigin&#039; cold there

REPLY - MPC - Good point Gronk could look like Brando in Apocalypse Now]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Couldn&#039;t agree more with your comments about Cam Newton.  His Heisman win just felt kind of icky with all the crap surrounding it.

He&#039;s such a good player.  He&#039;s a talented pitch man as well - like Manning.  He&#039;s certainly getting rewarded for his talents.  

People may not like him because he&#039;s cocky and arrogant, not because of his race.  Most of the opposing players that criticize him are black themselves - it&#039;s not race, it&#039;s your behavior.

I&#039;m so sick of sports commentators trying to build up their street cred among the other swells in the newsrooms by feeding into it as well.  Dan Lebotard says that you have to really look inside yourself to realize that you have a problem with him because of his race.

I personally kind of liked the guy, but he lost me a bit this week because of this race crap.  You&#039;re so right about this - it diminishes the argument.

Reply - Really strange almost like he saw value in jumping on the Oscar bandwagon]]></description>
