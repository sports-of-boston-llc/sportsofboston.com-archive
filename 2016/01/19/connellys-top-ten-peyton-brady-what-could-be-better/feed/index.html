		<description><![CDATA[Ed Hochuli will be the Ref Sunday. Denver is 7-0 when Hochuli Refs. Pats are 3-4. How can the NFL think this is OK. Bet the house on Denver.

REPLY - MPC - Although Ed had nothing to do with it - wish I listened to you]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[All turnovers are automatically reviewed so never have a case where a coach would have to challenge to overturn a turnover called on the field. Toussaint&#039;s fumble wasn&#039;t nearly as bad as Hill&#039;s the week before that got Pitt to Denver. Totally agree on Carey, they need to fix that.

REPLY - MPC - If Carey comes back then he is there for other reasons]]></description>
