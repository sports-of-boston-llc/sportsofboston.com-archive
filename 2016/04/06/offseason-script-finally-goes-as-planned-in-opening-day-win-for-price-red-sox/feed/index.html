		<description><![CDATA[Not knocking only on Boston as every single team during that out of control drug induced baseball era was on the stuff!  Everyone!  So I guess you could say you won it fair and square because your guys were better while on roids then the other teams were!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, I just can&#039;t get off this subject!  This guy better NOT MAKE THE HOF!  Todd Helton!  Why?  All you gotta do is look back and see how his numbers dipped during the 2005 season After the March 2005 Congressional Hearings!  You remember, McGwire pleading the fifth and Palmeiro &quot;I have never used steroids, period!&quot;  Please check out Helton&#039;s career after that March 2005 hearings.  Note in 2005 it was the last season he ever hit at least 20 homers!  And that was because he still had the juice in him.  At least he was smart enough to quit!  But what upsets me is he gets so indignant when asked or accused of using steroids!  This guy like Bagwell, Biggio (who got in) Molitor and numerous others were on the stuff and it just hurts me that these crooks are gonna be honored in such a way that only deserved guys like Frank Thomas who I believe was absolutely clean should be!  Anyway I just gotta complain about these guys because I hate what they did!  At the very least McGwire was honest enough to plead the fifth and in fact honestly came out and admitted it later after retirement.  But not counting Canseco, he&#039;s the only major star player to admit it!]]></description>
