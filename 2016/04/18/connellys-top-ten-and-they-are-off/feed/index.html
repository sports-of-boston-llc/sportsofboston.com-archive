		<description><![CDATA[Another good column. I just had one comment to add concerning the Celtics. It sure looked like the Hawks got away with two blatant travels late in the game. The non-calls led to four key points total. As for Randomocity, always thought J. Geils Band deserved more accolades. Their concerts were so full of energy and great music. Never liked the Cars. Boston should have been so much better, simply took too long to release their second album.

REPLY - MPC - I would like to have a computer monitor game and count how many travels go uncalled in nba game]]></description>
