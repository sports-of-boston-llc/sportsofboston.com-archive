		<description><![CDATA[Margo, most conservatives have larger ones because they make no attempt to reduce carbon emissions, BTW, and ad hominem arguments don&#039;t make you correct. The larger point is this should be a place for sports, not for people who don&#039;t know the science to post about global warming, including Mr. Connelly, whose sports opinions I don&#039;t always agree with, but I respect. But science and politics belong in another sphere.

REPLY MPC - 0.7 I&#039;m going to graduate!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Glo-Bull Warming is an extortion racket and those who kneel at the alter should be arrested under the RICO act.
Al Gore (as do most liberals) have a carbon footprint the size of RI.

REPLY - MPC - I think at one point Gore had the biggest footprint in Tennessee]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;2015 was globally the warmest year since records began in 1880, according to NASA and NOAA. ...Fifteen of the 16 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001.&quot; 

You know more about this than NASA and NOAA?

REPLY - MPC - I love it - I with Kevin there are changes going on but there have been changes since the big bang - how did the ice melt originally - because of some 4x4 being rode around my some willy mammoth? How do they know the cause. What caused dust bowl in the 30&#039;s how come more tornado&#039;s in the 50&#039;s - temps are up but who knows why - some guy with a pen protector who once saw a polar bear frown]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Spot on for no.9 today

Vermont K, it&#039;s funny how the earth regulates itself.  one of the benefits (yes benefits) from the ice caps in Greenland melting are the amount of nutrients now feeding the plankton (which was dying due to global warming).  The earth is in a cycle of warming, no doubt, but let&#039;s not be so naive to think human actions can stop changes that have been taking place for 100&#039;s of millions of years.  Should we lessen fossil fuel use, should we develop new clean energy YES, but not under the ruse of it &quot;stopping&quot; climate change, to believe that your (environmental nazi&#039;s) EGO must be massive.  here is why i don&#039;t like to spend on fossil fuel, CAUSE I AM CHEAP!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Weather does not equal climate, Mike. Give it a rest. Check the melting ice at the poles and stick to sports.

reply - mpc - I knew I would get a rise out of you!
