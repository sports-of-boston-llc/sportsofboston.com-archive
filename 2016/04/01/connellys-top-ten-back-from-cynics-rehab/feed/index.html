		<description><![CDATA[Welcome Back! 
Chicago&#039;s a rats nest for racist &#038; radicals. Alinsky, Ayers, Obama, Farahkan, et al The Weather Underground, Chicago Eight, SDS... All still active in some form or fashion. 
As for Chicago&#039;s murder rate, it&#039;s not a gun problem but a thug problem. And our pols including Eric Holder are cowards to not discuss the real problem.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great to have you back, Michael.  I hope you&#039;re wrong about the Sox.  Pats free agency was well done - let&#039;s hope they all pan out, especially Bennett.

Looking forward to your take on Sox for the rest of the summer.

REPLY - MPC - LEts hope its a fun positive summer]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Welcome BACK!!
3. would trade very pick and half current team to get durrant on a long term deal
8. was that when they played 150 games as well? so probably 12-16 less hits/season
10. Harper Lee knew what she was doing, had a BK dog and it was a 4.5 out of 10, Scalia book is up your alley?, Chicago is Obama&#039;s home town right?

REPLY - MPC - You have cap space overpay for Durant but you have to hit a grandslam with a draft move before Durant will be convinced / So much for his Chicago town organizing]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great to see you back.  Missed the Top Ten.

Great stuff as always. Crazy about Chicago.

REPLY - MPC - Chicago hoods are no different than ISIS right now - killing and shooting without regard for human life but the country seems to be ignoring for some insane reason]]></description>
