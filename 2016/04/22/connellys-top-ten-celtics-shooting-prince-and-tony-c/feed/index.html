		<description><![CDATA[Ditto, &quot; I hate the media&quot; re: Manny Ramirez and Sandusky. You know the media knew what was going on but for sake of access and free $H!T refuse to report what they know. Continue&#039;s to this day. Media is complicit.

REPLY - MPC - I agree - they want to be friends with players that ignored them in high school]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Stay on the Chicago thing.  

The Wall St Journal wrote an interesting piece a few months ago about The Justice Department under President Obama and Eric Holder.  They are always speaking about gun control, yet they have prosecuted 45% less cases of gun violence than President Bush&#039;s justice department did.

They are more concerned about Bubba at a hunting and fishing expo getting a gun than they are about people getting shot in Chicago.  They view them as a core constituency so they go easy on the people that are actually involved in criminal activity.  Instead they look to criminalize people that are rarely a problem.

If this were happening in a conservative stronghold there would be non-stop coverage.  There would be an odometer on the home page of the Boston Globe counting the shootings every week.

There can be a terrorist event and it turns into a discussion about gun control.  There are over 1,000 people shot in one city in 100 days and they shooters aren&#039;t being hunted down like they should.  

Let&#039;s address problems for what they are and then maybe we can solve them.

REPLY - MPC - I&#039;m shocked the Chicago community is allowing it]]></description>
