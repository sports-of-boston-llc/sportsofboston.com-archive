		<description><![CDATA[Kaepernick is ridiculous.  He was abandoned by his black father before he was even born.  He was adopted and raised by a white couple and given tremendous opportunity to succeed.  He&#039;s always come across to me like an entitled punk.  

I don&#039;t get why Black Lives Matter is not called out as being based on lies.  All these well off celebrities and white limosine liberal hypocrites lionize the so called &quot;victims&quot; of these police shootings yet say nothing about the crime that takes place every day in the inner cities.  

Every time one of these cases goes before a jury and the facts are presented (not by the media ever - just to the jury)the result is the same.  Three different autopsies proved that the story told about the Michael Brown shooting was a complete lie.  Hands up don&#039;t shoot was a complete lie.  That started this whole Black Lives Matter movement.  He says that is his motivation...  

He needs to just go away.  He&#039;s guaranteed $12,000,000 this year to underperform on his contract.  He&#039;s talking about oppression? 

I would cut him today.

Reply MPC - This is a sad period in American history. I know from my perspective - I don&#039;t have direct experience with the &quot;oppression&quot; he speaks of - but with that said - no one can argue the fact that rioting over Michael Brown (now since justified killing) and not at the same time being active in the solution in Chicago makes that movement at best hypocritical. In my opinion (based only on my perspective again) is that Black Lives Matter actually discriminates against those killed in black on black crime by not appearing to take an interest in that issue - as if the value of their lives is somewhat less. Its a riddle that isn&#039;t being solved especially from the White House which might be this president&#039;s lasting legacy (you won&#039;t hear that on CNN). 

Colin Kapernick was an elite athlete who was treated like a god since he started Pop Warner - his parents (white), his coach at Nevada was Chris Ault (white) who put him in an offense that fit his skill set perfectly allowing him to be drafted by the 49ers where Jim Harbaugh (white) gave him an amazing opportunity to shine and make money. Oppression to me is the Holocaust or the Armenian genocide, or slavery, British purge of Irish - Not making $11mm for throwing 6 touchdowns a year - 

I would give him a forum on CNN or ABC to discuss the oppression he has suffered and what exactly has he done to make the community a better place. I bet you would get crickets]]></description>
