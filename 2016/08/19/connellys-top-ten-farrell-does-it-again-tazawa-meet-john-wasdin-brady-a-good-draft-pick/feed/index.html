		<description><![CDATA[when i think of all those names, the first word that comes to mind is &quot;outstanding&quot;.  HA.  mike adams is a hack.  the only talent on EEI roster is holley and thornton.  the rest... meh.  old, washed up and out of touch.

REPLY - MPC - Bad time for sports radio right now - you have to have Neumie and Sean McDonough as contributors in this town - more Jackie McMullan, and her type - the old Ordway with two guests]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Callahan, Dennis, Ordway, Merloni Holley, Thornton &#038; Adams are all outstanding. WEEI should do themselves a favor and deep six Minahan, Arnold &#038; Tanguay. Three in the booth blows. 
Ditto 98.5 morning show. Zo &#038; Shepard were good. Too much whining on Mr Underwood &#038; Maz.

REPLY - MPC - Never laughed at one thing Mike Adams said - Tanguay, Mut, Stearns - all the same]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[just because you aren&#039;t target demo for toucher and rich doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s a clown show.  I enjoy the levity in the morning after sleepless nights and waking up to crying baby
while &quot;eagerly&quot; awaiting my morning commute.  D&#038;C are ignorant, borderline racist and definitely sexist jerks.  no thanks, glad to bid good riddance to Dino.  his Twitter feed, which is toxic, tells me all I need to know about him.

REPLY - MPC - You must love the 98.5 rap battle - bunch of white guys sounding like clowns]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Crazy stat about the number of games started by Brady vs all the others - good find.

I agree with the observation about Bolt.  He&#039;s cocky, but very likable.  Must see TV when he runs.

REPLY - MPC - Being the fastest man in the world makes you a Diva but seems like a likable diva]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[True story: I told a coworker yesterday I had good news and bad news. The good news, Sox just scored two runs to take the lead. Bad news, Tazawa entering the game. 
One correction, Dombrowski did not trade &quot;gems&quot; for all those pitchers. We can debate whether the prospects in most of the trades pan out or not, but for the sake of discussion let&#039;s call them gems. But he traded Wade Miley for Carson Smith. Wade Miley stinks. 7-10 5.23 this year pitching mostly in Seattle&#039;s pitcher friendly park.

REPLY - MPC - fair point - not a gem]]></description>
