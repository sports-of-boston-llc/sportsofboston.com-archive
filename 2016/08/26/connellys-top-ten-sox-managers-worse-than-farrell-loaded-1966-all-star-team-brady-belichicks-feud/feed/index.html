		<description><![CDATA[Hmm, Brooks AS game MVP on losing team.  I respect your perspective of Brooks being &quot;one of the most over rated players in history&quot;.  After all we&#039;re fans and one of the best parts of the game is fans comparing and contrasting our own perspectives.  But, from MLB.com some comparisons.  To your point Wade beats Brooks handily with regular season offensive stats.  Also:
-  WS MVP, Brooks (B)-1, Wade (W)-0
- AS MVP, B-1, W-0
- Silver Slug, B-0, W-8
- Gold Glv, B-16, W-2
- AS Games, B-18, W-12

Postseason stats (some cities measure success by this)
- Games, B-39, W-39
- WS Titles, B-2, W-1 (.158 BA, yanks carried)
- BA, B-.303, W-.273
- OBP, B-.331, W-.337
- SLG, B-.462, W-.383
- OPS, B-.793, W-.720
- HR, B-5, W-2
- RBI, B-21, W-16
- Strike outs, B-9, W-20

Oh, and Brooks was a good guy winning the Roberto Clemente award for; Sportsmanship, community and contribution to team.

Remember that iconic hit or play by Wade?....Brooks?

It&#039;s a toss up but I&#039;ll stick with &quot;the Human Vacuum Cleaner&quot; (Rushmore in Balt), over &quot;The Chicken Man&quot;.

REPLY - No question who was the better citizen - Boggs had 200 more hits in 85% of the games - hit 61 points higher and obp was 100 points higher also slugging numbers were better - boggs turned himself into a good third baseman - I appreciate your side though]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hard to argue your list of bad Sox managers.  My personal angst was and still is with Zimmer and his ineptness while blowing the pennant in 1978.

REPLY - MPC - I actually think Zim was under-rated manager - won 99 games and was good with Cubs]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Was at Tropicana all 4 games this week. Subtract about 12,000 from your total would give more accurate attendance 33,478, about 8,369 per game. It&#039;s a fact the Rays count no show season ticket holders, about 3000 per game. And I&#039;d estimate about 6000 of the 8369 were Sox fans. Heard Fauria refer to it as Fenway South!

REPLY - Crazy that can&#039;t be good for the sport - go to San Jose or somewhere else]]></description>
