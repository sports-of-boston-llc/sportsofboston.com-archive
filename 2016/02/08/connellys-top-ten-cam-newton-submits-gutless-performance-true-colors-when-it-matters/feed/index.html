		<description><![CDATA[Agree on the Ginn out of bounds and Cam looking at his fumble on the ground. Incredible lack of effort. Also interesting to me was the end of the game - Carolina ran a play, got flagged and there was a ten second runoff. With one second left on the clock they showed Peyton and Kubiak. What about the football? What happened on the field. Did Carolina just walk off?

REPLY - MPC - CBS terrible job - couldn&#039;t believe how bad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Horrible game. Cam jumping back left Nance and Simms virtually speechless. Virtually.
CBS glossed over the Brown concussion. The second he got up, he was staggering, walking dizzy towards sideline. CBS cut away from him, showed the catch, then reported the concussion later.
Think about that. Any injury that takes a player out of the game is typically shown ad naseaum. But showing a man who sacrificed his head for his catch, then zig zagging bsck to the bench, was an indictment of head trauma dangers. Dangers that the NFL touts itself for talking care of, after over a decade of being assailed by unmpeachable evidence.
Yes Cam was a coward, but money-grubb ing NFL and CBS have had him beat for awhile.

REPLY - MPC- Can&#039;t agree with you more - this a multi billion dollar business - nfl has sat down with all of the tv people and said steer away from concussions as much as possible]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Watching Cam sleep walk through this game reminded me of Donavan McNab. 
Broncos 14-0 when Hocholi and Blakeman Ref. Call bee ess on NFL to allow this to happen. &quot;Integrity of The Game&quot;
Having Crotchery&#039;s catch ruled incomplete hurt Carolina on the scoreboard and for timeouts and future challenges.
BC and UMass are a disgrace in the region.

REPLY  MPC - Crotchery call is huge play no doubt]]></description>
