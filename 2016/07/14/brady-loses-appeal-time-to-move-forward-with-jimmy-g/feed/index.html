		<description><![CDATA[Well your writer has once again got it right. And had very eloquently said what all of us in Patriot Nation know to be a fact. Roger Godell has such a hard on for &quot;Tom Terrific&quot; that he ignores the facts of the issue and pronounces Tom guilty before proven innocent. Dictatorships don&#039;t work Period!!! The rule of law is in place to let the evidence be heard. Reminds me of the movie Casino, where Ace Rothstien(Robert Denero) goes before the Gaming board to get his Casino license. The facts where never heard and his request was summarily denied!!! But I hope your writer is correct in saying that Garrapolo will shine and with Tom well rested into the middle of the season, it can only bode well for the Past. Belicheck has a way of handling adversity and getting his players to rise to the occasion. Playing beyond what anyone thought was possible. Yes Belicheck is the master of getting the most out of his players and forming that intangible trait called cohesion?? spell check??? So take the rest Tom and enjoy it!!! We await your return.]]></description>
