		<description><![CDATA[I completely agree about the Olympics. I&#039;ve been saying for years that they should just hold the Summer Olympics in Greece every four years.

Pick a spot for the winter and we&#039;re done. It&#039;s crazy all the drama that surrounds every Olympics. It seems like it never has the economic benefit that it&#039;s supposed to for the host city - just a bunch of bloated beurocrats getting fat payouts. 

The Olympics are awesome but I hate the story lines about the host city&#039;s problems muddying the events

REPLY - MPC - The horror stories from Rio will be historical]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Re: Tanana and Fidrych. We all know what happened to The Bird. Tigers burned him out. And that was Tanana&#039;s age 23 year. He had one more good year, one pretty good, and then he was shot. All those CGs killed their careers. Palmer, age 30, had two more good years, and then was league average at best. But he is the exception here, having already had a few big years with lots of CGs. Moral of the story: Be careful with your pitchers.

REPLY - MPC - If I&#039;m a legit high school pitcher - I don&#039;t pitch my senior year and hardly at all in the summer]]></description>

REPLY - MPC - mixed him up with Seattle Bradley - my point stands - what adversity father drives a bus providing housing and food.]]></description>
