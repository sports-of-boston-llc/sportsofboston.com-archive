		<description><![CDATA[It is close between Pedro and Kershaw. Pedro&#039;s ERA-Plus (adjusted for the league and its average ERA) for his seven years in Boston is 190. Kershaw&#039;s average over the past six years is 182. But when you figure in the postseason, Pedro is still No. 1. Pedro also remains the all-time career leader in ERA-plus among starting pitchers, and Mo Rivera is the only other pitcher with a better one, and that&#039;s close.

REPLY - MPC - Juice and juiced ball make his run exceptional]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great stuff about the Arizona pitcher.  Reminds me of a story about Dustin Pedroia giving up his scholarship voluntarily his senior year at Arizona State so that they could give one to a pitcher that they needed.

REPLY - MPC - If the error isn&#039;t made in theory this kid&#039;s the winning pitcher for an NCAA championship - instead of being a selfish punk he becomes the epitome of teammate and friend]]></description>
