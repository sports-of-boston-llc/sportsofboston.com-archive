		<description><![CDATA[Pretty sure D&#039;Amico was a linesman.
Didn&#039;t Kerry Fraser stick it to us more than any other ref?
Especially in the Forum?

REPLY - MPC - Fraser&#039;s hair was always perfect]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[LOVE baseballreference.com.
Remy might be working harder, but he is still the master of stating the obvious and telling you what you just saw. Eck is much better.
As for the righty-lefty stuff, interesting stats, never saw them, but not surprising if you think about it. There are more righty hitters than lefty hitters, and platoon advantages exist. That is, there is a reason managers bring in righties to face righty hitters and lefties to face lefty hitters.

REPLY - MPC - fair points on righty lefty - agree on ECK - just know if NESN wears him out they will lose him for good]]></description>
