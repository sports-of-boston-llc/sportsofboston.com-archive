		<description><![CDATA[Your writer is clearly a Boston fanatic, but it&#039;s going to take more than one player( especially All Horford) to put the Celts back into contention for another World Championship. Now that Curry and Durant are both Warriors, the Celtics are going to need more than Horford to be competitive this upcoming season. At the time he wrote this, yes, the Celtics looked like they were in the running for Durant. But now that that Sun has set, my excitement level has leveled off. Hopefully I&#039;m wrong but your writer&#039;s enthusiasm is contagious!!! Go Celts!!]]></description>
