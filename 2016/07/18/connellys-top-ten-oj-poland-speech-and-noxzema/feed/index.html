		<description><![CDATA[it was a loss if you like to argue with trolls.  for anyone that discusses sports objectively, everyone knows how much of a farce the whole thing was.  brady was ultimately suspended because of contractual language for arbitration in a players union agreement.  not because the NFL proved he did anything wrong.  in fact, there is far more evidence suggesting corruption and indecency on behalf of the NFL compared to anything the patriots may or may not have done to footballs in the middle of january.

the most overblown, over-covered and stupid sports story in the last century.

REPLY - MPC - Just makes no sense that you pick on the face of the league - but Ben Volin wrote today - the 31 other teams mandated such action against the pats - interesting and bold statement]]></description>
