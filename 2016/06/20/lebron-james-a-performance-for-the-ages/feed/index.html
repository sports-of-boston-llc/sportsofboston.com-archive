		<description><![CDATA[Great takes from your writer who admits to his dislike of King Baby James.Move over Glen Davis. I too, cant stand his self-absorbed,fake,emotional crybaby act at the end of game 7. His performance on the floor however, has to be respected. I haven&#039;t seen this dominating a performance since Michael in the 80&#039;s with the Bulls, or Larry Legend on the parkay in the Garden. Hate em&#039;or Hate em&#039;but ever since he made the cover of SI as a High Schooler at Notre Dame, LeBron has been the exalted one. With this 2016 Championship and MVP, he finally lived up to the hype.If he could only find an  ounce of humility, I&#039;d respect him for more than his freakish performance on the floor.]]></description>
