		<description><![CDATA[OK - so according to the Obama administration, if a man self identifies as a woman - we all need to respect that and let him use whatever bathroom / locker room he wants without question.  

If a shooter self identifies as a Muslim ISIS fighter, we are not to believe him as to what his motivation is.

Let&#039;s blame conservatives and the Christian right.

It&#039;s unbelievable - I don&#039;t want to hear another lecture from him about xenophobia and gun control.  Call it what it is and do something about it.

REPLY - MPC - Fall of the Roman empire - they got soft]]></description>
