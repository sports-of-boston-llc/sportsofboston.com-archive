REPLY - MPC - Almost not worth the popsicle]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cafardo also still thinks Wade Miley was a good pitcher ...ERA over 5 in Seattle&#039;s Grand Canyon before he got hurt. But he ate innings! And got indigestion ...
Most damning comment on Brown at No. 3: No one standout NBA skill. Should have taken Dunn...a good point guard will make average shooters better, and who is a good point guard on that team?

REPLY - MPC - I agree on Dunn - sad result]]></description>
