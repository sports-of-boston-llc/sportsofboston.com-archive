		<description><![CDATA[I agree with your rankings on writers completely, Michael.  Bob Ryan is great on basketball, but Mr. Shaughnessy is the best on all other sports.

REPLY - MPC - Shaugnnessy and Clark Booth last of the old school writers]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Michael - putting Mr. Shaughnessy over Bob Ryan on your Mt. Rushmore of Boston Globe sports writers is absurd. Mr. Shaughnessy hasn&#039;t written anything informative in a very long time. He&#039;s more of a bad gossip columnist than he is a sports journalist at this point. Mr. Ryan taught so many about the joys and intracacies of sports (particularly basketball). Extremely surprising that anyone, let alone another sports journalist, would think that Mr. Shaughnessy is more accomplished than Mr. Ryan.

REPLY - MPC - I think Bob Ryan was great at one thing - Shaughnessy is the only media member in an entire town to have courage and challenge people]]></description>
