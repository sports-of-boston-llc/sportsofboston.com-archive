With Howard Cosell calling the fights from ringside, his tagline &quot;And Right There&quot; you saw the mastery of ring general ship and imposition of will on his opponents. From his &quot;I shocked the world&quot; proclamation at the victory over Sonny Liston to win his first World Championship to his battle with the U.S. Government in his opposition to the draft as a conscientious objector on moral and religious grounds. He was banned from boxing for 4 yrs. in the prime of his career. Ali transcended sports to become one of the most recognized people on the planet. His last fight against Larry Holmes was not the great fighter he once was. Many people have said that this fight along with the War he had with Joe Frazier in thier 3rd epic battle, took way too much out of Ali, and led to his sad physical state prior to his passing.Ali was truly a legend, in boxing and in life itself. He will go down in history as the greatest fighter to ever lace up a pair of gloves. &quot; Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee&quot;. Rumble young man, Rumble.]]></description>
