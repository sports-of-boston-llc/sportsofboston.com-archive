		<description><![CDATA[Behavior of Hamilton cast was a disgrace.
Edelman definitely dropped his shoulder and then realized what he did. very strange sequence.
Kapernick looked terrible. I know conditions were not ideal but how about mixing in a spiral?

REPLY - MPC - He looked like a pop warner player with small hands who couldn&#039;t hold on to the ball - while Brady practices with wet balls couldn&#039;t be better - he might also be the best bad weather QB of all time]]></description>
