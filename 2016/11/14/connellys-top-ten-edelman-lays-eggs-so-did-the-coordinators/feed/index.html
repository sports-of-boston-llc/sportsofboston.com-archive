		<description><![CDATA[Excellent analysis of the Pats game, Michael.  Defense is not good.  How can the two tight ends ever be stopped from catching the ball?  Why are they not targeted on every play?  The defense would need four players to guard them.

REPLY -mpc - the wide receivers would open up if they forced double teams on both sides - don&#039;t get it]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[-Average offensive line (Scarnecchia or not)
-Below average defense
-Butler is over rated, he&#039;s a good #3 DB, bot close to a shut down #1
-Defensive game plans continue to stink. When is Matt Patricia&#039;s sacred cow status up?  Oh, right, he&#039;s a rocket scientist, never mind.
-When Brady throws up one of his &quot;I&#039;m frustrated&quot; jump ball INTs, it&#039;s game over. 
-Two QB sneaks and beg for a PI call throw on 1st and goal for the tie was pathetic.
-Like the creativity on Briles, but he is too 3rd rail for coaching.   
-These guys will never get past a good defensive team in the playoffs.

REPLY - MPC - Good call on the Brady throw it up in the air / this was really concerning - especially if they have to go to Denver in the AFC championship game]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The actual action during an NFL game as measured from the ball being snapped until the play being whistled dead is about 13 minutes. That 47-minute figure includes teams lining up and QBs surveying the defense while players go in motion and referees spotting the ball. And when teams score, it goes PAT, two minutes of commercials, kickoff for touchback, two minutes of commercials. And they wonder why ratings are down.

REPLY - MPC - they better act before too late]]></description>
