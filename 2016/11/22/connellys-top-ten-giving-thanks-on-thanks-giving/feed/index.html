		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d move Orr ahead of Brady, he revolutionized hockey and remains the greatest player in the sport&#039;s history, easily the best +/- ever. Brady can win more and won&#039;t pass Orr or Russell. Look at all those titles for Russell, and he also had a tremendous impact on the game and made those around him better. And Ortiz belongs no lower than at No. 8, ahead of Espo, maybe even in a tie with Pedro. Just my 2 cents, enjoy the holiday!

REPLY - MPC - So Orr and Brady are greatest ever- Russell greatest defender and team player of all time - its a great problem to have - Ortiz over espo - I agree]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice list of Boston greats!  Gotta add Ortiz to my list; 3 championships, multiple clutch moments, marathon moment, great career, fans love him.

Thank you for writing the top ten, and for entertaining and commenting on our views.

Happy Thanksgiving!

REPLY - MPC - Ortiz definitely a miss - I moved him ahead of Espo]]></description>
