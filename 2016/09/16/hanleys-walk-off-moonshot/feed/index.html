		<description><![CDATA[What a fantastic ending that only the Red Sox could pull off!!! It was the BEST win of the season!! In other years, this was their trade mark winning in the bottom of the 9th ,so many walk off wins! David Ortiz and Hanley Ramirez, the stars of the game, and the bullpen,also did a fantastic job!!!]]></description>
