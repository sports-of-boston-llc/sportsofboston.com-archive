		<description><![CDATA[Pedroia numbers crazy

Manager of year, i hate saying this, but cancer victim who went from worst to first with a bunch of young over-achievers and two over paid (one overweight) free agents.  Whether you like him or not and I am in the not camp, Farrell will be considered and should finish top 3.

ear piece schmear piece it still didn&#039;t help her in the debate, i am not a trump fan but he won this round (GO JOHNSON!!).  People just don&#039;t trust her for many reasons.

reply - mpc - francona, showalter, Farrell - I agree he or the staff deserves credit]]></description>
