		<description><![CDATA[&quot;This day and age – who tells someone a score without asking – “are you taping?”

Don&#039;t know if you watched it, but reminds me of when Higgins spoils the score of the Tigers game for Magnum.

REPLY - MPC - I loved Magnum - I forget the part but I can picture that]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Michael the trade you propose with Cleveland is absurd they&#039;d never do it giving up their only good players and the number one for Jimmy G is not going to happen. On Jose Fernandez what articles am I missing it seemed like all his teamates really liked him and so did most players on other teams. Whole thing is sad but giving young kids millions and treating them as idols unfortunately things like this happen, hopefully people learn from it but your take seems very harsh.

REPLY - MPC - From everything I read about him he was extremely immature prone to tantrums and moments that showed he had a decent heart - this was not unexpected ending for many who knew him]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Beatles tour at today&#039;s value is still cheap - $60K in 1964 is approximately $460K today, and a $5 ticket is about $38 today. Can you imagine seeing the Beatles today for $38?

REPLY - MPC - My first thought was some agent on promoter made a killing off them]]></description>
