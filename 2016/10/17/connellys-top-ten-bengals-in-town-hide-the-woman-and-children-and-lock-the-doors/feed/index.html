		<description><![CDATA[it&#039;s a coincidence, or you could argue those politicians were easier to lampoon because a few of them were utter clowns - palin and trump, in particular.

REPLY - MPC - Clinton was pretty easy target, Obama obviously dangerous in today&#039;s world to parody him - jimmy carter considered the worst president was right in SNL best days]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great stuff as usual!  Doesn&#039;t matter if I agree or not, your lists are one of my favorite things to read and look to em on a daily basis. 

PS - Baldwin&#039;s Trump is so on it&#039;s scary.  Love it.

REPLY - MPC - Sometimes its better when we don&#039;t agree - gives me another perspective.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Love your Top 10s, but have to disagree with you on Baldwin. Thought he did a terrible job as Trump. Check out Anthony Atamanuik as Trump

REPLY - MPC - I thought Atamanuik was good not great - I like the 8th grader that did trump at his graduation]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ditto Fan of Mike. 

Mike if you wrote a weekly notes column for the Boston Globe as Will McDonough did, maybe I&#039;d buy that rag again. 

Suggestion. Put links to your books so it will make it easier to purchase them. Not that we can&#039;t Google them anyway.

Those who want to blame guns for violence are lazy &#038; cowards. 47K overdose deaths, 18K deaths by automobile, 8K by gun &#038; 200 by rifle (so called assault rifle). All our political leaders have been neutered.

REPLY - MPC - I give you permission to my agent with the Globe. thanks for reading!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[jay pharaoh played Obama on SNL.  he was ok, nothing stood out.  problem for them is that he left show just as this election heated up, so they don&#039;t have anyone on staff that can do it, and because he left so recently, he must not want / be able to return.

REPLY - MPC - Is a coincidence that all the good impersonations are those on the right? Reagan, Palin, Trump, Bush - the Hillary one stinks and they don&#039;t go at her anyways]]></description>
