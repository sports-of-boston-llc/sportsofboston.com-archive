		<description><![CDATA[so I did research that MSN article.  I thought based on your comments that it was a fan vote.  it appears to just be the the opinion of the article&#039;s writer.  while it is disingenuous on appearance, the writer does note that sports villains are presented &quot;in no particular order&quot;.

now, he led off with Brady/Belichick for a reason for sure.  but it should be said that he couched the list in terms that it doesn&#039;t represent a ranking.

I would say Brady would have made any generic list of sports villains prior to deflated ball situation.  people around the country do not like the pats on default.  I wish it were different but it&#039;s not.  and I frankly don&#039;t care about national perception.  smart sports fans know how much of a bag job the last 20 months have been.

MPC - REPLY - I sue if I&#039;m Brady and donate all the proceeds to a charity - tarnished his image forever - it will be in his obit]]></description>
