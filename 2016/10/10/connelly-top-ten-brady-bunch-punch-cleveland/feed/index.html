		<description><![CDATA[Couldn&#039;t agree more. Was telling my buddies yesterday while watching the Pats that I thought the Texas A&#038;M game along with the Miami Florida St game were two of the roughest physical games I&#039;ve ever seen. Florida St QB was getting murdered. Both games looked like Roller Ball.

		<description><![CDATA[what evidence you have for &quot;post season is for sacrifice bunting, moving the runners over, etc&quot;  Toronto didn&#039;t sac bunt their way to sweep vs texas nor do I remember Sox sacrifice bunting the years they won the WS.

reply - mpc - when I take over the Sox I believe in positive outs and reducing strike outs - your team I guess will be a bunch of Willy Mo Pena&#039;s HR or K]]></description>
