		<description><![CDATA[As always, love your Boston sports article, but really wish you&#039;d keep politics out of it.

REPLY - MPC - I know it bugs some people but I&#039;ve added &quot;other stuff&quot; to the top ten for the two decades I&#039;ve been doing it - I&#039;m open to some back and forth - is there something that I&#039;m completely off target on. Thanks for reading!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[(1) Gostowski. Worried, Yes.
(2) Pats may be led defensively by a rocket scientist but boy are those schemes elementary. They consistently make bad QBs look good.  Matt Patriaca gets a free pass in NE.
(3) You were like a DB biting on the pump fake on the Michele Obama&#039;s grandmother email chain. 
(4) NFL ratings factor that no one seems to talk about is impact of fantasy football. Sit next to a millennial in a sports bar on Sunday and try to figure out what team they root for...

REPLY - MPC - All good points - I did qualify my Obama comment BUT I did bit enough to wonder - Pats more than not are proven right but I think back to the AFC championship in Denver the time before last and they sat back and let Peyton pick them apart - at least go down fighting - it reminded me of Hagler in the first three rounds against Sugar Ray]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[True story: Steve Addazio once wanted the Cheshire, CT, school superintendent to call in a helicopter to blow a foot of snow off a high school field so they could play North Haven on Thanksgiving Day. I was there next to the field when he suggested it. Superintendent (a relative) politely declined, game played a day later.

REPLY - MPC - Guy is like a frustrated gym teacher - not a bad pay day to fail]]></description>
