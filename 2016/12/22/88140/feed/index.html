		<description><![CDATA[I Disagree about college players missing their Bowl Games. I personally don&#039;t like it, but if I was the kid, I&#039;d have to take care of numero uno. These colleges are making a bundle off of these players.
 
If anything colleges should make sure those players who generate huge dollars for their schools and are not NFL caliber, are employed upon graduating. 

Christmas List:
One more Brady/Belichich Super Bowl 
Michael Connelly replaces Curley Haired Boyfriend at The Boston Globe. Maybe I&#039;d subscribe again.

Tell the Globe I&#039;m in - I think these players use the colleges to showcase themselves as well - when they offer the scholar ship when they are 17 - these kids could stink but in theory still get their free school]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Parcells too high.  I&#039;ll take KC over Doc.  Love the Christmas List.

Merry Christmas to you!

Reply MPC - KC does get overlooked by a lot - me included - I agree with reader Danny F. Jerry York and Jack Parker need to sneak in on the list]]></description>
