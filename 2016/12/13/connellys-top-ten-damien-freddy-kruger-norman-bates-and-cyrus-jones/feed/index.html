		<description><![CDATA[I agree he can get taken down behind the line of scrimmage, but so can a lot of backs. Look what happened on the safety on the Ravens. But how about that poor dude who tried to tackle Blount a yard downfield on the right side and got pancaked?

reply mpc - he laid that guy out - when he gets his legs going he&#039;s fine - if a lineman gets pushed back - play is done]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is just you re: Blount. I heard a few weeks ago he led the league in yards after contact. I can&#039;t find anything more recent than this from late Sept. quickly on line, but I think it holds up: http://www.espn.com/blog/new-england-patriots/post/_/id/4796199/patriots-rb-legarrette-blounts-164-yards-after-contact-leads-the-nfl

REPLY - MPC - They said that on the broadcast - I&#039;m not sure what contact means - he needs to get going to break tackles and that means past the line of scrimmage which hurts him in short yardage]]></description>
