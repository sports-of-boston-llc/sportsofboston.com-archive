		<description><![CDATA[Pet peeves are spot on.  I think the slow drivers should be subject to the same fines as the lunatic darting in and out of lanes cutting people off - they&#039;re equally dangerous.

People who wrinkle their candy and popcorn bags during a movie should be subject to removal as well.  They have to come up with better packaging for theaters.  I lead the universe in giving the stink eye to people in theaters - never works, though.

reply - mpc - candy wrapper should be death - I&#039;ve been in theatres when people have brought crying babies - ugh!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When Edelman is gone, who will Brady throw to?  Why can&#039;t he focus on one of the other three (Hogan, Bennett, or Mitchell) once in awhile?  They must be open much of the time.  

Bennett is a huge target. Throw the ball up where only he can catch it.  

I thought Hogan&#039;s nickname was 7/11 because he is ALWAYS open.  

Edelman is going to get killed one of these days.

Reply - mpc - if Edelman makes it 19 games I&#039;ll be shocked]]></description>
