		<description><![CDATA[Patriots also stay because they want to make a country better. People who see flaws and protest and stay also love their country. It&#039;s easy to love perfection, but no person and no country is perfect. Are those who see problems supposed to stay silent? And how would you prefer they protest? Please think about that last question, because no matter how people protest, their manner of protest and their patriotism is questioned as a way to divert attention from issues they raise.

REPLY - MPC - As I noted - country has flaws and I&#039;ve said before that I&#039;m for protest (but not anarchy by some potheads that didn&#039;t even vote and can&#039;t even articulate their stand) - but again I&#039;m for protest - and to get your voice heard is difficult for anything whether a protestor or selling a product. It takes creativity and effort. With that said - blocking roads (and ambulances, and maybe an unemployed worker going to an interview, or a loved one getting a flight to see the birth of their child, etc), burning flags, kneeling during national anthem - all are counter productive and show a lack of appreciation on what made this country great. Not quite sure the raising of the fist works either - that is divisive instead of bringing people together (and I thought it was a problem with authority and not black / white issue - I&#039;m confused on that). These people are smart enough to figure out how to fill up a barrel with cement and chain themselves across route 93 at rush hour they can think of another way to get attention. I think a message that is cogent combined with a suggestive, realistic solution and not just stating problem is probably the best approach. 

I would say you could consult with those Cuban protestors but the guy on Kapernick shirt killed them all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great stuff on the Battle of the Bulge - really gives some perspective. Some people really don&#039;t get it. They like people like Castro and squint to find his good points yet they hate America. 

Kapernick is a perfect example - he won&#039;t stand for the National Anthem because America mistreats people, but wears a Castro t shirt. 

Thanks for the historical data - I love it every post.

REPLY - MPC - Hopefully the country now can start to reverse this self loathing and understand that despite our problems - the greatest and most charitable power in the history of mankind - lot to appreciate. I get it people disagree but they should also have a rational understanding of how fortunate they are relative to the rest of the world (funny thing is they secretly do but they can&#039;t say that because it hurts their persecution narrative - that is proven by the fact that they stay here).]]></description>
