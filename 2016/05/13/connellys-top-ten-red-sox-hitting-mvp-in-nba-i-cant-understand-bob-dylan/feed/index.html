		<description><![CDATA[Another Irish Boston sports name: Sean Shanahan.  Certainly, not a Mount Rushmore candidate, Shanahan only played 6-games during his Bruins tenure in 1977-78.  However, through no fault of his own,  he received some derision when the Bruins had him wear #7.  This was after Phil Esposito was traded &#038; before Ray Bourque arrived.

REPLY -MPC - Can&#039;t top that name]]></description>
