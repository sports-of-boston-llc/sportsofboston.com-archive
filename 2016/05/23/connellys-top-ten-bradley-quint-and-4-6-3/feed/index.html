		<description><![CDATA[wayyyyy back when you were blogging elsewhere and the tiger scandal broke... i wrote a comment that the PGA had better use caution when promoting mickelson as a family man and on the straight-and-narrow.  rumors existed even then about phil not being all that he seemed.

hard to complain about the red sox.  pitching is bunk but if they can secure someone / anyone to slot in behind price, they should roll.  i&#039;m hoping the yankees good run continues so i can get free furniture...

REPLY - MPC - Mickleson played his wife&#039;s cancer into millions of dollars]]></description>
