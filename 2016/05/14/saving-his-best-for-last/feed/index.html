		<description><![CDATA[This was the most exciting game of the season!!! The fans got what they wanted the most to watch DAVID ORTIZ tie the game in the 9th with a triple and win the game in the 11th with a double!!!
BIG PAPI is AMAZING!!! We all wish that he would stay another year,it won&#039;t be quite the same without him!!!
I just can&#039;t wait for the next game for more drama!!!!]]></description>
