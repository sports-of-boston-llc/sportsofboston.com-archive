But 2016 is a very different time in terms of how much time it takes to get a kid fresh out of college/high school to perform at a level that&#039;s competitive. Both the physical,and mental maturity are rarely present where 17-19 yr old kids are concerned. But Fans want instant results from thier teams and subsequently thier draft picks.The reason Red Auerbach was so successful at finding emerging stars, was his uncanny ability to see not how a player was performing today, but given the right direction and coaching,where he would be playing a year/18 months from now. Good article however. Kept me interested.]]></description>
